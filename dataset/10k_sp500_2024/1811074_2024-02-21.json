    "text": "General\nTexas Pacific Land Corporation (which, together with its subsidiaries as the context requires, may be referred to as “TPL”, the “Company”, “our”, “we” or “us”) is a Delaware Corporation and one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with approximately 868,000 surface acres of land in West Texas, principally concentrated in the Permian Basin.  Additionally, we own a 1/128th nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest (“NPRI”) under approximately 85,000 acres of land, a 1/16th NPRI under approximately 371,000 acres of land, and approximately 4,000 additional net royalty acres (normalized to 1/8th) (“NRA”), for a collective total of approximately 195,000 NRA all located in the western part of Texas.\nThe Company was originally organized as Texas Pacific Land Trust (the “Trust”) under a Declaration of Trust, dated February 1, 1888 (the “Declaration of Trust”), to receive and hold title to extensive tracts of land in the State of Texas, previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company.  The Declaration of Trust provided for the appointment of trustees (the “Trustees”) to manage the assets of the Trust with all of the powers of an absolute owner.  On January 11, 2021, the Trust completed its reorganization from a business trust, Texas Pacific Land Trust, into Texas Pacific Land Corporation (“TPL Corporation”), a corporation formed and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware.  TPL Corporation is an independent public company and its common stock, par value of $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”) is listed under the symbol “TPL” on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”).  See further discussion under “Corporate Reorganization” below.  Any references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the Company, TPL, our, we or us with respect to periods prior to January 11, 2021, will be in reference to the Trust, and references to periods on that date and thereafter will be in reference to Texas Pacific Land Corporation or TPL Corporation.\nOur surface and royalty ownership provide revenue opportunities throughout the oil and gas development value chain.  While we are not an oil and gas producer, we benefit from various revenue sources throughout the life cycle of a well.  During the initial development phase where infrastructure for oil and gas development is constructed, we receive fixed fee payments for use of our land and revenue for sales of materials (caliche) used in the construction of the infrastructure.  During the drilling and completion phase, we generate revenue for providing sourced and/or treated produced water in addition to fixed fee payments for use of our land.  During the production phase, we receive revenue from our oil and gas royalty interests and also revenues related to saltwater disposal on our land.  In addition, we generate revenue from pipeline, power line and utility easements, commercial leases and temporary permits principally related to a variety of land uses, including, but not limited to, midstream infrastructure projects and processing facilities as hydrocarbons are processed and transported to market.\nTPL’s mission is to pursue a thoughtful, long-term approach towards optimizing and building upon the commercial and environmental virtues of our extensive lands and resources.  TPL has a long history of responsible management of its legacy assets, and in recent years, the Company has expanded its business strategy to generate incremental revenue streams that take advantage of the Company’s vast surface and royalty footprint, such as its investments in the Water Services and Operations business segment.  Beyond TPL’s current businesses, the Company continues to explore new opportunities related\nto renewable energy, environmental sustainability, and technology, among others, that can leverage the already existing legacy surface and royalty assets.  The Company’s business model emphasizes high cash flow margins and relatively low ongoing capital expenditure requirements, and new opportunities would generally be expected to align with these priorities.  The Company remains focused on optimizing long-term value creation and profitability, fostering responsible stewardship of our assets, providing quality customer service, and engaging with and advocating for employee and stakeholder interests.\nCorporate Reorganization\nOn January 11, 2021, TPL completed its reorganization from a trust into a corporation (the “Corporate Reorganization”).\nAs part of the Corporate Reorganization, on January 11, 2021, shares of TPL Corporation’s Common Stock were distributed to holders of sub-share certificates of proprietary interest, par value $0.03-1/3 of the Trust (“Sub-shares”) on the basis of one share of Common Stock for every Sub-share (the “Distribution”).\nPrior to the Corporate Reorganization, as a result of a proxy contest mounted by certain holders of Sub-shares, the Trust entered into a stockholders’ agreement dated as of June 11, 2020 and amended as of December 14, 2020 (the “Stockholders’ Agreement”), with Horizon Kinetics LLC, Horizon Kinetics Asset Management LLC (together with Horizon Kinetics LLC and its affiliates, “Horizon”), SoftVest Advisors, LLC, SoftVest, L.P. (together with SoftVest Advisors, LLC and its affiliates, “SoftVest,” and together with Horizon, the “Investor Group”), and Mission Advisors, LP, (“Mission” and together with the Investor Group, collectively, the “stockholder parties”).  The Stockholders’ Agreement provided for, among other things, the appointment of Dana F. McGinnis, Eric L. Oliver and Murray Stahl as directors of TPL’s board of directors (the “Board”) in connection with the Corporate Reorganization.  Mr. McGinnis resigned from the Board in March 2022.\nPursuant to the Stockholders’ Agreement, the stockholder parties agreed to vote all of the shares of Common Stock they beneficially owned at each annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with the Board’s recommendations, subject to certain exceptions.  The termination date of the Stockholders’ Agreement was to occur immediately following the completion of the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, except that the respective obligations of the Investor Group were to survive until such time as neither Investor Group designee is serving on the Board.\nA dispute arose relating to the voting by the Investor Group on a proposal at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. The dispute was eventually resolved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, which ruling is now being appealed, but prior to such resolution, on July 28, 2023, the Company and the Investor Group entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) pursuant to which (i) Mr. Stahl, Marguerite Woung-Chapman and Robert Roosa would be nominated by the Company for election at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, (ii) the pre-signed conditional resignation letters submitted by Messrs.  Stahl and Oliver pursuant to the Stockholders’ Agreement were considered withdrawn and no longer effective, and (iii) the Investor Group agreed to vote or cause to be voted all of the shares of Common Stock over which the Investor Group has direct or indirect voting control for the election of the three nominees named above and against any director nominee not recommended by the Board, for proposals regarding approval of executive compensation and ratification of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and in accordance with the recommendation of the majority of the Board in respect of any proposals submitted by stockholders.  The Cooperation Agreement also provided for mutual non-disparagement covenants and certain standstill obligations for the Investor Group as long as one of Mr. Stahl or Mr. Oliver remain on the Board.  In addition, the termination date of the Stockholders’ Agreement was changed to occur following the completion of the 2023 annual meeting, which occurred on November 10, 2023.\nHistorical Operating Performance\nThe table below reflects our historical operating results for the last five years (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n2\nBusiness Segments\nWe operate our business in two reportable segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations.  Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses.  The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives of the Company and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.  See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 14, “Business Segment Reporting” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLand and Resource Management\nOur Land and Resource Management segment encompasses the business of managing our approximately 868,000 surface acres of land and our oil and gas royalty interests in West Texas, principally concentrated in the Permian Basin.  The revenue streams of this segment consist primarily of royalties from oil and gas, revenues from easements, commercial leases and renewables, and land and material sales.\nWe are not an oil and gas producer.  Rather, our oil and gas revenue is derived from our oil and gas royalty interests.  Thus, in addition to being subject to fluctuations in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalties are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells.  Our oil and gas royalty interests require no capital expenditures or operating expense burden from us for well development.\nOur revenue from easements is primarily generated from pipelines transporting oil, gas and related hydrocarbons, power line and utility easements, and subsurface wellbore easements.  Easements typically have a thirty-plus year term but subsequently renew every ten years with an additional payment.  In addition to easements, we also receive revenues from other surface-related operations on our land, including but not limited to, commercial leases, well development and material sales.  Commercial lease revenue is derived primarily from processing, storage and compression facilities, and roads.  Material sales include caliche, sand, and other material sales to operators.  Caliche is used in the construction of oil and gas-related infrastructure, and sand is utilized for completion operations.\nIn recent years, we entered into agreements with third parties related to renewables and various “next generation” opportunities that will potentially utilize TPL’s surface assets.  These agreements include the evaluation of grid-connected batteries, studies on carbon capture and sequestration, and development of bitcoin mining facilities, among other opportunities.  Generally, these projects are structured with multi-year terms that allow for feasibility and/or commercial suitability and revenue arrangements that provide royalty, fee, profit sharing, lease and/or rental payments, though contractual terms and timing for commercial operations will vary by project.  We do not anticipate these agreements will have a significant impact on our revenues in the short-term but do have the potential to contribute meaningfully to our revenues in the longer term.\nAs a significant landowner, we also generate revenue from land sales.  From time to time, we receive offers from third parties to acquire tracts of our land.  Sales demand and related sale prices of particular tracts of land are influenced by many factors, including general economic conditions, the rate of development in nearby areas and the suitability of the particular tract for commercial uses prevalent in West Texas.\n3\nOperations\nRevenues from the Land and Resource Management segment for the last three years were as follows (dollars presented in thousands):\nPlease see discussion of our financial results at Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Segment Results of Operations.”\nOil and Gas Activity for the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our share of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid (“NGL”) production was 23.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (“Boe”) per day compared to 21.3 thousand Boe per day for the same period of 2022.  The total equivalent price was $42.58 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 30.0% compared to the total equivalent price of $60.81 per Boe for the same period of 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the number of oil and gas wells that had been drilled but are not yet completed (“DUC”) subject to our royalty interest was 675 compared to 584 for the same period of 2022.  The number of DUC wells is determined using uniform drilling spacing units with pooled interests for all wells awaiting completion.\nCompetition\nOur Land and Resource Management segment does not have direct peers, as such, in that it sells, leases and generally manages land owned by the Company and, to that extent, any owner of property located in areas comparable to the Company is a potential competitor.\nWater Services and Operations\nOur Water Services and Operations segment encompasses the business of providing full-service water offerings to operators in the Permian Basin through Texas Pacific Water Resources LLC (“TPWR”), a single member Texas limited liability company owned by the Company.\nThese full-service water offerings include, but are not limited to, water sourcing, produced-water treatment, infrastructure development, and disposal solutions.  We are committed to sustainable water development.  Our significant surface ownership in the Permian Basin provides TPWR with a unique opportunity to provide multiple full-service water offerings to operators.\nThe revenue streams of this segment principally consist of revenue generated from sales of sourced and treated water as well as revenue from produced water royalties.  Energy businesses use water for their oil and gas projects while service businesses (i.e., water management service companies) operate water facilities to produce and sell water to energy businesses.\n4\nOperations\nRevenues from our Water Services and Operations segment for the last three years were as follows (dollars presented in thousands):\nPlease see discussion of our financial results at Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Segment Results of Operations.”\nActivity for the year ended December 31, 2023\nThe increase in water sales during 2023 compared to 2022 is principally due to a 21.8% increase in water sales volumes over the same time period.\nDuring 2023, we invested $15.2 million in TPWR projects to maintain and/or enhance water sourcing assets and acquired groundwater rights for $3.8 million to provide us access to additional water volumes outside of our existing surface footprint to assist in managing fluctuations in customer demand.  We also acquired a saltwater disposal (“SWD”) easement for $17.6 million.  The SWD easement covers approximately 49,000 acres and provides us future disposal opportunities to service injection customers seeking disposal solutions located outside of core basins.\nCompetition\nWhile there is competition in the water service business in the Permian Basin, we believe our position as a significant landowner of approximately 868,000 surface acres in West Texas gives us a unique advantage over our competitors who must negotiate with existing landowners to source water and then for the right of way to deliver the water to the end user.\n5\nMajor Customers\nThe chart below depicts our total revenues and revenues from customers representing more than 10% of our 2023 consolidated revenues:\nWhile approximately 43% of our 2023 revenue is derived from only three customers, two of these customers are in the top 10, and the remaining customer is in the top 35, energy companies in the world based on market capitalization, and we believe each of them is a strong and reliable operator.  Given their major presence in the Permian Basin and our significant surface lands in the same area, the high concentration of business with these three customers is expected.  Further, the choice of whom we do business with largely depends on location of mineral royalties and surface rights on or near our assets and consists of a limited universe of oil and gas companies who operate in the Permian Basin.\nSeasonality\nWhile the business of TPL is not seasonal in nature, as that term is generally understood, revenues from oil and gas royalties may fluctuate from period to period based upon market prices for oil and gas and production decisions made by the operators.  Our other revenue streams, which include, but are not limited to, water sales and royalties, easements and other surface related income and sales of land, may also fluctuate from period to period.  In addition, our results generally rely on the decisions and actions of third parties out of our ultimate control.  As a consequence, the results of our operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year.\nRegulations\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws.  Management believes that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive effect on our method of operations than on other companies similar to TPL.\nWe cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations.\n6\nEnvironmental Considerations\nCompliance with Federal, State and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have had no material effect upon our business generally, including the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.  To date, the Company has not been called upon to expend any funds for these purposes.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)\nIn August 2021, the Company published its inaugural Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”) disclosure highlighting data and processes that began in 2020.  The Company’s current ESG disclosure is available at the Company’s website at www.TexasPacific.com.  The ESG disclosure has been prepared in accordance with the frameworks of the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board, the Global Reporting Initiative, and the Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures.\nIntegrating sustainability and ESG objectives is a priority for our Company.  The Company’s ESG strategy reflects its dedication to meeting tactical business priorities while managing the environmental impacts of its operations, maintaining principles for social responsibility, and upholding a commitment to strong corporate governance.  Our ESG strategy is focused on the overarching priorities of environmental management, employee health and safety, workforce management and equality, community and landowner engagement, and strong corporate governance and ethics.  We are committed to sustainability and responsible stewardship across all of our operations and land management activities.\nAs the Company does not produce oil or gas from the land from which its royalties’ revenue stream is derived, it developed its sustainability goals and partnership opportunities in consultation with the entities operating on its land.  On the water solutions side of its business, the Company developed a tailored ESG program that addresses the ethical and responsible buildout of water assets and management of water as a natural resource.  The Company’s continued goal is an integrated and iterative approach to sustainable and responsible resource management.\nTPL’s ESG accomplishments and goals include but are not limited to:\n•\nConverted from a business trust to a Delaware corporation in January 2021, providing enhanced governance to the Company’s stockholders.\n•\nIncreased the electrification of the Company’s water assets in an effort to reduce costs and mitigate the overall emission profile of the Company by reducing reliance on diesel generators.  Cumulatively through December 31, 2023, TPL has spent $15.8 million of capital on electric infrastructure.\n•\nInitiated energy tracking in 2020 to monitor and identify trends in energy consumption and sourcing.\n•\nPrioritizing the health and welfare of TPL’s workforce.\n•\nEmployed practices for the tracking and monitoring of all spills, regardless if they are within or outside of regulatory reporting requirements.  We had zero spills of produced water in 2023 and 2022.\n•\nPartnered with oil & gas operators on the Company’s surface estate to collectively discuss and manage ESG risks.  Partnership opportunities included: developing renewable energy infrastructure across the Company’s land, developing water infrastructure to support the reuse and recycling of produced water—a critical response to climate change, partnering to develop innovative technologies that support emissions management, and more.\n•\nInstituted a governance framework that includes oversight and stewardship of the Company’s ESG strategies.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the Company’s policies and programs concerning corporate social responsibility, including ESG matters, with the support of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, where appropriate.  The committees provide guidance to the Board and management with respect to trends and developments regarding environmental, social, governance, and political matters that could significantly impact the Company.\nThe disclosure denotes that the Company’s ESG strategy, including metrics and targets, will be continuously reviewed and assessed annually to determine if updates or process improvements are needed.\nOur full ESG disclosure is available at www.TexasPacific.com/esg.\n7\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe we have a talented, motivated and dedicated team and we are committed to supporting the development of our team members and continuously building on our strong culture.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 100 full-time employees, of which 30 were employees of TPWR.\nOur business strategy and ability to serve customers relies on employing talented professionals and attracting, training, developing and retaining a knowledgeable skilled workforce.  We maintain a good working relationship with our employees.  We value our employees and their experience in providing value through land, mineral and water resource management and water solutions.  Maintaining a robust pipeline of talent is crucial to our ongoing success and is a key aspect of succession planning efforts across the organization.  Our leadership and human resources teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development.  We are committed to enhancing gender, racial and ethnic diversity throughout our organization.\nWe believe that diversity is an important factor in bringing people together, encouraging shared commitment and fostering new ideas.\nWe strive to be a great place for our employees to work.  Accordingly, we offer industry competitive pay and benefits, tuition reimbursement and continuing education classes and are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes employee productivity and satisfaction.\nEmployee safety is also among our top priorities.  Accordingly, we have developed and administer company-wide policies to ensure a safe and fair workplace free of discrimination or harassment for each team member and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards, as further discussed in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  This commitment applies to recruiting, hiring, compensation, benefits, training, termination, promotions or any other terms and conditions of employment.  We maintain our strong focus on safety and have taken measures to protect our employees and maintain safe, reliable operations.\nWe strive for a goal of zero occupational injuries, illnesses and incidents in our workplace.  To ensure that we protect our safety culture, we have in place a dedicated HS&E team with substantial combined years of experience and have in-house authorized trainers for OSHA-required certified training, powered equipment training and PCE-safe land certificated training.\nAvailable Information on our Website\nThe Company makes available on our website at www.TexasPacific.com, free of charge, its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).  Such reports are also available at www.sec.gov.  The information contained on our website is not part of this Report.\n8"

    "text": "An investment in our securities involves a degree of risk.  The risks described below are not the only ones facing us.  Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on us.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or business could be harmed.  In that case, the market price of our stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment in our stock.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur oil and gas royalties are dependent upon the market prices of oil and gas which fluctuate.\nThe oil and gas royalties that we receive are dependent upon the market prices for oil and gas.  When lower market prices for oil and gas occur, they will have an adverse effect on our oil and gas royalties.  The market prices for oil and gas are subject to US and global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions and infrastructure and logistical constraints, amongst others, and, in the past, have been subject to significant price fluctuations.  Price fluctuations for oil and gas have been particularly volatile in recent years due to supply and demand fundamentals, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and Russia (collectively referred to as “OPEC+”) actions, the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict and general economic cycles, among other factors.  These measures have at times resulted in a reduction of global economic activity and volatility in the global financial markets.  The scale and duration of the impact of these factors remain unknowable but could lead to a decrease in our revenues and have a material impact on our business segments and earnings, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe are not an oil and gas producer.  Our revenues from oil and gas royalties are subject to the actions of others.\nWe are not an oil and gas producer.  Our oil and gas income is derived primarily from perpetual non-participating oil and gas royalty interests that we have retained.  As oil and gas wells age, their production capacity may decline absent additional investment.  However, the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells make all decisions as to investments in, and production from, those wells and our royalties are dependent upon decisions made by those operators, among other factors.  Accordingly, a significant portion of our revenues is reliant on the management and actions of third parties, over whom we have no control.  There can be no assurance that such third parties will take actions or make decisions that will be beneficial to us, which could result in adverse effects on our financial results and performance.\nOur revenues from the sale of land are subject to substantial fluctuation.  Land sales are subject to many factors that are beyond our control.\nOur land sales vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter.  The total price obtained, the average price per acre, and the number of acres sold in any one year or quarter should not be assumed to be indicative of future land sales.  Our desire to sell and the demand and pricing for any particular tract of our land is influenced by many factors, including but not limited to: (i) access and location, (ii) the national and local economies, (iii) the rate of oil and gas well development by operators, (iv) the rate of development in nearby areas, (v) the livestock carrying capacity, and (vi) the condition of the local industries, which itself is influenced by a range of conditions.  Our ability to sell land can be, therefore, largely dependent on the actions of adjoining landowners.\nDemand for TPWR’s products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers.\nDemand for TPWR’s products and services depends substantially on demand and expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves.  These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ overall financial position, capital allocation priorities, and views of future oil and natural gas prices.  Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, which would adversely affect our earnings, cash flow and financial condition.  The results of operations for the Water Services and Operations segment have been impacted from time to time by reduced development pacing and declines in expenditures by our customers in response to varying industry or global circumstances.  Our results may continue to be impacted by producer discretion on development pacing and capital expenditures.\n9\nWe face the risks of doing business in a new and rapidly evolving market for TPWR and may not be able to\nsuccessfully\naddress such risks and achieve acceptable levels of success or profits.\nWe have encountered and may continue to encounter the challenges, uncertainties and difficulties frequently experienced in new and rapidly evolving markets with respect to the business of TPWR, including:\n•\npricing pressure driven by new competition;\n•\nvolatile and/or unexpected operating and maintenance costs;\n•\nlack of sufficient customers or loss of significant customers for the new line of business;\n•\nincreased regulation, including with respect to environmental and geological uses and impacts on industry operations; and\n•\nuncertainty with outsourced 3rd party provider(s) providing water treatment services.\nThe impact of government regulation on TPWR could adversely affect our business.\nThe business of TPWR is subject to applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including laws and regulations on water use, environmental and safety matters.  These laws and regulations may increase the costs and timing of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning water wells, source water and treatment facilities and impact our customers’ ability to transport, store and/or dispose of produced water in certain locations.  Due to increased seismicity in the Delaware and Midland Basins, the Texas Railroad Commission recently began implementing Seismic Response Areas (“SRAs”) limiting the permitted capacity and use of certain Saltwater Disposal Wells (“SWDs”) for the injection of produced water.  The implementation of SRAs could limit the volume of produced water disposed on the Company’s surface within the SRAs or, in certain cases, could direct additional volumes of produced water to SWDs on the Company’s surface outside of SRAs.  These limitations and/or redirections may cause TPWR to adapt its business plans and could affect TPWR’s financial performance.  The Company continues to actively engage with the Texas Railroad Commission and evaluate the potential effect of SRAs on the Company’s produced water royalties.\nOur business and financial results could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond our control\n.\nOur revenues depend on natural and environmental conditions with respect to operations that result in royalties to us, or that use our water services.  Our business and financial results are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond our control, including physical risks from severe storms, floods, droughts resulting in aquifer declines and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, pipeline disruptions, environmental hazards such as oil and produced water spills, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on oil and natural gas production and, therefore, our results of operations.\nOur business and financial results are subject to major trends in our industry, such as decarbonization, and may be adversely affected by future developments out of our control.\nMuch of the value of the land we own and upon which we receive royalties is based on the oil and natural gas reserves located there.  Our revenues may be negatively affected by changes driven by trends such as decarbonization efforts.  Such changes may relate to the types or sources of energy in demand, such as a shift to renewable sources of power generation (for example, wind and solar), along with ongoing changes in regulatory, investor, customer and consumer policies and preferences.  The evolution of global energy sources is affected by factors out of our control, such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies.  In addition, the possibility of taxes on energy sources, including oil and gas, may affect the demand for crude oil and natural gas and the operating costs for third party operators on our royalty properties.\nCyber incidents or attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection of our data, our business may be adversely impacted.\nWe and our operators increasingly rely on information technology systems to operate our respective businesses, and the oil and gas industry depends on digital technologies in exploration, development, production, and processing activities.  Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow.  Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of the operators on our properties, vendors, suppliers, and other business\n10\npartners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary, personal and other information, or other disruption of business activities.  In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for some period of time.  While we utilize various systems, procedures and controls to mitigate exposure to such risk, cyber incidents and attacks are continually evolving and unpredictable.  Our information technology systems and any insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient.  As cyber security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents.  There can be no assurance that our business, finances, systems and assets will not be compromised in a cyber attack.\nThe loss of key members of our management team or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.\nThe successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team, including with respect to the business of TPWR.  The loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business.  If we cannot retain our experienced personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nGlobal health threats may adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, such as the outbreak of COVID-19.  A significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population and resulting widespread health crisis could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn, reduced demand for oil and gas and interruption to supply chains related to oil and gas.  The reduction of economic activity and reduced global demand for oil and gas related to such outbreaks and actions taken by governments to mitigate the spread of a virus or other infectious agent could lead to an increase in our operating costs and have a material impact on our business segments and earnings, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe face direct and indirect supply chain risks that may adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be negatively affected by supply shortages and/or price increases driven by the increased costs of materials and logistics as a result of macroeconomic conditions, including the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict, general inflationary pressures, labor shortages, part or equipment availability, manufacturing capacity, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, natural disasters or pandemics and the effects of climate change.  Supply shortages and/or price increases could lead to a reduction in revenues and an increase in our operating costs and could have a material impact on our business segments and earnings, cash flow and financial condition.\nSupply chain issues may disrupt the operations and development activities of operators on our land, upon whom much of our revenue relies, which could negatively affect our revenues from oil and gas royalties, easements and our water offerings.  Supply chain issues could also lead to an increase in TPWR’s operating costs and disrupt its water sourcing and treatment operations, which could further negatively affect our revenues from our water offerings.  TPWR has adapted lead times for ordering parts and equipment to mitigate supply chain issues, but given the uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic factors and geopolitical situation, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer adverse effects on our business operations in the future.\nRisks Related to the Corporate Reorganization\nThe completion of the Corporate Reorganization may implicate conditions and covenants contained in certain agreements to which the Trust was a party and thereby may cause us to lose certain benefits that the Trust historically received.  If the Company is unable to obtain consents to, or approval or waiver of, any such conditions or covenants, or is unable to obtain an acknowledgement that any such benefits shall continue for the benefit of TPL Corporation, we may not be entitled to all benefits and other rights under such agreements, which may have an adverse impact on the business and results of operations.\nThe completion of the Corporate Reorganization may implicate conditions and covenants, contained in certain agreements to which the Trust was, and now TPL Corporation is, a party and thereby may cause us to lose certain benefits that the Trust historically received.  Certain counterparties may withhold consent to, or approval or waiver of, certain conditions or covenants in order to obtain more favorable terms from us.  If the Company is unable to obtain consents to, or approval or waiver of, any such conditions or covenants, or if the Company is unable to obtain acknowledgement from any counterparties\n11\nthat any such benefits shall continue for the benefit of TPL Corporation, then we may decide to enforce our rights and interests by initiating legal action.  In the meantime, and pending the outcome of any such legal proceeding to enforce our rights, we may be unable to continue to obtain all benefits and other rights under such agreements that would otherwise be transferred to us as part of the Corporate Reorganization. This may have an adverse impact on TPL’s business and results of operations.\nFor example, the obligation to pay ad valorem taxes with respect to certain of our royalty interests was assumed by a third party and is now the obligation of the successors in interest to such third party (the “obligors”), so long as such royalty interests are held by the Trustees or their successors in office under the Declaration of Trust.  The amount of such taxes depends on the valuations determined by various county taxing authorities with respect to our royalty interests and the tax rates used in assessing such ad valorem taxes.  Consequently, the amount of ad valorem taxes that may be assessed against our royalty interests may vary from year to year, and we are unable to reliably predict the amount of any such increases or decreases in future years.  We have received an indication from one such obligor that it does not intend to continue to make the ad valorem tax payments that it has been making to date.  We have accrued an estimate of such taxes and are making payments on a current basis in order to protect the royalty interests from any potential tax liens for nonpayment of future ad valorem taxes.  While we intend to seek reimbursement from the third party following payment of such taxes, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in getting reimbursed.  Taking on the cost of such payments will have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe Corporate Reorganization may have adverse tax consequences.\nWe have obtained an opinion from counsel that the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution qualified as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code.  The opinion of counsel does not address any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax consequences of the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution.  The opinion assumed that the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution was completed according to the terms of certain of the operative agreements and required regulatory filings, and relied on the facts as stated therein and in other ancillary agreements and documents.  In addition, the opinion was based on certain representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants by, us and the Trust.  The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants were incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or were violated in any material respect.\nThe opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and no assurance can be given that contrary positions will not be taken by the IRS or a court.  We have not sought and will not seek a ruling from the IRS regarding the federal income tax consequences of the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution.\nIf the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution were to fail to qualify as a reorganization or for tax-free treatment either under Section 368(a)(1)(F) or any other provision of the Code, then U.S. Holders of Sub-shares would recognize gain or loss, as applicable, equal to the difference between (a) the sum of the fair market value of the shares of TPL Corporation Common Stock received by such holder and (b) its adjusted tax basis in the Sub-shares surrendered in exchange therefor.  Further, the Trust would recognize taxable gain as if it sold all of its assets, subject to its liabilities, at fair market value.  The consequences of the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution to any holder will depend on that holder’s particular situation.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe cannot be certain that an active trading market for our Common Stock will be sustained, and our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nA public market for our Common Stock did not exist until the Corporate Reorganization was effected on January 11, 2021.  We cannot guarantee that the active trading market that has developed will be sustained for our Common Stock, nor can we predict the prices at which shares of our Common Stock may trade.\nUntil the market has fully evaluated our business as a corporation, the prices at which shares of our Common Stock trade may fluctuate more significantly than might otherwise be typical, even with other market conditions, including general volatility, held constant.  The increased volatility of our stock price following the Corporate Reorganization may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n•\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations due to factors related to our business;\n•\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n12\n•\nchanges to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate;\n•\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n•\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover, or positively cover, our Common Stock;\n•\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n•\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n•\ninvestor perception of our Company and our industry;\n•\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in commodities prices; and\n•\ndomestic and worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions.\nThere may be substantial changes in our stockholder base.\nInvestors in the Trust may have held Sub-shares because of a decision to invest in an organization with the Trust’s governance profile or operating track record.  Since the Corporate Reorganization, the shares of our Common Stock held by those investors represent an investment in a company with a different governance profile, in particular a board of directors at TPL Corporation subject to changes from year to year at annual elections of directors.  More frequent changes in the leadership of the organization, particularly on the Board, could lead to changes in the operating policies of TPL Corporation over time.  Such changes may not match some stockholders’ investment strategies, which could cause them to sell our Common Stock.  These changes may also attract new investors who previously did not invest in the Trust because of its structure, governance profile or operating track record.  As a result of such changes, our stock price may decline or experience volatility as our stockholder base changes.  Additionally, new investors or leadership at TPL Corporation could advocate for business or corporate initiatives that would not be desired by or beneficial for all stockholders, such as an untimely sale of the business.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activists.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and impact the trading value of our securities.  In the past, the Company has been the subject of stockholder activism, and we are subject to the risks associated with any ongoing or future such activism.  Stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and our Board, potentially interfering with our ability to execute our strategic plan.  We may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist stockholder matters, and the attention of our management may be diverted by such activism.  While we welcome our stockholders’ constructive input, there can be no assurance that stockholder actions would not result in negative impacts to the Company.  Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and the market price of our Common Stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by stockholder activism.\nIf our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is amended to allow for the issuance of additional Common Stock, holders of our Common Stock could experience dilution in the future.\nIf our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is amended to allow for the issuance of additional Common Stock, holders of our Common Stock could be diluted because of equity issuances for proposed acquisitions or capital market transactions or equity awards proposed to be granted to our directors, officers and employees subject to any required vote of holders of our Common Stock under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.  We may issue stock-based awards, including annual awards, new hire awards and periodic retention awards, as applicable, to our directors, officers and other employees under any employee benefits plans we have adopted or may adopt, using newly issued shares rather than treasury shares as is currently our practice.\nAt our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders voted on a proposal to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. A dispute relating to the voting on this proposal was resolved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, which determined that the proposal was approved by stockholders. The decision is currently subject to an appeal, and, therefore, we have not yet taken any action to amend the amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\n13\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more series of preferred stock having such designations, powers, preferences, privileges and relative, participating, optional and special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the Board may generally determine in its sole discretion.  The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our Common Stock.  For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of the members of the Board in all events or upon the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions.  Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Common Stock.\nWe may not continue the Trust’s historical practice of declaring cash dividends.  We will evaluate whether to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock in the future and we cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends, if any.\nThe timing, declaration, amount of, and payment of any cash dividends to our stockholders is within the discretion of our Board and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with any debt service obligations or other contractual obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.  Moreover, should our Board determine to pay any dividend in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends or the amount of such dividends.\nWe may not continue the Trust’s historical practice of repurchasing outstanding equity of its holders.  We will evaluate whether to repurchase our outstanding Common Stock in the future and we cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of share repurchases, if any.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 27,619 outstanding shares of Common Stock which repurchased shares were placed in treasury.  We expect that we will from time to time offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding Common Stock.  However, any repurchase will be within the discretion of our Board and will depend upon many factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our Common Stock, available cash and cash flow, capital requirements and the nature of other investment opportunities.\nState law and anti-takeover provisions could enable our Board to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover.  These provisions include, among others: (a) the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on our Board (except in an instance where a director is removed by stockholders and the resulting vacancy is filled by stockholders); (b) the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; (c) rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; and (d) the right of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that you may favor.  Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with persons that acquire, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal.  These provisions are not intended to make the Company immune from takeovers; however, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.  These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas as the sole and exclusive forums for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers.\n14\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the Company otherwise determines, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware) or the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, any district court in Dallas County in the State of Texas) will be the sole and exclusive forums for any derivative action brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders, any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents arising pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation or remedy under any provision of the DGCL, the laws of the State of Texas, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case, subject to the applicable court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants.  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that unless our Board otherwise determines, the federal district courts of the United States will be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision will apply to state and federal law claims, including claims under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.  The enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above, a court could rule that one or more parts of the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is inapplicable or unenforceable.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with the Company or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers.  Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition."

We have devoted substantial financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures to meet regulatory requirements, and we intend to continue to make significant investments to maintain the security of our data and cybersecurity infrastructure. There can be no guarantee that our policies and procedures will be properly followed in every instance or that those policies and procedures will be effective. Our risk factors, which can found be found in Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” include further detail about the material cybersecurity risks we face.\nWe have had no cybersecurity incidents to date, and can provide no assurance that there will not be incidents in the future or that they will not materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nCyber Risk Management and Strategy\nOverview\nWe employ a risk-based approach to cybersecurity which aligns with corporate strategy, risk management and governance, and adaptable information technology (“IT”) infrastructure.  Our cybersecurity program consists of policies, procedures, systems, controls and technology designed to help prevent, identify, detect and mitigate cybersecurity risk and is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity framework.\nCollaboration\nWe have integrated cybersecurity risk management into our overall risk management framework by (i) maintaining disaster recovery, business continuity and security incident recovery plans, (ii) conducting annual enterprise and IT risk assessments, (iii) implementing periodic key risk indicator tracking, and (iv) holding regular cross-departmental meetings to address cybersecurity risks.\nRisk Assessment\nOur risk management activities and cybersecurity strategy include IT policies, standards, procedures and systems to address and mitigate risks for critical system availability, network integrity, information protection, and operational continuity.\nWe perform vulnerability and threat monitoring mitigation activities on a regular basis and perform a cybersecurity risk assessment at least annually.\nOur cybersecurity risk assessment program includes the following assessments and activities:\n•\nensure program alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity framework; and,\n•\nprioritize, remediate and ensure effectiveness of critical applications, infrastructure, and information.\nWe regularly collaborate with the Company’s internal audit department and third parties with security and infrastructure expertise for review and evaluation of the Company’s cybersecurity risk program and the associated IT control environment.  We engage third-party service providers to perform annual external penetration testing, disaster recovery testing, and security incident simulations.\nInfrastructure; Network and Physical Security\nOur IT infrastructure is secured and continually monitored using a number of tools to effect physical and logical security. We strictly regulate and limit access to servers and networks.\nNetwork access is controlled by the network firewall and restricted by stringent access control lists.\nWe also employ (i) network and endpoint intrusion prevention and detection throughout our infrastructure, (ii) systems that monitor our infrastructure and alert our management of potential cybersecurity issues and vulnerabilities, and (iii) a seasoned process for managing and installing patches for third-party applications.\nWe have also implemented the following protective and preventative measures:\n•\nidentity management and access control safeguards;\n•\nencryption of data in transit and at rest;\n16\n•\nsystem and network security and monitoring;\n•\ninformation protection and governance; and,\n•\nongoing systems and equipment maintenance.\nIncident Response and Recovery Planning\nWe have instituted cybersecurity event detection systems, methods, and supporting processes to perform continuous monitoring, identify and classify events and anomalies, take appropriate actions when necessary and report incidents to the appropriate parties.  Our response and recovery capabilities are designed to, among other things, contain any impacts, analyze and mitigate events, track events to resolution, provide effective stakeholder communication, recover and resume operations, and evaluate and improve systems and methods.\nThird-Party Risk Management\nWe have implemented and continue to maintain the Company’s IT policies, standards, procedures, and controls to oversee, identify and manage cybersecurity risks associated with all third-party service providers.  These include, but are not limited to, an IT acceptable use policy, a records and information management policy, change control procedures, risk and control registry, attestation report reviews, and configuration standards.\nEducation and Awareness\nOur policies require each of our employees to complete annual information security training, in addition to other training requirements. The result is an educated, informed, and prepared workforce, with an awareness of potential cybersecurity threats, how they may occur, and how to report and escalate such matters. These training efforts are supplemented with regular corporate-led communications and outreach initiatives to facilitate cybersecurity awareness and ensure employees remain vigilant and informed about cybersecurity threats and trends.\nGovernance\nBoth management and the Board are actively involved in the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. TPL’s information security program is designed to ensure that management and the Board are adequately informed about, and provided with the tools necessary to monitor, (i) material risks from cybersecurity threats and (ii) the Company’s efforts related to the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.\nRole of the Board\nThe Board has delegated to the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”) primary responsibility for overseeing enterprise risk management, including oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats.  The Audit Committee periodically reviews TPL’s policies and practices, including incident response plans, for managing cybersecurity risks to ensure that such policies and practices are appropriately tailored to TPL’s risk framework.  Throughout the year, the Audit Committee receives quarterly IT and cybersecurity updates unless there is a notable event that requires immediate communication.  These quarterly updates include cybersecurity risk assessment updates from TPL’s Director of Information Technology, including key risk indicators, the steps management has taken to monitor and control such cybersecurity risk exposure, and continuous improvement efforts.  In addition to the risk management experience of the Audit Committee members, Ms. Duganier holds the CERT Cybersecurity Oversight Certification from Carnegie Mellon University.\nRole of Management\nTPL’s cybersecurity risk is managed utilizing a multi-tiered approach by the Company’s Director of Information Technology.  In addition to the Director of Information Technology, the Company also engages the services of a third party chief information security officer (“CISO”).  The qualifications of the Director of Information Technology include over 30 years of IT management, cybersecurity, and information governance experience.  The CISO, who reports to the Director of Information Technology, has 21 years of cybersecurity, IT management, and infrastructure consulting experience and is a certified CISO.  The Director of Information Technology is regularly informed about the latest developments in cybersecurity,\n17\nincluding potential threats, vulnerabilities, and innovative risk management techniques.  This ongoing knowledge acquisition is crucial for the effective prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.\nThe Director of Information Technology oversees risk management and strategy through (i) an IT operating committee (“the IT Operating Committee”) made up of the Director of Information Technology, the CISO, and the Company’s department heads, which is responsible for the establishment and review of the Company’s IT governance, risk management and compliance, and (ii) an IT steering committee (the “IT Steering Committee”) made up of the Company’s executives, which provides guidance and oversight to support and achieve TPL’s IT objectives, including cybersecurity.  Both the IT Operating Committee and the IT Steering Committee meet on a quarterly basis.  The IT Operating Committee reviews monthly reports on cybersecurity incident prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation and reviews the Company’s plans and policies related to IT processes on an annual basis.  The Director of Information Technology also coordinates with the Company’s internal audit department and the Audit Committee to ensure cybersecurity is represented and addressed within the Company’s enterprise risk management strategy.\n18"

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those factors presented in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.  For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, please refer to Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOverview\nTPL was originally organized in 1888 as a business trust to hold title to extensive tracts of land in numerous counties in West Texas which were previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company.  As discussed in Item 1. “Business — General — Corporate Reorganization,” on January 11, 2021, we completed our Corporate Reorganization from a business trust to a corporation changing our name from Texas Pacific Land Trust to Texas Pacific Land Corporation.\nFor an overview of our business and discussion of our business segments, see Item 1. “Business — General.”\nOur business activity is generated from our surface and royalty interest ownership in West Texas, primarily in the Permian Basin.  Our revenues are primarily derived from oil, gas and produced water royalties, sales of water and land, easements, and commercial leases.  Due to the nature of our operations and concentration of our ownership in one geographic location, our revenue and net income are subject to substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year.  In addition to fluctuations in response to changes in the market price for oil and gas, our financial results are also subject to decisions by the owners and operators of not only the oil and gas wells to which our oil and gas royalty interests relate, but also to other owners and operators in the Permian Basin as it relates to our other revenue streams, principally water sales, easements and other surface-related revenue.\nMarket Conditions\nGlobal Oil and Natural Gas Market Impact in 2023\nAverage oil and gas prices during 2023 have declined compared to average prices during 2022.  Oil prices continue to be impacted by certain actions by OPEC+, geopolitical factors, and evolving global supply and demand trends, among other factors.  Global and domestic natural gas markets have experienced volatility due to macroeconomic conditions, infrastructure and logistical constraints, weather, and geopolitical issues, among other factors.  In 2023, domestic natural gas prices have declined in part to growing supply.  Since mid-2022, the Waha Hub located in Pecos County, Texas has at times experienced significant negative price differentials relative to Henry Hub, located in Erath, Louisiana, due in part to growing local Permian natural gas production and limited natural gas pipeline takeaway capacity.  Midstream infrastructure is currently under construction by operators to provide additional takeaway capacity, though the impact on future basis differentials will be dependent on future natural gas production and other factors.  Changes in macro-economic conditions, including rising interest rates and lower global economic activity, could result in additional shifts in oil and gas supply and demand in future periods.  Although our revenues are directly and indirectly impacted by changes in oil and natural gas prices, we believe our royalty interests (which require no capital expenditures or operating expense burden from us for well development), strong balance sheet, and liquidity position will help us navigate through potential commodity price volatility.\nPermian Basin Activity\nThe Permian Basin is one of the oldest and most well-known hydrocarbon-producing areas and currently accounts for a substantial portion of oil and gas production in the United States, covering approximately 86,000 square miles in 52 counties across southeastern New Mexico and western Texas.  Exploration and production (“E&P”) companies active in the Permian have generally increased their drilling and development activity in 2023 compared to recent prior year activity levels.  Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), Permian production is approximately six million barrels per day, which is higher than the average daily production of any year prior to 2023.\n23\nWith our ownership concentration in the Permian Basin, our revenues are directly impacted by oil and gas pricing and drilling activity in the Permian Basin.  Below are metrics for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(1)    Commonly used definitions in the oil and gas industry provided in the table above are defined as follows:  WTI Cushing represents West Texas Intermediate.  Bbl represents one barrel of 42 U.S. gallons of oil.  Mmbtu represents one million British thermal units, a measurement used for natural gas.  DUCs represent drilled but uncompleted wells.  DUC classification is based on well data and date stamps provided by Enverus. DUCs is based on wells that have a drilled/spud date stamp but do not have a completed or first production date stamp. Excludes wells that have been labeled plugged and abandoned or permit expired and wells drilled/spud more than five years ago.\n(2)    Permian Basin specific information per Enverus analytics.  US weekly horizontal rig counts per Baker Hughes United States Rotary Rig Count for horizontal rigs.  Statistics for similar data are also available from other sources.  The comparability between these other sources and the sources used by the Company may differ.\nThe metrics above show selected domestic benchmark oil and natural gas prices and approximate activity levels in the\nPermian Basin for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.  Our oil and gas royalties are impacted by both oil and gas prices as well as production levels.  Oil and gas prices in 2023 have declined compared to the comparable period in 2022.  Despite declining commodity prices, drilling and development activities across the Permian generally remained strong in 2023.  As we are a significant landowner in the Permian Basin and not an oil and gas producer, our revenue is affected by the development decisions made by companies that operate in the areas where we own royalty interests and land.  Accordingly, these decisions made by others affect not only our production and produced water disposal volumes, but also directly impact our surface-related income and water sales.\nLiquidity\nand Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash flows generated from our operations.  Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for capital expenditures related to our Water Services and Operations segment (the extent and timing of which are under our control), working capital and general corporate needs.\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources.  If market conditions were to change and our revenues were to decline significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced.  Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding.  We have no debt or credit facilities, nor any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $725.2 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support our business, to repurchase our Common Stock subject to market conditions, to pay dividends subject to the discretion of our Board, for potential acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, we paid $100.0 million in dividends to our stockholders and repurchased $42.4 million of our Common Stock (including the share repurchases not settled at the end of the period).\n24\nWe acquired intangible assets of $21.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, consisting of a SWD easement and groundwater rights.  Additionally, we invested approximately $15.2 million in TPWR projects to maintain and/or enhance our water sourcing assets, of which $3.1 million related to water wells and related infrastructure acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of groundwater rights during the year ended December 31, 2023.  The SWD easement covers approximately 49,000 acres and provides us future disposal opportunities to service injection customers seeking disposal solutions located outside of core basins.  The groundwater rights provide us access to additional water volumes outside of our existing surface footprint to assist in managing fluctuations in customer demand.\nWe believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents balances, will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $418.3 million and $447.1 million, respectively.  Our cash flow provided by operating activities is primarily from oil, gas and produced water royalties, water and land sales, easements, and other surface-related income.  Cash flow used in operations generally consists of operating expenses associated with our revenue streams, general and administrative expenses and income taxes.\nThe decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, was primarily related to changes in working capital requirements over the same time period.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $60.3 million and $21.4 million, respectively.  Our cash flows used in investing activities are primarily related to land acquisitions, intangible assets such as subsurface easements, and capital expenditures related to our water services and operations segment.\nAcquisitions of intangible assets and land increased $21.4 million and $19.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022 and were partially offset by a decrease of $4.2 million in capital expenditures during the same time period.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $144.6 million and $336.8 million, respectively.  Our cash flows used in financing principally consist of activities which return capital to our stockholders such as payment of dividends and repurchases of our Common Stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we paid total dividends of $100.0 million, consisting of cumulative paid cash dividends of $13.00 per share.  During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid total dividends of $247.3 million consisting of cumulative cash dividends of $12.00 per share and a special dividend of $20.00 per share.  We repurchased $42.4 million and $87.9 million of our Common Stock (including share repurchases not settled at the end of the period) during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n25\nResults of Operations - Consolidated\nThe following table shows our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nCompared to\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nConsolidated Revenues and Net Income:\nTotal revenues decreased $35.8 million, or 5.4%, to $631.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $667.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.  This decrease was principally due to the $95.0 million decrease in oil and gas royalty revenue and was partially offset by the combined increase of $39.5 million in water sales and produced water royalties, and the $22.9 million increase in easements and other surface-related income, over the same period.  Individual revenue line items are discussed below under “Segment Results of Operations.”  Net income of $405.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 9.1% lower than the comparable period of 2022, principally as a result of both the decrease in revenues discussed above and the increase in operating expenses discussed further below under “Consolidated Expenses.”\nConsolidated Expenses:\nSalaries and related employee expenses\n.  Salaries and related employee expenses were $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $41.4 million for the comparable period of 2022.  The increase in salaries and related employee expenses is principally related to market compensation adjustments.\n26\nWater service-related expenses\n.  Water service-related expenses increased $16.1 million to $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022.  Certain types of water service-related expenses, including, but not limited to, transfer, treatment, and water purchases, will vary from period to period as our customers’ needs and requirements change.  Water sales, which increased 32.4% during 2023, were impacted not only by increased customer volumes, but also by higher demand within shorter time commitments and resulted in increased water purchase, treatment and transfer expenses.  While these dynamics in demand resulted in a 92.2% increase in water service-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, the operational decision to meet these demands resulted in increased revenues and operating income over the same time period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.6 million to $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $13.3 million for the same period of 2022.  The increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022 was principally related to increased expenses for technology applications and increased board fees due to the expansion of our board to 10 directors in April 2022.\nLegal and professional fees\n.  Legal and professional fees were $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $8.7 million for the comparable period of 2022.  The increase is principally related to legal expenses associated with stockholder matters.  See further discussion in Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nAd valorem and other taxes\n.  Ad valorem and other taxes were $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $8.9 million for the comparable period of 2022.  Ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 included payments for prior year ad valorem tax liabilities which had not been paid by the third party responsible for those ad valorem taxes.  Prior to January 1, 2022, the ad valorem taxes with respect to our historical royalty interests were paid directly by third parties pursuant to an existing arrangement.  Since the completion of our Corporate Reorganization on January 11, 2021, we have received notice from a third party that it no longer intends to pay the ad valorem taxes related to such historical royalty interests.  While we continue to believe the obligation to pay these ad valorem taxes should belong to the third party, we have accrued and/or paid an estimate of such taxes in order to protect the royalty interests from any potential tax liens for nonpayment of ad valorem taxes.  While we intend to seek reimbursement from the third party following payment of such taxes, we are unable to determine the amount and/or likelihood of such reimbursement, and accordingly, have not recorded a loss recovery receivable as of December 31, 2023.\nOther income, net.\nOther income, net was $31.5 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The increase in other income, net is primarily related to increased interest income earned on our cash balances during 2023.  Higher cash balances and interest yields during this period contributed to the increase in interest income.\nTotal income tax expense.\nTotal income tax expense was $111.9 million and $122.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The decrease in income tax expense is primarily related to decreased operating income resulting from decreased oil and gas royalty revenue and increased operating expenses.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe operate our business in two reportable segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations.  We eliminate any inter-segment revenues and expenses upon consolidation.\nWe evaluate the performance of our operating segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results.  The reportable segments presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in Note 14, “Business Segment Reporting” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We monitor our reporting segments based upon revenue and net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\nOur oil and gas royalty revenue, and, in turn, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 have been impacted by lower average commodity prices compared to 2022.  The decline in oil and gas royalty revenues has been partially offset by increases in revenues derived from water sales, easements and other surface-related income, and produced water royalties which have been positively impacted by ongoing development activity in the Permian Basin.\n27\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nCompared to\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nThe following is an analysis of our operating results for the comparable periods by reportable segment (dollars presented in thousands):\nLand and Resource Management\nLand and Resource Management segment revenues decreased $74.9 million, or 14.8%, to $432.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period of 2022.  The decrease in Land and Resource Management segment revenues is due to a $95.0 million decrease in oil and gas royalties for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022.  The decrease in oil and gas royalty revenue was partially offset by a $23.3 million increase in easements and other surface-related income over the same time period.\nOil and gas royalties\n.  Oil and gas royalty revenue was $357.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $452.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 21.0%.  Oil and gas royalties for the year ended December 31, 2023 included an $8.7 million recovery, discussed further in the following paragraph.  Excluding the $8.7 million recovery, oil and gas royalties decreased $103.7 million due to lower average commodity prices during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022.  The average realized prices declined 30.0% to $42.58 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $60.81 per Boe for the same period of 2022.  Our share of crude oil, natural gas and NGL production volumes was 23.5 thousand Boe per day for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 21.3 thousand Boe per day for the same period of 2022.\nAs part of an ongoing arbitration between TPL and an operator with respect to underpayment of oil and gas royalties resulting from improper deductions of post-production costs by the operator for production periods before and through June 2023, the operator has agreed to pay $10.1 million to TPL, comprised of $8.7 million of unpaid oil and gas royalties, $0.9 million of interest and $0.5 million of damages (the “O&G Settlement”).  The full amount of $10.1 million has been recorded as a receivable, $8.7 million has been included in oil and gas royalty revenue and the remaining $1.4 million has been recorded as other income in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The Company received payment from the operator for the full amount in January 2024.\n28\nThe table below provides financial and operational data by royalty stream for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and excludes the O&G Settlement discussed above:\n(1)    Commonly used definitions in the oil and gas industry not previously defined: Boe represents barrels of oil equivalent.  MBbls represents one thousand barrels of crude oil, condensate or NGLs.  Mcf represents one thousand cubic feet of natural gas.  MMcf represents one million cubic feet of natural gas.  MBoe represents one thousand Boe.  MBoe/d represents one thousand Boe per day.\n(2)    The metrics provided exclude the impact of the\n$8.7 million\nof oil and gas royalties from the O&G Settlement discussed above.\nEasements and other surface-related income.\nEasements and other surface-related income was $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 52.4% compared to $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.  Easements and other surface-related income includes revenue related to the use and crossing of our land for oil and gas exploration and production, renewable energy, and agricultural operations.  The increase in easements and other surface-related income is principally related to increases of $13.6 million in pipeline easements and $5.3 million in material sales (caliche and sand) for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022.  The amount of income derived from pipeline easements is a function of the term of the easement, the size of the easement and the number of easements entered into for any given period.  Easements and other surface-related income is dependent on development decisions made by companies that operate in the areas where we own land and is, therefore, unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period.  See “Market Conditions” above for additional discussion of development activity in the Permian Basin during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLand sales and other operating revenue\n.  Land sales and other operating revenue was $6.8 million and $10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 18,061 acres of land for an aggregate sales price of $6.8 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 6,392 acres of land for an aggregate sales price of approximately $9.7 million.\nNet income.\nNet income for the Land and Resource Management segment decreased 16.0% to $306.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $365.0 million for the comparable period in 2022.  Segment operating income decreased $98.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, largely driven by the $95.0 million decrease in oil and gas royalty revenue.  Expenses are discussed further above under “Results of Operations.”\n29\nWater Services and Operations\nWater Services and Operations segment revenues increased 24.3%, to $199.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with $160.4 million for the comparable period of 2022.  The increase in Water Services and Operations segment revenues is principally due to increases in water sales revenue and produced water royalties, which are discussed below.  As discussed in “Market Conditions” above, our segment revenues are directly influenced by development decisions made by our customers and the overall activity level in the Permian Basin.  Accordingly, our segment revenues and sales volumes, as further discussed below, will fluctuate from period to period based upon those decisions and activity levels.\nWater sales\n.  Water sales revenue increased $27.5 million, or 32.4% to $112.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022.  The growth in water sales is principally due to an increase of 21.8% in water sales volumes for the years ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nProduced water royalties.\nProduced water royalties are royalties received from the transfer or disposal of produced water on our land.  Produced water royalties are contractual and not paid as a matter of right.  We do not operate any salt water disposal wells.  Produced water royalties were $84.3 million  for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $72.2 million for the same period in 2022.  This increase is principally due to increased produced water volumes for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022.\nNet income\n.  Net income for the Water Services and Operations segment was $98.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.  Segment operating income increased $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022.  The increase is principally due to the $39.0 million increase in segment revenues which were partially offset by the $16.1 million increase in water service-related expenses and the $5.4 million increase in income tax expense.  Expenses are discussed further above under “Results of Operations.”\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\nIn addition to amounts presented in accordance with GAAP, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP performance measurements.  These measurements are not to be considered more relevant or accurate than the measurements presented in accordance with GAAP.  In compliance with the requirements of the SEC, our non-GAAP measurements are reconciled to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure.  For all non-GAAP measurements, neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on these non-GAAP measurements.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization.  Its purpose is to highlight earnings without finance, taxes, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and its use is limited to specialized analysis.  We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding employee share-based compensation.  Its purpose is to highlight earnings without non-cash activity such as share-based compensation and/or other non-recurring or unusual items.  We calculate Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less current income tax expense and capital expenditures.  Its purpose is to provide an additional measure of operating performance.  We have presented EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow because we believe that these metrics are useful supplements to net income in analyzing the Company's operating performance.  Our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.\n30\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (in thousands):\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.  It is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Consistent with our disclosure policies, we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.\nAccrual of Oil and Gas Royalties\nThe Company accrues oil and gas royalties.  An accrual is necessary due to the time lag between the removal of crude oil and natural gas products from the respective mineral reserve locations and generation of the actual payment by operators.  The oil and gas royalty accrual is based upon historical production volumes, estimates of the timing of future payments and recent market prices for oil and gas.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor further information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”"

Based on this assessment, our CEO and CFO concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.  Deloitte & Touche LLP's opinion appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n32\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Texas Pacific Land Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Texas Pacific Land Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Representation Letter.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nDallas, Texas\nFebruary 21, 2024\n33"

A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on the Company’s corporate website at www.TexasPacific.com.  The information contained on our website is not part of this Report.  We intend to disclose any amendment to, or waiver of, a provision of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC.\n39\nCommunication with Directors\nThe Board is committed to meaningful engagement with stockholders and other interested persons and welcomes input and suggestions.  Information regarding how stockholders can contact the Chair or non-management members of the Board is set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines that are posted on our website, www.TexasPacific.com.  Stockholders and other interested persons who wish to contact the Board may do so by submitting any communications to the Company by mail at 1700 Pacific Avenue, Suite 2900, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Investor Relations.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight\nMr. Best serves as the chair of the Board (the “Chair”).  The Chair of the Board is an independent director.  The Company believes that having an independent chair of the Board will provide independent leadership for the Board and help ensure critical and independent thinking with respect to the Company’s strategy and performance.  Our Chief Executive Officer is also expected to serve as a member of the Board as the management representative.  The Company believes this is important to make information and insight directly available to the directors in their deliberations.  This structure gives the Company an appropriate, well-functioning balance between non-management and management directors that combines experience, accountability, and effective risk oversight.  The duties of the Chair are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and include chairing Board meetings and meetings of stockholders, except as otherwise provided by our Bylaws, establishing the agenda for each Board meeting, leading executive sessions of the Board (if the Chair qualifies as independent), having authority to call Board meetings, approving meeting schedules for the Board and information distributed to the Board, consulting with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with regard to the membership and performance evaluations of the Board and committee members, and performing such other duties and responsibilities as requested by the Board.\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines allow for the Chair of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer roles to be filled by a single individual.  In the event the Chair does not qualify as independent, the independent directors shall select from among themselves a lead independent director.  The duties of a lead independent director are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and include chairing Board meetings in the absence of the Chair, convening and leading executive sessions of the Board, serving as a liaison between the Chair and the independent directors, being available for consultation and director communication with major stockholders as directed by the Board, and performing such other duties and responsibilities as requested by the Board.\nThe Company believes that risk oversight is the responsibility of the Board as a whole and not solely of any one of its committees.  The Board periodically reviews the processes established by management to identify and manage risks and communicates with management about these processes.  In addition to these measures, the Audit Committee regularly discusses policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, the Company’s major litigation and financial risk exposures, compliance, cybersecurity, information technology and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, and the Compensation Committee oversees risks arising from the Company’s compensation and employee benefits plans, policies and programs for its employees.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with assistance from the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, oversees our ESG program and monitors related risks.  The Board, and the various committee chairs, address any issues identified in such discussions and reviews with management as they arise, and monitors actions, procedures or processes implemented in response.\nOur General Counsel serves as our chief compliance officer, and periodically reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s compliance programs and responds to, and monitors the status and response to, compliance issues that may arise from time to time.  The General Counsel reports to the Chief Executive Officer.\nAudit Committee Procedures; Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions\nThe Audit Committee meets separately and periodically with the Company’s independent auditor, the Company’s chief financial officer and a representative of the internal audit function to assess certain matters, including the status of the independent audit process, management and the independent auditor’s assessments of the Company’s financial reporting and internal controls and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and management’s views as to the competence, performance and independence of the independent auditor.  The Audit Committee oversees the internal audit function, including its structure, personnel, budget, and annual internal audit plans.  In addition, the Audit Committee, as a whole, reviews and meets to discuss the annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements with management and the independent auditor.  The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to the Board each year as to whether the annual audited financial statements should be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n40\nInformation about the procedures for approval of related person transactions is available below in Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence — Transactions with Related Persons.”\nQualifications and Nominations of Directors\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter provides that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee screen, recruit and interview individuals that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes are qualified to become members of the Board, consistent with criteria approved by the Board from time to time, and to recommend to the Board the (a) director nominees to be selected by the Board to stand for election or re-election at the annual meeting of stockholders and (b) director candidates to be appointed by the Board to fill vacancies and newly created directorships.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews periodically the size of the Board and oversees an annual self-evaluation of the Board and its committees.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also consider such other factors as it may deem to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nWhenever the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee concludes, based on the reviews or considerations described above or due to a vacancy, that a new nominee to the Board is required or advisable, it will consider recommendations from directors, management, stockholders and, if it deems appropriate, consultants retained for that purpose.  In such circumstances, it will evaluate individuals recommended by stockholders in the same manner as nominees recommended from other sources.  Stockholders who wish to nominate an individual for election as a director directly, without going through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, must comply with the procedures in the Company’s amended and restated bylaws.  The Company’s amended and restated bylaws are provided on our website at www.TexasPacific.com.\nOur Board has adopted a “majority vote policy.”  Under this policy any nominee for director in an uncontested election who does not receive a majority of the votes cast is required to tender his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the tendered resignation and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation.\nInsider Trading Policy; Anti-Hedging Policy\nWe have an Insider Trading Policy that sets forth terms, conditions, timing, limitations, and prohibitions with respect to trading in the Company’s securities.  The Insider Trading Policy prohibits all employees, executive officers, directors, agents, consultants and contractors from trading in the Company’s securities while in possession of material nonpublic information.  Such persons are also generally prohibited from hedging, including engaging in publicly-traded options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments relating to the Company’s securities, or selling the Company’s securities “short.”  The Insider Trading Policy also requires that such persons obtain pre-approval from the Company’s General Counsel for all pledges, and the deposit in margin accounts, of the Company’s securities and the securities of any other company designated by the Company’s General Counsel.  The Insider Trading Policy also restricts directors, officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and certain other specifically designated employees from trading in the Company’s securities during certain periods and only after they have obtained pre-clearance for trades in the Company’s securities from the Company’s General Counsel (or, in the case of the General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer).\nClawback Policy\nThe Company has adopted a Clawback Policy in accordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and Rule 10D-1 promulgated thereunder (collectively, “Section 10D”).  In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any such financial reporting requirement, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period, the Clawback Policy requires that covered executives must reimburse the Company, or forfeit, any excess incentive compensation received by such covered executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare the restatement.  Executives covered by the Clawback Policy are current and former executive officers, as determined by the Board in accordance with Section 10D and the listing standards of the NYSE. Incentive compensation subject to the Clawback Policy includes any cash or equity compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure as defined in Section 10D.  The amount subject to recovery is the excess of the incentive compensation received based on the erroneous data over the incentive compensation that would have been received had it been based on the restated results.\n41\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nPlease see our ESG discussion in Item 1. “Business.”\nHuman Capital\nPlease see our Human Capital Resources discussion in Item 1. “Business.”\nBoard of Directors\nThe Board currently consists of ten (10) directors, nine (9) of whom - Mr. Best, Gen.

Dobbs, our Senior Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel\nExecutive Summary\nTPL was originally organized in 1888 as a business trust to hold title to extensive tracts of land in numerous counties in West Texas which were previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company.  On January 11, 2021, we completed our Corporate Reorganization from a business trust to a corporation changing our name from Texas Pacific Land Trust to Texas Pacific Land Corporation.\nOur business activity is generated from our surface and royalty interest ownership in West Texas, primarily in the Permian Basin.  Our revenues are derived from oil, gas and produced water royalties, sales of water and land, easements and commercial leases.  Due to the nature of our operations and concentration of our ownership in one geographic location, our\n43\nrevenue and net income are subject to substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year.  In addition to fluctuations in response to changes in the market price for oil and gas, our financial results are also subject to decisions by the owners and operators of not only the oil and gas wells to which our oil and gas royalty interests relate, but also to other owners and operators in the Permian Basin as it relates to our other revenue streams, principally water sales, easements and other surface-related revenue.\nBusiness and Financial Performance 2023 Highlights\n•\nNet income of $405.6 million, or $52.81 per share (basic) and $52.77 (diluted)\n•\nRevenues of $631.6 million\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(1)\nof $541.4 million\n•\nFree cash flow\n(1)\nof $415.5 million\n•\nRoyalty production of 23.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day\n•\nTotal cash dividends of $13.00 per share paid during 2023\n•\nPublished annual update of ESG disclosure, including metrics for 2022\n(1)    Reconciliations of Non-GAAP measures are provided in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Performance Measures.”\nKey Aspects of 2023 Design\nFollowing a substantial redesign of our compensation programs in 2022, the Compensation Committee generally maintained the overall program structure in 2023.  This program design is based on typical practices among our Reference Group (see below) while reflecting the unique aspects of TPL.  The compensation program design is intended to meet the following objectives:\n•\nAlign executives’ financial interests more closely with stockholders;\n•\nTie executive compensation with long-term performance (both stock price and financial performance) incorporating risk into the awards, while relying heavily on formulaic incentive compensation;\n•\nIncorporate long-term vesting periods to help ensure continuity of the management team;\n•\nEnsure transparency for participants and stockholders about how outcomes are determined with an appropriate and competitive level of pay at risk;\n•\nMeet common governance standards for public companies, and assess and control the program to avoid creating undue risk or encouraging excessive risk-tasking by executives; and\n•\nEnsure a competitive compensation program.\nWe believe that our program, including awards under the 2021 Incentive Plan, has an appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to our overall business strategy and that the balance of compensation elements discourages excessive risk-taking.\nWe have maintained this general structure for 2024.\nDecision-Making Process\nCompensation Philosophy and Approach\nTPL’s 2023 executive compensation program is designed to recruit and retain an executive team and to reward performance in achieving TPL’s goals of protecting and maintaining the assets of TPL.  The 2023 executive compensation\n44\nprogram consists principally of a salary, an annual cash bonus (sometimes referred to as awards under a non-equity incentive plan commencing in 2022), and share-based compensation. Base salaries provide our Named Executive Officers with a steady income stream that is not contingent on TPL’s performance.  Differences in salary for the Named Executive Officers may reflect the differing responsibilities of their respective positions, the differing levels of experience of the individuals and internal pay-equity considerations.  The cash bonus allows the Compensation Committee flexibility to recognize and reward the Named Executive Officers’ contributions to TPL’s performance in any given year.  Salaries are reviewed annually, and salary adjustments and the amounts of cash bonuses are determined by the Compensation Committee and the Board, as applicable, based upon an evaluation of the Named Executive Officer’s performance and contributions, as well as overall performance of the Company, against the goals and objectives of TPL in accordance with the relevant employment agreements in effect, as applicable.  Share-based compensation awards link pay to performance and aligns executive officers’ interests with those of the Company and its stockholders over the long term.\nAs part of its compensation program, TPL maintains both a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a qualified defined contribution plan which are both available to employees generally, as well as to the Named Executive Officers.  These plans are designed to assist employees in planning for their retirement.\nConsideration of 2023 Say on Pay Vote\nAt our November 2023 stockholder meeting, the majority of our stockholders voted to approve our executive compensation program, with approximately 81% approval among votes cast.  The Compensation Committee viewed this as support of its approach and philosophy and as a basis for continuing with the program described in this CD&A for 2023.\nFollowing our lower support in 2022, at the direction of our Compensation Committee, TPL management reached out to 10 of our largest stockholders, representing more than 20% of our outstanding shares, to discuss our executive compensation program along with other topics of importance to them, including governance, sustainability and strategy.  Four stockholders representing approximately 10% of our outstanding shares accepted our invitation to share feedback, and members of management and of the Board engaged at length with them.  The remaining six stockholders we contacted either did not respond or confirmed that they did not have any concerns with our executive compensation program and therefore no engagement was necessary.\nIndependent members of our Board participated in and led each of these meetings with stockholders.  Each meeting included some combination of our Compensation Committee Chair and at least one other member of the Board.  They were joined in these meetings by most or all of the Company’s CEO, CFO, Secretary and General Counsel and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\nFollowing these meetings, the Compensation Committee met with senior management to discuss what we learned during this comprehensive outreach process.  In general, we learned that institutional stockholders were not seeking significant changes to our compensation program; many expressed support for our overall compensation philosophy and instead suggested modest changes, including enhancing our proxy statement disclosures and increasing the proportion of performance-based equity over time.\nIn response to this feedback, we have added new disclosures to our proxy statement intended to provide greater transparency into the functioning of our executive compensation program.  Additionally, we intend to evolve our compensation program over time, and we may make further changes to the structure of our compensation program based on the needs of the Company.\nRole of the Committee\nThe Compensation Committee has the sole authority to determine the compensation of the Named Executive Officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and to make recommendations to the Board, which has the authority to make final decisions, with respect to the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer.  The Compensation Committee is also responsible for developing and overseeing an equity compensation program for the Company generally for other employees, and for making recommendations to the Board with respect to compensation for non-employee directors, with assistance from the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant.\nIn establishing the Named Executive Officers’ compensation for 2023, the Compensation Committee Chair and the full Compensation Committee met multiple times, including with management and/or the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant, to review market practices, evaluate potential alternatives, determine appropriate metrics and goals, and review strategic goals and performance.\n45\nRole of Management\nOur CEO, Mr. Glover, provided recommendations for compensation for his direct reports.  Additionally, the management team provided the Compensation Committee with financial performance information to assist with the assessment of company and individual performance in determining the bonuses for 2023.  The Compensation Committee considered this information in its decision-making process.  No member of management participated in discussions relating to his or her own compensation.\nRole of the Independent Consultant\nSince 2021, the Compensation Committee has used Meridian as its independent compensation consultant to assist the Compensation Committee in fulfilling its responsibilities related to the oversight of TPL Corporation’s executive officer and non-employee director compensation.  The Compensation Committee determined that Meridian was independent from management based upon the consideration of various relevant factors, including that Meridian did not provide any services to TPL except advisory services to the Compensation Committee, and that Meridian had and adhered to policies and procedures that were designed to prevent conflicts of interests.\nThe independent compensation consultant advises the Compensation Committee in the development of pay strategies regarding our executive officers, including our CEO, and non-employee directors.  The Compensation Committee reviews and discusses matters involving executive officer and non-employee director compensation. Following this review, the Compensation Committee makes a determination and/or recommendation to the Board, as applicable under the Compensation Committee’s charter, regarding, among other things (a) the compensation of the CEO and the compensation of executive officers other than the CEO, in each case including salary, bonus, benefits, incentive awards and perquisites, and (b) compensation for TPL’s non-employee directors.\nBenchmarking Process\nDetermining the 2023 Compensation Program\nAs described below, the Compensation Committee asked Meridian to review market data as part of the process of  establishing 2023 compensation for our Named Executive Officers.  As part of this process, the Compensation Committee noted that TPL is a unique organization in a number of ways:\n•\nIt is the largest publicly-traded mineral royalty focused organization, with a market capitalization more than double the next largest publicly-traded mineral royalty focused organization;\n•\nUnlike most mineral royalty focused organizations, TPL also owns and manages a large amount of surface rights;\n•\nThese surface rights allow the creation of additional business lines, such as our water business and Surface Leases, Easements and Material (referred to as “SLEM”);\n•\nTPL’s legacy assets carry zero basis on the balance sheet; and\n•\nTPL’s financial profile is unusual with no debt, limited book assets, and high margins.  TPL also returns a significant portion of its cash flow to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAs a result of these unique characteristics, TPL does not have any direct peers.  Instead of reviewing peer group market data, the Compensation Committee asked Meridian to review compensation for a group of comparable reference companies (the “Reference Group”).  The Reference Group (listed below) represents companies which operate in ancillary businesses such as royalty companies, midstream companies, and E&P companies that have business lines similar to TPL and are similar in market capitalization, enterprise value, and/or Adjusted EBITDA.\n46\nMarket data from this Reference Group, plus additional broad survey data from general industry and the E&P industry, was used by the Compensation Committee as a reference to help determine the 2023 compensation program design and individual pay levels as well as in determining the 2023 compensation, which is described below.  During 2023, in preparation for decisions regarding 2024 compensation, the Compensation Committee refreshed the listing of companies in the Reference Group to account for mergers/acquisitions occurring during 2023.  The following companies were removed from the Reference Group for 2024: DCP Midstream, LP, Crestwood Equity Partners LP, and Magellan Midstream Partners (Midstream Companies) and PDC Energy, Inc. (E&P Companies).  The following companies were added to the Reference Group for 2024: Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (Royalty Companies) and DT Midstream, Inc. (Midstream Companies).\n2023 Compensation Program\nTPL’s 2023 executive compensation program is designed to reward performance in achieving TPL’s goals of protecting and maintaining the assets of TPL as detailed below.\nBase Salaries\nOur Named Executive Officers receive a base salary to provide a competitive level of fixed compensation based on each individual’s role, experience, qualifications, and individual performance.  The base salaries as of the end of 2023 for our Named Executive Officers were as follows:\nThe base salary for Mr. Glover is unchanged from 2022.  The Compensation Committee increased the base salaries for Mr. Steddum and Mr. Dobbs for 2023 to better align with market data from the Reference Group.\n2023 Annual Incentive Targets\nEach of the executive officers has a target bonus expressed as a percentage of salary established based on references to market data as described above.  The target bonuses as a percentage of salary for each of our Named Executive Officers for 2023 is as follows:\nThese are unchanged from 2022.\nThe Committee has also established a structured annual incentive program, with goals tied to key metrics for the company.  For 2023, the metrics included two financial metrics (Adjusted EBITDA Margin % and Free Cash Flow/share (FCF/share)) as well as several strategic objectives, as outlined below.\n47\n2023\nAnnual (Short-Term) Incentive Program Summary\nGoals for each of the 2023 metrics were established at the beginning of 2023, based on expectations for the year.  The Threshold, Target, and Maximum level of performance for each financial metric are outlined below.  At Threshold, Target, and Maximum performance levels, 50%, 100%, and 200% of the target bonus would be earned, respectively, for each metric.\nTPL’s performance against the pre-established financial goals can be heavily influenced by the impact of changes in commodity prices.  To mitigate this impact, the Committee implemented a commodity adjustment calculation, which uses a collar on commodity prices.  Within the collar range, no adjustment is made for commodity prices.  If commodity prices fall below or rise above the collar range, a floor or cap on prices is applied.  This provides our management team with some exposure to commodity price, in line with our stockholders, but limits the exposure with significant changes in commodity prices.  In 2023, the collar for commodity prices ranged from $37.65 per Boe to $54.56 per Boe.  Actual realizations of $42.58 per Boe were within the range of the collar for 2023, thus no adjustment to price per Boe was necessary for determining adjusted EBITDA margin and FCF per share.\nBased on final financial results, TPL exceeded the Target level on both of the financial metrics, earning 169% of target on the Adjusted EBITDA metric and 150% of target on the FCF metric.\nThe Compensation Committee also approved strategic objectives for the year which were intended to encourage our management team to take action to improve TPL’s long-term opportunities for success, but which didn’t directly impact financial results in 2023.  The material aspects of the objectives are outlined below.\nGiven the strong results relative to the Strategic Objectives, the Committee scored the Strategic Objectives at 125% of target.\nAs a result of the combined weighted results for Adjusted EBITDA Margin, FCF per share and Strategic Objectives, our Named Executive Officers earned 151.1% of the targeted 2023 Short Term Incentive Program, as outlined below:\n48\n2023\nLong-Term Incentive Program\nAs part of the program redesign in 2022, the Compensation Committee implemented a long-term incentive plan for key employees at TPL, including Named Executive Officers.  The goals of the long-term incentive plan include:\n•\nAlign executives’ financial interests with stockholders.\n•\nTie executive compensation with long-term performance.\n•\nCreate a retention incentive through a substantial forfeitable balance with long-term vesting.\n•\nProvide a competitive compensation program aligned with typical company practices.\nTo meet the objectives of the program, the Committee established a long-term incentive program for the Named Executive Officers that uses a combination of Performance Share Units (PSUs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).  Each of the primary vehicles are summarized in the table below and described in more detail later in this section.\nPerformance Share Units (PSUs)\nPSUs comprise 50% of our Named Executive Officers long-term incentive compensation.  The PSUs create alignment between our executive officers and our long-term performance as measured by RTSR against a broad energy industry index (50% of PSUs) and the generation of Free Cash Flow per share over a 3 year period (50% of PSUs).  These awards vest, if at all, at the end of a three year performance period.\nThe RTSR PSUs are intended to measure the performance of TPL’s stock against a broad set of energy industry companies included in the XOP index.  Measuring RTSR against this group helps mitigate the impact of commodity price swings on the measurement of our performance.  While TPL does not have any direct peers, the broad XOP index comprises many of our customers and other companies that are similarly-impacted by commodity prices.\n49\nThe RTSR PSUs can be earned between 0% and 200% of the targeted number of shares based on our RTSR percentile ranking against the constituents of the XOP index as follows:\n(1)\nPayouts are interpolated between the points in the table.\nRTSR is measured using an average closing price at the beginning and end of the performance period.  In the case of the 2023 awards, the average closing price over the month of January 2026 will be compared against the average closing price over the month of January 2023 with the addition of reinvested dividends from February 1, 2023 to January 31, 2026.\nThe FCF PSUs measure our cumulative FCF/share against our initial targets over a three-year period.  If the Company is able to outperform and generate greater FCF, it will enable an increase in returns to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.  By measuring FCF on a per share basis, it requires our management team to ensure any dilution to our stockholders results in sufficiently greater FCF on an absolute basis.\nThe FCF PSUs can be earned between 0% and 200% of the targeted number of shares based on cumulative FCF per share as follows:\n(1)\nPayouts are interpolated between the points in the table.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs)\nRSUs comprise the other 50% of our Named Executive Officers’ long-term incentive compensation. Regular grants of RSUs are intended to help build an ownership stake in TPL, thereby aligning the executives with TPL stockholders.  The RSUs serve as a retention tool by creating a substantial forfeitable stake in the Company.  The RSUs vest based on continued service to TPL at a rate of 33%/year, beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date.\n2023 Long-Term Incentive Grants\nAt the beginning of 2023, the Committee established target long-term incentive grant levels for each of its Named Executive Officers based on a review of market data from the reference group and consideration of other factors such as experience and expertise, individual and company performance, and potential competitive opportunities for each of our Named Executive Officers.  The target long-term incentive grant levels were established as a percentage of salary and converted into a number of shares based on the stock price on the grant date of $1,923.78 per share (the closing price of our Common Stock on the date the awards were granted).\n50\nThe February 2023 awards are summarized in the table below:\n(1)\nThe Target LTI Dollar Amount does not match the accounting values in the Summary Compensation Table as the accounting value of the  RTSR PSUs reflects a Monte Carlo valuation.\nOther Compensation\nTPL’s Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the same benefit programs as are available to all TPL employees generally.  These include both a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a qualified defined contribution plan. These plans are designed to assist employees in planning for their retirement.  There are no supplemental non-qualified programs solely for the benefit of our executives.\nTPL also provides certain executive officers with minimal perquisites, including an automobile allowance.\nOther Governance Features\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nThe Company believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders for our Named Executive Officers and other executive officers to maintain a significant ownership position in TPL to create substantial alignment between our senior management and our stockholders.  Therefore, we have established stock ownership guidelines applicable to all of our executive officers.  The ownership guidelines require each of our executive officers to hold shares of Common Stock with an aggregate value of at least a specified multiple of base salary as follows:\n•\nCEO – 5x base salary\n•\nOther Named Executive Officers – 2x base salary\n•\nOther Executive Officers – 1x base salary\nShares counting towards the guideline include TPL shares held outright and unvested time-based restricted shares.  Performance shares do not count until earned.  Until and unless each officer has achieved the desired ownership level, he or she is required to retain at least 50% of the after-tax shares received upon vesting of equity awards.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company has entered into employment agreements with each Named Executive Officer following approval from the Compensation Committee.  These employment agreements provide for minimum levels of compensation and provide severance protections for the officer upon a termination of employment without Cause or for Good Reason (as defined in the agreements).  These agreements help match competitive practices and also include certain restrictive covenants which help protect the Company.  The provisions of these agreements are summarized under the “Employment Agreements” below.\nAccounting and Tax Considerations\nIn setting the components of our executive compensation program, the Committee considers the impact of the following tax and accounting provisions:\nCode Section 162(m).\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) generally disallows a tax deduction by public companies for compensation over $1 million paid individually to covered employees, as defined in the Code.  Tax deductibility is only one factor considered by the Committee in making compensation decisions that are in the best interest of TPL and our stockholders.\n51\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718, “Stock Compensation” (“ASC Topic 718”).\nASC Topic 718 requires a public company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity based on the grant date fair value of the award.  Our equity awards to the Named Executives Officers (and to our other employees) are structured to maintain the appropriate accounting treatment.\nCode Section 409A.\nSection 409A of the Code provides that deferrals of compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or arrangement are to be included in an individual’s current gross income to the extent that such deferrals are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and have not previously been included in the individual’s gross income, unless certain requirements are met.  We structure our stock plans, change of control agreements, severance plans and agreements and other incentive plans and agreements, each to the extent they are subject to Section 409A, to be in compliance with Section 409A.\nCode Sections 280G and 4999.\nThe change of control benefits in our Named Executive Officers’ employment agreements provide that, upon a change of control, we will either (i) reduce the amount of severance benefits otherwise payable to the executive officer so that such severance benefits will not be subject to excise tax for purposes of Code Sections 280G and 4999 or (ii) pay the full amount of severance benefits to the executive officer (but with no tax “gross-up”), whichever produces the better after-tax result for the executive officer (often referred to as the “best-of-net” approach).\nRisk Assessment\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed the relationship between our risk management policies and compensation policies and practices and concluded that we do not have any compensation policies or practices that expose us to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on TPL.\nOther Compensation-Related Policies\nWe have an Insider Trading Policy that sets forth terms, conditions, timing, limitations, and prohibitions with respect to trading in the Company’s securities.  The Insider Trading Policy also generally prohibits executive officers, among others, from hedging, including engaging in publicly-traded options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments relating to the Company’s securities, or selling the Company’s securities “short.”  The Insider Trading Policy also requires that such persons obtain pre-approval from the Company’s General Counsel for all pledges, and the deposit in margin accounts, of the Company’s securities.  The Insider Trading Policy is discussed further under “Insider Trading Policy; Anti-Hedging Policy” below.\nWe have a Clawback Policy that requires covered executives to reimburse the Company, or forfeit, any excess incentive compensation received by them during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any such financial reporting requirement.  The Clawback Policy is discussed further under “Matters Relating to Our Governance” above.\n52\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following table sets forth information concerning compensation for services in all capacities awarded to, earned by, or paid to, the Named Executive Officers:\n(1)\nRepresents the bonus amount approved by the Compensation Committee, with respect to all Named Executive Officers for 2021.  Bonuses for 2021 were accrued as of December 31, 2021 and were paid before March 15, 2022.  Mr. Steddum’s 2021 bonus amount includes a $50,000 promotion bonus that was paid during 2021.\n(2)\nAmounts reflect rounding up to full shares upon conversion of approved dollar-denominated awards.\n(3)\nAmounts consist of cash bonuses approved by the Compensation Committee, with respect to all Named Executive Officers for the respective year.  Bonuses were accrued as of December 31 of each respective year and paid and/or expected to be paid on or before March 15 of the following year.\n(4)\nRepresents the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the Named Executive Officer’s accumulated benefit under TPL’s pension plan over the prior year.  For further information regarding TPL’s pension plan, see Note 7, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  The reported amounts for 2023 reflect the aggregate change in the actuarial present value for accumulated benefits from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023.  For 2022, the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits decreased by $122,716 for Mr. Glover and decreased by $7,421 for Mr. Steddum, and as amounts are negative, are reported as zero in the table.\n(5)\nThe amount presented includes contributions by TPL to the account of the Named Executive Officer under the Company’s defined contribution retirement plan.\n(6)\nThe aggregate value of the perquisites and other personal benefits, if any, received by the Named Executive Officers for all years presented have not been reflected in the table because the amount was below the SEC’s $10,000 threshold for disclosure except for Mr. Glover, whose perquisites consisted of $14,400 in automobile allowance for 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n(7)\nMr. Steddum became Chief Financial Officer effective June 1, 2021.\n(8)\nMr. Dobbs joined TPL as Senior Vice President and General Counsel effective August 3, 2020. Mr. Dobbs became eligible for TPL’s defined benefit plan on January 1, 2022.\n53\nGrants of Plan Based Awards\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning equity awards granted to our Named Executive Officers during the Last Fiscal Year:\n(1)    These PSUs will vest three years after grant if certain performance metrics are met.  For further discussion of performance metrics, see Note 8, “Share-Based Compensation” in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n(2)    These RSUs will vest in one-third increments over a three-year period.  For further discussion, see Note 8, “Share-Based Compensation” in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n(3)    For RSUs and  FCF PSUs, grant date fair value is based upon the closing stock price on the grant date.  For RTSR PSUs, grant date fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model.  Grant date fair value reflected in the table is based upon target units for both FCF PSUs and RTSR PSUs.\n54\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning outstanding equity awards of our Named Executive Officers at the end of the Last Fiscal Year.  All outstanding stock awards reported in this table represent restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units that vest as described in the footnotes to the table.  At the end of the Last Fiscal Year, no options or stock appreciation rights awards have been granted under TPL’s long term incentive plan.\n(1)    Vesting of RSUs will occur as follows:\n(2)    The market value for RSUs is calculated based upon the closing price of our Common Stock of $1,572.45 per share as of December 31, 2023.\n(3)    The RTSR PSUs will vest three years after grant if certain performance metrics are met.  Numbers presented represent number of target units.  For further discussion of performance metrics, see ”2023 Compensation Program” above.  Fair value determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model updated as of December 31, 2023. The fair value as of  December 31, 2023 is $1,288.47 per share for RTSR PSUs granted on February 10, 2023 and $1,930.98 per share for RTSR PSUs granted on February 11, 2022.\n(4)    The FCF PSUs will vest three years after grant if certain performance metrics are met. For FCF PSUs granted on February 11, 2022, numbers presented represent maximum number of units based upon probability analysis as of December 31, 2023 that the maximum level will be achieved at the end of the three year measurement period.  For FCF PSUs granted on February 10, 2023, numbers presented represent target number of units based upon probability analysis as of December 31, 2023.  Fair value for FCF PSUs at December 31, 2023 is based on the closing stock price of $1,572.45 per share as of December 31, 2023.\n55\nThe following table presents information concerning the vesting of stock, consisting of shares of restricted stock, for our Named Executive Officers during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023:\nPay Ratio Disclosure\nFor purposes of calculating the 2023 ratio of the median annual total compensation of all employees to the total annual compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, TPL included base salary, annual bonus amounts, equity compensation, if any, and all other amounts deemed compensation in its calculation of annual total compensation.  We used December 31, 2023 as the measurement date.  Base salary amounts were annualized for any employee who had less than a full year of service during 2023.  Total compensation for Mr. Glover, the Chief Executive Officer, was determined to be $6,108,717 and was approximately 40 times the median annual compensation of all of our employees, excluding the Chief Executive Officer, of $152,405.  For purposes of this calculation, the Company had 99 employees, excluding the Chief Executive Officer.\nEmployment Agreements\nMr. Glover\nOn October 13, 2023, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Glover, its President and Chief Executive Officer (the “Glover Agreement”).  The Glover Agreement was effective as of October 13, 2023 and replaced and superseded the Company’s prior employment agreement with Mr. Glover that became effective on January 1, 2022 (“Prior Glover Agreement”) and before that, Mr. Glover’s earlier employment agreement with the Company (then the Trust) that was effective January 11, 2021 (“2021 Glover Agreement”).\nThe term of the Glover Agreement ends on December 31, 2026, with automatic one (1) year extensions unless notice not to renew is given at least 120 days prior to the relevant end date.\nUnder the Glover Agreement, Mr. Glover receives a base salary of $850,000 per annum, subject to annual review, and is eligible for an annual cash bonus (“Bonus”) of up to 110% of such base salary for achievement of specified performance targets.  Mr. Glover is also eligible to receive annual long-term incentive awards under the Company’s 2021 Incentive Plan (“LTI Awards”) as determined by the Company, the target amount of which, when added to Mr. Glover’s target Bonus for the year, will be at least 300% of his base salary for the relevant year.  Prior to the effective date of the Glover Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Prior Glover Agreement and the 2021 Glover Agreement, Mr. Glover’s base salary, Bonus and LTI Award amounts were as follows:\n56\nThe Glover Agreement provides for payment of severance benefits if Mr. Glover’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Glover for good reason, provided that Mr. Glover executes a general waiver and release of claims and complies with the restrictive covenants described below. The severance benefits include (i) accrued but unpaid Bonuses, (ii) LTI Award benefits to the extent provided for pursuant to the underlying award and plan documents, (iii) a pro rata Bonus for the year of termination, (iv) monthly payments for up to 18 months of COBRA premiums for continued group health, dental and vision coverage for Mr. Glover and his dependents, and (v) an amount equal to two times the greater of (A) the average of his base salary and Bonus for the preceding three years, or (B) his base salary and target Bonus for the year of termination. If Mr. Glover’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause; or by Mr. Glover for good reason within 24 months following a change in control of the Company as defined in the Glover Agreement, then, in lieu of the amount specified in clause (v), Mr. Glover will be entitled to an amount (“CIC Severance Amount”) equal to 2.99 times the greater of (a) the average of his base salary and Bonus for the three years preceding the year in which the change in control occurs, and (b) his base salary and target Bonus for the year in which the change in control occurs, and in addition to the foregoing, Mr. Glover shall also be entitled to (x) a payment equal to the value of his restrictive covenants, which payment shall offset an equal amount of the CIC Severance Amount; (y) 12 months of outplacement services paid for by the Company (not to exceed $30,000); and (z) 12 months of financial planning services paid for by the Company (not to exceed $30,000).

Mr. Glover will also be entitled to payment of accrued but unpaid salary, accrued but unused vacation, unsubsidized COBRA benefits, and unreimbursed business expenses, following termination of employment for any reason.\nThe Glover Agreement provides that Mr. Glover is entitled to participate in all benefit plans provided to the Company’s executives of like status from time to time in accordance with the applicable plan, policy or practices of the Company. It also provides for four weeks of annual paid vacation, reimbursement of business expenses, and indemnification rights.\nThe Glover Agreement contains restrictive covenants prohibiting Mr. Glover from disclosing the Company’s confidential information at any time, from competing with the Company in specified counties where the Company does business during his employment, subject to certain exceptions, and for one year thereafter (or six months thereafter if he terminates his employment voluntarily without good reason), and from soliciting the Company’s clients, suppliers and business partners during his employment and for one year thereafter.\nMr. Steddum\nOn October 13, 2023, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Steddum, its Chief Financial Officer (the “Steddum Agreement”). The Steddum Agreement was effective as of October 13, 2023 and replaced and superseded the Company’s prior employment agreement with Mr. Steddum that became effective on January 1, 2022 (“Prior Steddum Agreement”) and before that, Mr. Steddum’s earlier employment agreement with the Company that was effective June 1, 2021 (“Second 2021 Steddum Agreement”), and before that, Mr. Steddum’s earlier employment agreement with the Company (then the Trust) that was effective January 11, 2021 (“First 2021 Steddum Agreement”). The term of the Steddum Agreement ends on December 31, 2026, with automatic one (1) year extensions unless notice not to renew is given at least 120 days prior to the relevant end date.\nUnder the Steddum Agreement, Mr. Steddum receives a base salary of $500,000 per annum, subject to annual review, and is eligible for an annual cash Bonus of up to 90% of such base salary for achievement of specified performance targets. Mr. Steddum is also eligible to receive annual LTI Awards as determined by the Company, the target amount of which, when added\n57\nto Mr. Steddum’s target Bonus for the year, will be at least 225% of his base salary for the relevant year. Prior to the effective date of the Steddum Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Prior Steddum Agreement, the First Steddum Agreement and the Second 2021 Steddum Agreements, Mr. Steddum’s base salary, Bonus and LTI Award amounts were as follows:\nThe Steddum Agreement provides for payment of severance benefits if Mr. Steddum’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Steddum for good reason, provided that Mr. Steddum executes a general waiver and release of claims and complies with the restrictive covenants described below.

If Mr. Steddum’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Steddum for good reason within 24 months following a change in control of the Company as defined in the Steddum Agreement, then, in lieu of the amount specified in clause (v), Mr. Steddum will be entitled to an amount (“CIC Severance Amount”) equal to 2.99 times the greater of (a) the average of his base salary and Bonus for the three years preceding the year in which the change in control occurs, and (b) his base salary and target Bonus for the year in which the change in control occurs, and in addition to the foregoing, Mr. Steddum shall also be entitled to (x) a payment equal to the value of his restrictive covenants, which payment shall offset an equal amount of the CIC Severance Amount; (y) 12 months of outplacement services paid for by the Company (not to exceed $30,000); and (z) 12 months of financial planning services paid for by the Company (not to exceed $30,000).

Mr. Steddum will also be entitled to payment of accrued but unpaid salary, accrued but unused vacation, unsubsidized COBRA benefits, and unreimbursed business expenses, following termination of employment for any reason.\nThe Steddum Agreement provides that Mr. Steddum is entitled to participate in all benefit plans provided to the Company’s executives of like status from time to time in accordance with the applicable plan, policy or practices of the Company.

The Dobbs Agreement was effective as of October 13, 2023 and replaced and superseded the Company’s prior employment agreement with Mr. Dobbs that became effective on January 1, 2022 (“Prior Dobbs Agreement”) and before that, Mr. Dobbs’ earlier employment agreement with the Company (then the Trust) that was effective January 11, 2021 (“2021 Dobbs Agreement”).\n58\nThe term of the Dobbs Agreement ends on December 31, 2026, with automatic one (1) year extensions unless notice not to renew is given at least 120 days prior to the relevant end date.\nUnder the Dobbs Agreement, Mr. Dobbs receives a base salary of $420,000 per annum, subject to annual review, and is eligible for an annual cash Bonus of up to 75% of such base salary for achievement of specified performance targets.  Mr. Dobbs is also eligible to receive annual LTI Awards as determined by the Company, the target amount of which, when added to Mr. Dobbs’s target Bonus for the year, will be at least 175% of his base salary for the relevant year.  Prior to the effective date of the Dobbs Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Prior Dobbs Agreement and the 2021 Dobbs Agreement, Mr. Dobbs’ base salary, Bonus and LTI Award amounts were as follows:\nThe Dobbs Agreement provides for payment of severance benefits if Mr. Dobbs’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Dobbs for good reason, provided that Mr. Dobbs executes a general waiver and release of claims and complies with the restrictive covenants described below.  The severance benefits include (i) accrued but unpaid Bonuses, (ii) LTI Award benefits to the extent provided for pursuant to the underlying award and plan documents, (iii) a pro rata Bonus for the year of termination, (iv) monthly payments for up to 18 months of COBRA premiums for continued group health, dental and vision coverage for Mr. Dobbs and his dependents, and (v) an amount equal to two times the greater of (A) the average of his base salary and Bonus for the preceding three years, or (B) his base salary and target Bonus for the year of termination.  If Mr. Dobbs’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Dobbs for good reason within 24 months following a change in control of the Company as defined in the Dobbs Agreement, then, in lieu of the amount specified in clause (v), Mr. Dobbs will be entitled to an amount (“CIC Severance Amount”) equal to 2.99 times the greater of (a) the average of his base salary and Bonus for the three years preceding the year in which the change in control occurs, and (b) his base salary and target Bonus for the year in which the change in control occurs, and in addition to the foregoing, Mr. Dobbs shall also be entitled to (x) a payment equal to the value of his restrictive covenants, which payment shall offset an equal amount of the CIC Severance Amount; (y) 12 months of outplacement services paid for by the Company (not to exceed $30,000); and (z) 12 months of financial planning services paid for by the Company (not to exceed $30,000).

The remuneration covered by the Plan is Salary.  The Plan provides a normal retirement benefit equal to 1.5% of a participant’s average Salary for the last five years prior to retirement for each year of Credited Service under the Plan.  Credited Service is earned from the participant’s date of membership in the Plan, which is generally not the participant’s date of hire by the Company.  For information concerning the valuation method and material assumptions used in quantifying the present value of the Named Executive Officers’ current accrued benefits, see Note 7, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” of the Notes to Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of this Report.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the annual accrued normal retirement benefits are estimated to be $49,170 for Mr. Glover, $15,881 for Mr. Steddum, and $9,250 for Mr. Dobbs.\nThe Plan provides for early retirement after 20 years of service with the Company.  Early retirement benefits are calculated in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit, but are reduced by 1/15 for each of the first five years and 1/30 for each of the next five years that benefits commence prior to normal retirement.  If benefits commence more than 10 years prior to normal retirement, the early retirement benefit payable at age 55 is reduced actuarially for the period prior to age 55.  None of the listed participants are currently eligible for early retirement benefits.\nDirectors’ Compensation\nAs discussed in Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance,” our Corporate Reorganization was completed on January 11, 2021 and included a change in our governance structure to the Board from our previous structure of being governed by Trustees.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning compensation paid to the Board during the year ended December 31, 2023:\n(1)    From time to time, the Board constitutes ad hoc committees and determines whether any, and if so how much, compensation is paid for such service.  Any such payments made to directors during the year ended December 31, 2023 are reflected in the “Fees Earned or Paid in Cash” column of the table above.\n(2)    Mr. Norris and Mr. Barry resigned from the Board effective November 10, 2023.\n(3)    Mr. Roosa and Ms. Woung-Chapman joined the Board effective November 10, 2023.\n60\nOn an annual basis, all non-employee directors receive a base retainer of $230,000, of which $105,000 is paid in cash and $125,000 is paid in shares of Common Stock unless otherwise determined by the Company, valued at the closing price of the Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of grant of January 1 of each year, and vesting on the first anniversary of grant for grants dated prior to October 31, 2023.  Commencing October 31, 2023, any shares granted to non-employee directors are immediately vested.  In addition, non-employee directors receive the following amounts for additional Board and committee service: $125,000 for Board Chair, $10,000 for committee service (per committee), $10,000 for Audit Committee chair, $5,000 for Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair, and $5,000 for Compensation Committee Chair.  Directors serving in multiple leadership roles receive incremental compensation for each role, including that committee chairs receive both the committee service fee plus the specified amount for chairing such committee.  Directors are not expected to receive additional compensation for attending regularly scheduled Board or committee meetings.  For less than full years of service, the compensation paid to the non-employee directors will be prorated based on the number of days of service.\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nThe Company believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders for our directors to maintain a significant ownership position in TPL to create substantial alignment with our stockholders.  Therefore, we have established stock ownership guidelines applicable to our non-employee directors.  The ownership guidelines require each of our non-employee directors to acquire, within five (5) years, and hold shares of Common Stock with an aggregate value of at least five (5) times the base cash retainer.  Shares counting towards the guidelines include TPL shares held outright and unvested time-based restricted shares.  However, non-employee directors are permitted to sell shares of Common Stock to facilitate tax obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted shares.  If a non-employee director falls below the applicable multiple due solely to a decline in the value of shares of Common Stock, such non-employee director will not be required to acquire additional shares to meet the applicable multiple.\nCompensation\nCommittee\nInterlocks\nand\nInsider\nParticipation\nOur Compensation Committee consists of Ms. Duganier, the chair, Gen. Cook, Mr. Kurz and Mr. Roosa.  None of Ms. Duganier, Gen. Cook,  Mr. Kurz and Mr. Roosa, the members of the Compensation Committee, was an officer or employee of TPL during the Last Fiscal Year or had any relationship requiring disclosure by the Company pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.  There are no interlocking relationships requiring disclosure by the Company pursuant to Item 407(e)(4)(iii) of Regulation S-K.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Item 11 with management and, based on such review and discussion, recommended that it be included in this Report.\nBarbara J. Duganier, Chair\nDonald G. Cook\nKarl F. Kurz\nRobert M. Roosa\n61"

Financial Statements.\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAll schedules have been omitted because the required information is contained in the consolidated financial statements or related notes, or is not applicable or immaterial.\n69\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Texas Pacific Land Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Texas Pacific Land Corporation (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccrual of Oil and Gas Royalties — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company records an accrual for oil and gas royalty revenues in accounts receivable and accrued receivables, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The accrual is necessary due to the time lag between the production of oil and gas and generation of the actual payment by operators, which is typically one to two months after the production of oil and gas. The determination of the oil and gas royalty accrual involves an analysis of historical production volumes, estimates of the timing of future payments, and recent market prices for oil and gas. The realized transaction prices for oil and gas royalty revenues are subject to national and international economic and political considerations and locational and contractual basis differences.\nGiven the significant judgment in determining future estimated payments based on estimated production volumes, payment timing, and realized prices for oil and gas products made by the Company, performing audit procedures to evaluate the Company’s estimate of accrued oil and gas royalties required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating audit evidence and an increased extent of effort.\nF-1\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s accrual of oil and gas royalties included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related the Company’s estimate of the accrual of revenues from oil and gas royalties\n•\nWe evaluated the method used by management to develop the estimate considering historical production, payments, and timing of payments\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s estimation process by performing a retrospective review of variances between accrued revenue estimates and subsequent receipts of payments of oil and gas royalties\n•\nWe tested the completeness and accuracy of historical production and payment data used in the estimating payments not yet received for production during the current period, and assessed the relevance of historical data to the current period estimate\n•\nWe assessed the estimate of realized prices for oil and gas royalties used in the accrual of oil and gas royalties based on market pricing data and historical price differentials\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nDallas, Texas\nFebruary 21, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2021.\nF-2\nItem 1.\nFinancial Statements\nTEXAS PACIFIC LAND CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED\nBALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-3\nTEXAS PACIFIC LAND CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED\nSTATEMENTS OF INCOME AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-4\nTEXAS PACIFIC LAND CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED\nSTATEMENTS OF EQUITY\n(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-5\nTEXAS PACIFIC LAND CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-6\nTEXAS PACIFIC LAND CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nOrganization and Description of Business Segments\nTexas Pacific Land Corporation (which, together with its subsidiaries as the context requires, may be referred to as “TPL”, the “Company”, “our”, “we” or “us”) is a Delaware corporation and one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with approximately\n868,000\nsurface acres of land in West Texas, principally concentrated in the Permian Basin.  Additionally, we own a 1/128th nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest (“NPRI”) under approximately\n85,000\nacres of land, a 1/16th NPRI under approximately\n371,000\nacres of land, and approximately\n4,000\nadditional net royalty acres (normalized to 1/8th) (“NRA”) for a collective total of approximately\n195,000\nNRA located in the western part of Texas.\nTPL’s income is derived primarily from oil, gas and produced water royalties, sales of water and land, easements, and commercial leases of the Company’s land.\nOn January 11, 2021, we completed our reorganization from a business trust, Texas Pacific Land Trust (the “Trust”), organized under a Declaration of Trust dated February 1, 1888 (the “Declaration of Trust”), into Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a corporation formed and existing under the laws of the state of Delaware (the “Corporate Reorganization”).\nWe operate our business in\ntwo\nsegments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations.  Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses.  The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives of TPL and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.\nSee Note 14, “Business Segment Reporting” for further information regarding our segments.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation and\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include our consolidated accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  In the event estimates and/or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.\nRevenue Recognition\nOil and\nGas\nRoyalties\nOil and gas royalties are received in connection with royalty interests owned by TPL.  Oil and gas royalties are reported net of production taxes and are recognized as revenue when crude oil and natural gas products are removed from the respective mineral reserve locations.  Oil and gas royalty payments are generally received one to two months after the crude oil and gas products are removed.  An accrual for amounts not received during the month crude oil and natural gas products are removed is included in accounts receivable and accrued receivables, net based on historical trends.\nThe oil and gas royalties which we receive are dependent upon the market prices for oil and gas, and locational and contractual price differences.  The market prices for oil and gas are subject to national and international economic and political conditions and subject to significant price fluctuations.\nTPL has analyzed public reports of drilling activities by the oil companies operating where we have an oil and gas royalty interest in an effort to identify unpaid royalties associated with royalty interests we own.  Rights to certain oil and gas royalties we believe to be due and payable may be subject to dispute with the oil company involved as a result of disagreements\nF-7\nwith respect to drilling and related engineering information.  Disputed oil and gas royalties are recorded when these contingencies are resolved.\nWater\nSales\nWater sales revenue encompasses sales of water to operators and other customers, royalties received related to areas of mutual interest (“AMI”), and royalties received pursuant to legacy agreements with operators.  In certain instances, we enter into agreements with third parties to provide various water services, including but not limited to, the purchase, sale or transfer of water within a specific geographic area, also known as an AMI. Our performance obligation is deemed satisfied upon the delivery of water at which point, revenue is recognized.  In instances where a third party other than the customer is involved in the sale and/or transport of water, such as a revenue share agreement, brokered water sale transaction or third party acquisition of water, the Company will either be acting as the principal or the agent in the water sales transaction.  If the Company is deemed to be acting as a principal, the associated revenues are reported on a gross basis in water sales revenue and the corresponding costs associated with the sale are reported as an operating expense in water service-related expenses in the consolidated income statement.  If the Company is deemed to be acting as an agent, principally in brokered water transactions, the associated water sales revenue is reported net of the corresponding costs associated with the sale and included in the water sales revenue line item on the consolidated income statement.\nPurchases of water from third parties, transfer costs and treatment expenses associated with water sales are included in water service-related expenses.\nProduced Water Royalties\nProduced water royalties represent revenue from the transfer and disposal of saltwater from producing oil and gas wells on our land.  Revenue is recognized when the water is transported across or injected into our land.\nEasements and\nOther Surface-Related Income\nEasement contracts represent contracts which permit companies to install pipelines, electric lines and other equipment on land owned by TPL.  When TPL receives a signed contract and payment, we make available the respective parcel of land to the grantee.  Easement income is recognized upon the execution of the easement agreement, or in the event of a renewal upon receipt of the renewal payment, as at that point in time, we have satisfied our performance obligation and the customer has right of use.\nLeases of our surface acreage include, but are not limited to, facility, roadway and surface leases with a typical lease term of\nten years\nand generally require fixed annual payments.  Lease cancellations are allowed under certain circumstances, but initial lease deposits are generally nonrefundable.  The initial lease deposits and annual payments are recorded as unearned revenue upon receipt and amortized over the life of the lease.  Advance lease payments are deferred and amortized over the appropriate accounting period.\nOther surface-related income includes revenue from permits, material sales, and renewable energy sources.  Revenue from permits is recognized upon execution of the contract and receipt of payment.  Revenue from material sales is recognized upon the removal of materials by the customer.  Revenue from renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, generally consist of leases, some of which may include a provision for future royalties once certain circumstances occur.  As discussed above, lease payments are recorded as unearned revenue and amortized over the life of the lease.  Royalties are recognized based upon actual production.\nLand\nSales and Exchanges\nWe consider purchasers of land to be our customers as land management, leasing and sales are normal operating activities for TPL.  Revenue is recognized on land sales when the performance obligation to the purchaser (customer) is complete.  Revenue from land exchanges is recognized based upon the estimated fair value of the consideration exchanged.\nF-8\nCash,\nCash\nEquivalents and Restricted Cash\nWe consider investments in bank deposits, money market funds, and highly-liquid cash investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\nReceivables\nReceivables consist primarily of royalty income due related to our oil, gas and produced water royalties and trade accounts receivable related to water and material sales.  An allowance is recorded for expected credit losses and is based upon our historical write-off experience, aging of trade accounts receivable and collectability patterns of our customers.\nThe allowance for expected credit loss was approximately $\n0.2\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAccrual of Oil and Gas Royalties\nThe Company accrues oil and gas royalties, which are included in accounts receivable and accrued receivables, net.  An accrual is necessary due to the time lag between the removal of crude oil and natural gas products from the respective mineral reserve locations and generation of the actual payment by operators.  The oil and gas royalty accrual is based upon historical production volumes, estimates of the timing of future payments and recent market prices for oil and gas.\nAccrued oil and gas royalties included in accounts receivable and accrued receivables, net totaled $\n52.2\nmillion and $\n50.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nReal Estate Acquired\nReal estate acquired is recorded at cost and carried at the lower of cost or market.  Valuations are periodically performed or obtained by management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Impairments, if any, are recorded by a charge to net income and a valuation allowance if the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.  Minimal real estate improvements are made to land.\nNo\nimpairments were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.  Costs associated with our development of infrastructure for sourcing and treating water are capitalized. We account for depreciation of property, plant and equipment on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nDepreciable lives by category are as follows:\nRoyalty Interests Acquired\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our royalty interests acquired, which are carried at the lower of cost or market.  Valuations are periodically performed or obtained by management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Impairments, if any, are recorded by a charge to net income and a reduction in the carrying value of our royalty interests if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.\nNo\nimpairments were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nF-9\nDepletion is recorded based upon a units of production basis.  Depletion expense was approximately $\n2.0\nmillion, $\n1.0\nmillion and $\n1.3\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nReal Estate and Royalty Interests Assigned Through the Declaration of Trust\nThe fair market value of the land and royalty interests that were assigned through the Declaration of Trust (referred to as “Assigned” land and royalty interests) was not determined in 1888 when the Trust was formed; therefore, no value is assigned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to the Assigned land and royalty interests.  Consequently, in the consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income, no allowance is made for depletion and no cost is deducted from the proceeds of sales of the Assigned land and royalty interests.  Even though the 1888 value of real properties cannot be precisely determined, it has been concluded that the effect of this matter can no longer be significant to our financial position or results of operations.  Minimal real estate improvements are made to land.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets include a saltwater disposal easement and acquired groundwater rights.  When the Company acquires intangible assets that are attached to real estate and/or other tangible assets, an allocation of the total purchase price, including any direct costs of the acquisition, is made at the date of acquisition based on the estimated relative fair values of the assets acquired.\nIntangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from\n15\nto\n20\nyears.  Intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  In such event, the fair value of the asset is determined using an undiscounted cash flow analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist.  If an impairment has occurred, a loss for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is recognized in the statement of income.\nLeases\nWe lease certain facilities under operating leases.  A determination of whether a contract contains a lease is made at the inception of the arrangement.  Our leased facilities include our administrative offices located in Dallas and Midland, Texas, as well as some modular buildings in our West Texas yards.\nOur leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease.  We reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy.  Therefore, substantially all of the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement.  Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment.  The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.\nFor real estate leases, we account for lease components and non-lease components (such as common area maintenance) as a single lease component.  Certain real estate leases require reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs.  Certain leases contain fixed lease payments for items such as common area maintenance and parking.  These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.  See Note 12, “Commitments” for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nF-10\nWhen tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.  The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.  Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.  Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.  The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.\nThe liability for unrecognized tax benefits is\nzero\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022.  We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company utilizes the closing stock price on the date of grant to determine the fair value of stock awards and service-vesting awards, which for the Company includes stock awards, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance stock units (“PSUs”) with a performance condition.  For PSUs with a market condition, grant date fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model.  Unvested awards are entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents which are accrued and distributed to award recipients at the time such awards vest.  Dividends are forfeitable if the related award is forfeited.  For RSAs, RSUs and PSUs with performance conditions, forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur.  For PSU awards with market conditions, forfeitures are only recognized if the award recipient does not render the required service during the measurement period.\nShare-based compensation expense for stock awards is recognized in the financial statements immediately on date of grant as there is no requisite service period.  Share-based compensation expense for RSUs and RSAs is recognized in the financial statements over the awards’ vesting periods using the graded-vesting method.  Share-based compensation expense for PSU awards with performance conditions is recognized ratably over the measurement period at such time as the awards are probable and estimable.  Share-based compensation expense for PSU awards with market conditions is recognized ratably over the measurement period whether the market condition is satisfied or not if the service for the award is rendered.  Share-based compensation is reported on the consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income as a component of salaries and related employee expenses for employee awards and in general and administrative expenses for director awards.\nNet\nIncome Per Share\nBasic income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus unvested  shares issued pursuant to our equity and deferred compensation plans.  See Note 11, “Earnings Per Share.”\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock purchases are accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired Common Stock is recorded as treasury stock.  The cost associated with issuance of treasury stock is based on the average cost of treasury stock as of the date of issuance.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting capital that, under GAAP, are excluded from net income.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nWe invest our cash and cash equivalents (which include U.S. Treasury bills, money market funds, and commercial paper with maturities of three months or less) among\ntwo\nmajor financial institutions in an attempt to minimize exposure to risk from any one of these entities.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents deposited in our financial institutions in excess of federally-insured levels.  We regularly monitor the financial condition of these financial institutions and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.\nF-11\nSignificant Customers\nThree customers represented, in the aggregate,\n42.5\n% of TPL’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.  Four customers represented, in the aggregate,\n51.8\n% of TPL’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.  Three customers represented, in the aggregate,\n41.0\n% of TPL’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nReclassifications\nCertain financial information on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and consolidated statement of income and total comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.  These revisions include a balance sheet reclassification of $\n454,000\nof other taxes payable previously included in accounts payable and accrued expenses to ad valorem and other taxes payable, an income statement reclassification of $\n120,000\nof property taxes previously included in general and administrative expenses to ad valorem and other taxes, an income statement reclassification of $\n55,000\nfrom land sales expenses to general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 and an income statement reclassification of $\n144,000\nof property taxes previously included in general and administrative expenses to ad valorem and other taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n3.\nReal Estate Activity\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, TPL owned the following land and real estate (in thousands, except number of acres):\n(1)\nReal estate assigned through the Declaration of Trust.\nThe Assigned land held by TPL was recorded with no value at the time of acquisition.  See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Real Estate and Royalty Interests Assigned Through the Declaration of Trust” for further information regarding the Assigned land.  Real estate acquired includes land parcels which have either been acquired through foreclosure or transactions with third parties.\nLand Sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold\n18,061\nacres of land in Texas for an aggregate sales price of $\n6.8\nmillion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold\n6,392\nacres of land in Texas for an aggregate sales price of $\n9.7\nmillion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold\n30\nacres of land in Texas for an aggregate sales price of approximately $\n0.7\nmillion.\nLand Acquisitions\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired\n12,141\nacres of land in Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $\n20.0\nmillion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired\n177\nacres of land in Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $\n0.6\nmillion.\nF-12\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired\n88\nacres of land in Texas for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $\n0.5\nmillion.\n4.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nDepreciation expense was $\n12.2\nmillion, $\n14.2\nmillion and $\n14.8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n5.\nOil and Gas Royalty Interests\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we owned the following oil and gas royalty interests (in thousands):\n(1)    Nonparticipating perpetual royalty interests in\n370,737\ngross royalty acres as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(2)    Nonparticipating perpetual royalty interests in\n84,934\ngross royalty acres as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(3)    Royalty interest in\n4,302\nand\n4,182\nnet royalty acres as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRoyalty Interests Assigned Through the Declaration of Trust\nThe fair market value of the Trust’s Assigned royalty interests was not determined in 1888 when the Trust was formed, and accordingly, these Assigned royalty interests were recorded with no value.  See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Real Estate and Royalty Interests Assigned Through the Declaration of Trust” for further information regarding the Assigned royalty interests.  The Assigned royalty interests include 1/16th and 1/128th royalty interests.\nRoyalty Interest Transactions\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired oil and gas royalty interests in\n119\nnet royalty acres (normalized to 1/8th) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $\n3.6\nmillion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired oil and gas royalty interests in\n92\nnet royalty acres (normalized to 1/8th) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $\n1.7\nmillion.\nThere were\nno\noil and gas royalty interest transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nF-13\n6.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets, net consisted of the following as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n(1)\nThe remaining weighted average amortization period for total intangible assets was\n18.8\nyears as of December 31, 2023.\nAcquisitions\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired a saltwater disposal easement and groundwater rights in separate transactions for an aggregate cost of approximately $\n21.4\nmillion.  We had no intangible assets as of December 31, 2022.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $\n0.4\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The estimated future annual amortization expense of intangible assets is $\n1.1\nmillion for each year of 2024 through 2028, and $\n15.5\nmillion thereafter.\n7.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nTPL has a defined contribution plan available to all eligible employees.  Qualifying participants may receive a matching contribution based on the amount participants contribute to the plan up to\n6\n% of their qualifying compensation.  TPL contributed approximately $\n0.8\nmillion, $\n0.7\nmillion and $\n0.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nTPL has a noncontributory pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) available to all eligible employees who have completed\none year\nof continuous service with TPL during which they completed at least\n1,000\nhours of service.  The Pension Plan provides for a normal retirement benefit at age 65.  Contributions to the Pension Plan reflect benefits accrued with respect to participants’ services to date, as well as the amount actuarially determined to pay lifetime benefits to participants and their beneficiaries upon retirement.\nF-14\nThe following table sets forth the Pension Plan’s changes in benefit obligation, changes in fair value of assets, and funded status as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 using a measurement date of December 31 (in thousands):\nThe projected Pension Plan benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023 was impacted by changes in assumptions used as of that date compared to assumptions used as of December 31, 2022.  These changes included a decrease in the discount rate from\n5.25\n% as of December 31, 2022 to\n5.00\n% as of December 31, 2023.  The effect of the assumption changes was an increase in the projected benefit obligation of approximately $\n0.6\nmillion.\nAmounts recognized in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consist of (in thousands):\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of the following as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nF-15\nNet periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 include the following components (in thousands):\nService cost, a component of net periodic benefit cost, is reflected in our consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income within salaries and related employee expenses.  The other components of net periodic benefit cost are included in\nother income, net\non the consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income.\nOther changes in Pension Plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nTPL reclassified less than $\n0.6\nmillion (net of income tax benefit of less than $\n0.2\nmillion) out of accumulated other comprehensive loss for net periodic benefit cost to other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2023, $\n0.4\nmillion (net of income tax benefit of less than $\n0.1\nmillion) for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $\n0.2\nmillion (net of income tax benefit of less than $\n0.1\nmillion) for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the projected benefit obligation in excess of Pension Plan assets and Pension Plan assets in excess of  accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nF-16\nThe following are weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and costs as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nThe expected return on Pension Plan assets assumption of\n7.0\n% was selected by TPL based on historical real rates of return for the current asset mix and an assumption with respect to future inflation.  The rate was determined based on a long-term allocation of about two-thirds fixed income and one-third equity securities; historical real rates of return of about\n2.5\n% and\n8.5\n% for fixed income and equity securities, respectively; and assuming a long-term inflation rate of\n2.5\n%.\nThe Pension Plan has a formal investment policy statement. The Pension Plan’s investment objective is balanced income, with a moderate risk tolerance.  This objective emphasizes current income through a\n30.0\n% to\n80.0\n% allocation to fixed income securities, complemented by a secondary consideration for capital appreciation through an equity allocation in the range of\n20.0\n% to\n60.0\n%.  Diversification is achieved through investment in equities and bonds.  The asset allocation is reviewed annually with respect to the target allocations and rebalancing adjustments and/or target allocation changes are made as appropriate.  Our current funding policy is to maintain the Pension Plan’s fully funded status on an ERISA minimum funding basis.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.  Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources.  Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.  The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs used in measuring fair value, as follows:\nLevel\n1 – Inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.  Since inputs are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, Level 1 inputs require the least judgment.\nLevel\n2 – Inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, or are observable either directly or indirectly.  Inputs are obtained from various sources including financial institutions and brokers.\nLevel\n3 – Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  The degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for fair value measurements categorized in Level 3.\nF-17\nThe fair values of the Pension Plan assets by major asset category as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows (in thousands):\nManagement intends to at least fund the minimum ERISA amount for 2024 and may make some discretionary contributions to the Pension Plan, the amounts of which have not yet been determined.\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid for the following ten-year period (in thousands):\n8.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants share-based compensation to employees under the Texas Pacific Land Corporation 2021 Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) and to its non-employee directors under the 2021 Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan (the “2021 Directors Plan”).  As of December 31, 2023, share-based compensation granted under the plans has included these award types: stock awards, RSAs, RSUs and PSUs.  Currently, all awards granted under the plans are entitled to receive dividends (which are accrued and distributed to award recipients upon vesting) or have dividend equivalent rights.  Dividends and dividend equivalent rights are subject to the same vesting conditions as the awards to which they relate and are forfeitable if the related awards are forfeited.  RSUs granted under the 2021 Plan vest in one-third increments and PSUs granted under the 2021 Plan cliff vest at the end of\nthree years\nif the performance metrics are achieved (as discussed further below).  RSAs granted under the 2021 Directors Plan vest on the first anniversary of the award.  Effective October 31, 2023, the 2021 Directors Plan was amended to eliminate vesting requirements on stock awards granted after October 31, 2023.\nF-18\nIncentive Plan for Employees\nThe maximum aggregate number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock that may be issued under the 2021 Plan is\n75,000\nshares, which may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares (if any), treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner.  As of December 31, 2023,\n55,089\nshares of Common Stock remained available under the 2021 Plan for future grants.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to RSAs and RSUs under the 2021 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(1)\nRSAs were granted on December 29, 2021:\n1,993\nshares vested on December 29, 2022,\n40\nshares were forfeited during 2023 and\n1,297\nshares vested on December 29, 2023.\n(2)\nRSUs vest in one-third increments over a\nthree-year\nperiod.\n(3)\nOf the\n3,161\nshares that vested during the year ended December 31, 2023,\n1,165\nshares were surrendered upon vesting by employees to the Company to settle tax withholding obligations.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to PSUs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(1)\nThe PSUs were granted on February 11, 2022 and include\n1,197\nRTSR (as defined below) PSUs (based on target) with a grant date fair value of $\n1,605\nper share and\n1,197\nFCF (as defined below) PSUs (based on target) with a grant date fair value of $\n1,105\nper share.  If the maximum performance potential metrics described in the PSU agreements are achieved, the actual number of units that will ultimately be awarded under the PSU agreements will exceed target units by\n100\n% (i.e., a collective\n2,394\nadditional units would be issued).\n(2)\nThe PSUs were granted on February 10, 2023 and include\n926\nRTSR PSUs (based on target) with a grant date fair value of $\n2,761\nper share and\n926\nFCF PSUs (based on target) with a grant date fair value of $\n1,924\nper share.  If the maximum performance potential metrics described in the PSU agreements are achieved, the actual number of units that will ultimately be awarded under the PSU agreements will exceed target units by\n100\n% (i.e., a collective\n1,852\nadditional units would be issued).\nF-19\nEach PSU has a value equal to\none\nshare of Common Stock.  The PSUs will vest\nthree years\nafter grant if certain performance metrics are met, as follows:\n50\n% of the PSUs may be earned based on the Company’s relative total stockholder return (“RTSR”) over the applicable\nthree-year\nmeasurement period compared to the SPDR\n®\nS&P\n®\nOil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (“XOP”) Index, and\n50\n% of the PSUs may be earned based on the cumulative free cash flow per share (“FCF”) over the\nthree-year\nvesting period.  As the RTSR PSU is a market-based award, its grant date fair value was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model to determine the expected potential ranking of the Company against the XOP Index, i.e., the probability of satisfying the market condition defined in the award.  Expected volatility in the model was estimated based on the volatility of historical stock prices over a period matching the expected term of the award.  The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury yield constant maturities for a term matching the expected term of the award.\nEquity Plan for Non-Employee Directors\nThe maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the 2021 Directors Plan is\n10,000\nshares, which may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares (if any), treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner.  As of December 31, 2023,\n8,793\nshares of Common Stock remained available under the 2021 Directors Plan for future grants.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to the RSAs under the 2021 Directors Plan for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(1)\nRSAs vest on the first anniversary of the grant date.\nAs noted above, there are no vesting requirements associated with stock awards granted under the 2021 Directors Plan effective for awards granted subsequent to October 31, 2023.\nIn November 2023, the Company granted a total of\n22\nshares of Common Stock to\ntwo\nnew members of the Company’s board of directors.\nThe grant date fair value was $\n1,641\nper share, the closing price of its Common Stock as of November 10, 2023.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes our share-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of income (in thousands):\n(1)\nThe Company recognized a tax benefit of $\n2.2\nmillion and $\n1.8\nmillion related to share-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nF-20\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $\n8.6\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under existing share-based plans expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.1\nyears.\n9.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net, includes interest earned on our cash balances, other employee pension costs, and other miscellaneous income (expense).  Miscellaneous income (expense) includes insurance proceeds and gains and losses on disposals of capital assets.\nOther income, net for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in thousands):\n(1)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, miscellaneous other income (expense), net includes $\n1.4\nmillion of interest and damages resulting from an arbitration settlement with an operator.  See Note 12, “Commitments” for further information regarding the arbitration.\n10.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision charged to operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in thousands):\nAlthough TPL was a trust until January 11, 2021, it was historically taxed as if it were a corporation for income tax purposes prior to its conversion to a corporation.\nF-21\nTotal income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 to income before Federal income taxes as a result of the following (in thousands):\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\nTPL is subject to taxation in the United States and Texas.  TPL is no longer subject to U.S. Federal income tax examination by tax authorities for tax years before 2020.\n11.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus unvested restricted stock and other unvested awards granted pursuant to our incentive and equity compensation plans.  The computation of diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if all outstanding awards under the incentive and equity compensation plans were converted into shares of Common Stock or resulted in the issuance of shares of Common Stock that would then share in the earnings of the Company.  The number of dilutive securities is computed using the treasury stock method.\nF-22\nThe following table sets forth the computation of EPS for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except number of shares and per share data):\nRestricted stock is included in the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, but omitted from the basic earnings per share calculation until such time as the shares of restricted stock vest.  Certain stock awards granted are not included in the dilutive securities in the table above as they are anti-dilutive for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n12.\nCommitments\nLitigation\nManagement is not aware of any legal, environmental or other commitments or contingencies that would have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity as of December 31, 2023.\nPrior to January 1, 2022, ad valorem taxes with respect to our historical royalty interests were paid directly by third parties pursuant to an existing arrangement.  Since the completion of our Corporate Reorganization, we have received notice from a third party that they no longer intend to pay the ad valorem taxes related to such historical royalty interests.  In order to protect the historical royalty interests from any potential tax liens for non-payment of ad valorem taxes, we have accrued and/or paid such ad valorem taxes since January 1, 2022.  While we intend to seek reimbursement from the third party for such taxes, we are unable to estimate the amount and/or likelihood of such reimbursement, and accordingly, no loss recovery receivable has been recorded as of December 31, 2023.\nOngoing Arbitration with an Operator\nAs part of an ongoing arbitration between TPL and an operator with respect to underpayment of oil and gas royalties resulting from improper deductions of post-production costs by the operator for production periods before and through June 2023, the operator has agreed to pay $\n10.1\nmillion to TPL, comprised of $\n8.7\nmillion of unpaid oil and gas royalties, $\n0.9\nmillion of interest and $\n0.5\nmillion of damages.\nThe full amount of $\n10.1\nmillion has been recorded as a receivable, $\n8.7\nmillion has been included in oil and gas royalty revenue and the remaining $\n1.4\nmillion has been recorded as other income\nin the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company received payment from the operator for the full amount in January 2024.\nLease Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recorded right-of-use assets of $\n1.9\nmillion and $\n2.5\nmillion, respectively, and lease liabilities for $\n2.0\nmillion and $\n2.8\nmillion, respectively, primarily related to operating leases in connection with our administrative offices located in Dallas and Midland, Texas.  The office lease agreements require monthly rent payments and expire in December 2025 and July 2027, respectively.  Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Operating lease cost for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n0.8\nmillion.\nF-23\nWhile certain of our lease agreements contain covenants governing the use of the leased assets or require us to maintain certain levels of insurance, none of our lease agreements include material financial covenants or limitations.  There are no residual value guarantees in our lease commitments.  The weighted-average lease term for our operating lease liabilities is approximately\n33\nmonths.  The weighted average discount rate of our operating leases is\n4.7\n%.\nFuture minimum lease payments were as follows as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nRent expense for these lease agreements amounted to approximately $\n0.8\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and  2021.\n13.\nEquity\nCorporate Reorganization\nOn January 11, 2021, TPL completed its Corporate Reorganization.  As part of the implementation of the Corporate Reorganization, prior to the market opening on January 11, 2021, the Trust distributed all of the shares of Common Stock of TPL Corporation to holders of Sub-shares of the Trust, on a pro rata,\none\n-for-one, basis in accordance with their interests in the Trust (the “Distribution”).  As a result of the Distribution, TPL Corporation is a corporation with its Common Stock listed under the symbol “TPL” on the New York Stock Exchange.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn November 1, 2022, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program, which became effective January 1, 2023, to purchase up to an aggregate of $\n250\nmillion of our outstanding Common Stock.\nThe Company repurchases stock under a repurchase program opportunistically with funds generated by cash from operations.  This repurchase program may be suspended from time to time, modified, extended or discontinued by the board of directors at any time.  Purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made through a combination of open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, privately negotiated transactions, and/or other transactions at the Company’s discretion, including under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan implemented by the Company, and will be subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased\n27,619\nshares of Common Stock totaling $\n42.4\nmillion for an average price per share of $\n1,536\n.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased\n48,959\nshares of Common Stock totaling $\n87.9\nmillion for an average price per share of $\n1,795\n.\nDividends\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we paid total cash dividends of $\n13.00\nper share of Common Stock.

Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses.  The segments enable the alignment of our strategies and objectives and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.  We eliminate any inter-segment revenues and expenses upon consolidation.\nThe Land and Resource Management segment encompasses the business of managing our approximately\n868,000\nsurface acres of land and our oil and gas royalty interests in West Texas, principally concentrated in the Permian Basin.  The revenue streams of this segment consist primarily of royalties from oil and gas, revenues from easements and commercial leases, and land and material sales.\nThe Water Services and Operations segment encompasses the business of providing a full-service water offering to operators in the Permian Basin.  The revenue streams of this segment primarily consist of revenue generated from sales of sourced and treated water as well as revenue from produced water royalties.\nThe following table presents s\negment financial results for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands):\nF-25\nThe following table presents total assets and property, plant and equipment, net by segment as of  December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n15.\nSubsequent Events\nWe evaluated events that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date these financial statements were issued, and the following events that met recognition or disclosure criteria were identified:\nDividends Declared\nOn February 13, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n3.50\nper share, payable on March 15, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2024.\n16.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)\nWe measure our share of oil and gas produced in barrels of oil equivalent (“Boe”).  One Boe equals one barrel of crude oil, condensate, NGLs (natural gas liquids) or approximately 6,000 cubic feet of gas.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, our share of oil and gas produced was approximately\n23.5\n,\n21.3\nand\n18.6\nthousand Boe per day, respectively.  Reserves related to our royalty interests are not presented because the information is unavailable.\nThere are a number of oil and gas wells that have been drilled but are not yet completed (“DUC”) where we have a royalty interest.  The number of DUC wells is determined using uniform drilling spacing units with pooled interests for all wells awaiting completion.  We have identified\n675\n,\n584\n, and\n452\nDUC wells subject to our royalty interest as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n*****\nF-26"
