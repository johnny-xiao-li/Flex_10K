    "text": "You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in our common stock.  These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Manufacturing and Operations\nMarket conditions, including volatile commodity prices, margins and demand for refined petroleum, petrochemical and plastics products, impact our earnings, financial condition and cash flows.\nSimilar to other companies in the industry in which we operate, our financial results are largely affected by the relationship, or margin, between the prices at which we sell refined petroleum, petrochemical and plastics products and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks used in manufacturing these products.  Historically, margins have been volatile, and we expect they will continue to be volatile in the future.\nThe cost of feedstocks and the prices at which we can ultimately sell our products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply and demand, which are subject to, among other things, production levels, levels of refined petroleum product inventories, productivity and growth of economies, geopolitical risks, such as turmoil in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and other producing regions, technology advancements and the pace of the energy transition, weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes, consumer preferences and the use and availability of substitute products,\nand governmental regulation.  We do not produce crude oil and other feedstocks and must purchase all of the feedstocks we process.  The prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products can fluctuate based on global, regional and local market conditions, as well as by type and class of products, which can reduce margins and have a significant impact on our refining, wholesale marketing and retail operations, revenues, operating income and cash flows.  The ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls and changes in trade flows from events such as the Russia-Ukraine war have also had, and are likely to continue to have, a significant impact on the market prices of crude oil and certain of our products.\nAlso, crude oil supply contracts generally have market-based pricing provisions.  We normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined petroleum products.  We also purchase refined petroleum products produced by others for sale to our customers.  Changes in prices that occur between the time we purchase feedstocks or products and when we sell the refined petroleum products could have a significant effect on our financial results.\nThe price of natural gas and crude oil also influences prices for the petrochemical and plastics products we produce and the feedstocks used to manufacture those products.  Our Chemicals segment uses feedstocks that are derivatively produced in the processing of natural gas and refining of crude oil, and those feedstock prices can fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in worldwide energy prices and the supply and availability of the feedstocks.  Due to the highly competitive nature of most of the products sold by our Chemicals segment, market position cannot necessarily be protected by product differentiation or by passing on cost increases to customers.  As a result, price increases in raw materials may not correlate with changes in the prices at which petrochemical and plastics products are sold, thereby negatively affecting margins and the results of operations of our Chemicals segment.\nSustained or prolonged declines in commodity prices and margins for our products may adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, access to the capital markets, and our ability to fund our capital priorities, including share repurchases and dividends.\n21\nMarket conditions, including volatile commodity prices and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGL, impact the earnings, financial condition and cash flows of our Midstream business.\nOur Midstream business is affected by the price of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGL, which have historically been volatile.  The prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGL depend upon factors beyond our control, including global and local demand, production levels, imports and exports, seasonality and weather conditions, economic and political conditions domestically and internationally, and governmental regulations.  Decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity, production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves.  Sustained periods of low prices can also cause producers to significantly curtail or limit their oil and gas drilling operations, which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGL.\nThe volume of crude oil and refined petroleum products transported or stored in our pipelines and terminal facilities depends on the demand for and availability of crude oil and refined petroleum products in the areas serviced by our assets.  A period of sustained low demand or prices for crude oil could lead to a decline in drilling activity and production, which would lead to a decrease in the volumes of crude oil transported through our pipelines and terminal facilities, negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows.  Likewise, our earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted by a period of sustained lower demand for refined petroleum products, which could lead to lower refinery utilization and result in a decrease in the volumes of refined petroleum product transported through our pipelines and terminal facilities.\nThe natural gas gathered, processed, transported, sold and stored by us is delivered into pipelines for further delivery to end-users, including fractionation facilities.  Demand for these services may be substantially reduced due to lower rates of natural gas production as a result of declining commodity prices.  Commodity prices, including when ethane prices are low relative to natural gas prices, can also negatively impact throughput volumes of NGL transported, fractionated and stored.  Additionally, revenues and cash flows can increase or decrease as the price of natural gas and NGL fluctuates because of certain contractual arrangements whereby natural gas is purchased for an agreed percentage of proceeds from the sale of the residue gas and/or NGL resulting from its processing activities.\nIn order to maintain or increase throughput levels on our natural gas gathering and transportation pipeline systems and NGL pipelines and the asset utilization rates at our natural gas processing plants, we must continually obtain new supplies.  The level of successful drilling activity and prices of, and demand for, natural gas and crude oil, as well as producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits are some of the factors that may affect new supplies of natural gas and NGL.  If we are not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition, throughput on our pipelines and the utilization rates of our treating and processing facilities would decline.  This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and our ability to make cash distributions.\nOur operations are subject to planned and unplanned downtime, business interruptions, and operational hazards, any of which could adversely impact our ability to operate and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating results are largely dependent on the continued operation of facilities and assets owned and operated by us and our equity affiliates.  Interruptions may materially reduce productivity and thus, the profitability, of operations during and after downtime, including for planned turnarounds and scheduled maintenance activities.  In the past, we and certain of our equity affiliates also have temporarily shut down facilities due to the threat of severe weather, such as hurricanes.  Additionally, the availability of natural gas and electricity necessary to operate our assets can be affected by weather, pipeline interruptions, grid outages, and logistics disruptions, which may also cause us to temporarily curtail or shut down operations.\n22\nAlthough we take precautions to ensure and enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject to the hazards inherent in chemicals, refining and midstream businesses, such as explosions, fires, refinery, processing facility or pipeline releases or other incidents, power outages, labor disputes, global health crises, restrictive governmental regulation or other natural or man-made disasters, such as geopolitical conflicts and acts of terrorism, including cyber intrusion.  The inability to operate facilities or assets due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture, process, store or transport products.\nAny casualty occurrence involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us.  For assets located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater.  Damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial remediation fines or penalties by governmental authorities.  Should any of these risks materialize at any of our equity affiliates, it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the equity affiliate and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us.\nWe are subject to interruptions of supply and offtake, as well as increased costs, as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil, NGL and refined petroleum products.\nWe often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil, NGL and refined petroleum products to and from our facilities.  In addition to our own operational risks, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined petroleum products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined petroleum products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations, public health crises, armed hostilities, or third-party actions, including protests.  A prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil, NGL or refined petroleum products to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.\nWe conduct some of our operations, including parts of our Midstream, Refining and Marketing and Specialties (M&S) segments, and our entire Chemicals segment, through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture partners.  Our joint venture partners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or those of the joint venture, or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone.  Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.\nPublic health crises, epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business.  Any future widespread health crises could materially and adversely impact our business in the future.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19.  The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated containment efforts had a serious adverse impact on the economy and a material adverse effect on our business, as the demand for crude oil, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel and other refined products was significantly reduced.  We may be impacted again in the future depending on the duration and scope of any future health crises, epidemics, or pandemics.\n23\nEven if a virus or other illness does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may result in reduced demand for our products and materially affect our business.  As we cannot predict the duration or scope of any public health crisis, epidemic or pandemic, the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material.  Factors that will influence the impact on our business and operations include the duration and extent of such events, including the virulence of the infection, the timing of vaccine development and distribution across the world and its impact on economic recovery, the extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures, including travel restrictions, and their impact on our operations, and the general economic consequences of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo the extent any public health crisis, epidemic or pandemic adversely affected or affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks that could adversely affect our business described in this Annual Report, such as risks associated with industry capacity utilization, volatility in the price and availability of raw materials, supply chain interruptions, material adverse changes in customer relationships including any failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us, and risks associated with worldwide or regional economic conditions.\nCompetition Risks\nRefining and marketing competitors that produce their own feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage.\nThe refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets.  We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined petroleum products.  We do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks.  Some of our competitors, however, obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have.  Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand-name recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.\nSome of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have.  Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all aspects of our business.  In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual customers.\nVolatility in market demand for our petrochemical and plastics products and midstream transportation services and the risk of overbuild in these industries could negatively impact the results of operations of our businesses.\nWe and our equity affiliates have made and continue to make significant investments to meet market demand for our products and services, such as investments in midstream infrastructure and construction of new petrochemicals facilities.   Similar investments have been made, and additional investments may be made in the future, by us, our competitors or by new entrants to the markets and industries we serve.  The success of these investments largely depends on the realization of anticipated market demand, and these projects typically require significant development periods, during which time demand for our products or services may change, or additional investments by competitors may be made that could result in an overbuild of supply.  Any of these or other competitive forces could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our return on capital employed.\n24\nStrategic Performance and Future Growth Risks\nLarge capital-intensive projects can take many years to complete, and the political and regulatory environments or market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting expected project returns.\nOur basis for approving large-scale capital-intensive projects, such as the conversion of our San Francisco refinery into a renewable fuels facility, is the expectation that it will deliver an acceptable rate of return on the capital invested.  We base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions including the regulatory and operating environment.  Most large-scale projects take several years to complete.  During this multiyear period, the political and regulatory environments or other market conditions can change from those we anticipate, and these changes could be significant.  Supply chain disruptions may also delay projects or increase costs.  Accordingly, we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project, and this could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and our return on capital employed.\nPlans we or our joint ventures may have to expand or construct assets or develop new technologies, and plans for our future performance are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development, transportation and use of petroleum-based fuels.  Such risks could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nCertain of our plans are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable, and existing regulations will remain in place to allow for, the future development, transportation and use of petroleum-based fuels.  A portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our and our joint ventures’ ability to capture growth opportunities in the Midstream and Chemicals segments.  Regulatory policy decisions relating to the production, refining, transportation, marketing and use of petroleum-based fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups.  For example, the construction or expansion of pipelines can involve numerous regulatory, permitting, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  We may not be able to identify or execute growth projects, and those that are identified may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost, if at all.  In addition, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project.  Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs or the inability to complete growth projects could negatively impact our reputation, results of operations, cash flows and our return on capital employed.\nOur Energy Research & Innovation organization works to develop new technologies and solutions focused on advancing our business units, including renewable and sustainable fuels research.  Our efforts to research and develop new technologies is subject to a multitude of factors and conditions, many of which are out of our control.  Examples of such factors include evolving government regulation, the pace of changes in technology, the successful development and deployment of existing or new technologies and business solutions on a commercial scale, competition from third parties in developing new technologies and the availability, timing and cost of equipment.  The occurrence of these factors may delay or increase the cost of our efforts, which could negatively impact our reputation, results of operations, cash flows and our return on capital employed.\nPolitical and economic developments could affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.\nActions of federal, state, local and international governments through legislation or regulation, executive order, permit or other review of infrastructure or facility development, and commercial restrictions could delay projects, increase costs, limit development, or otherwise reduce our profitability both in the United States and abroad.  Any such actions may affect many aspects of our operations, including:\n•\nEstablishing maximum margins that can be earned on sales of motor fuels or imposing financial penalties on profits earned above established maximum margins.\n•\nLimiting or prohibiting our ability to undertake turnaround or other maintenance activities at our refineries.\n25\n•\nRequiring permits or other approvals that may impose unforeseen or unduly burdensome conditions or potentially cause delays in our operations.\n•\nFurther limiting or prohibiting construction or other activities in environmentally sensitive or other areas.\n•\nRequiring increased capital costs to construct, maintain or upgrade equipment, facilities or infrastructure.\n•\nRestricting the locations where we may construct facilities or requiring the relocation of facilities.\nFor example, in March 2023, the California legislature adopted Senate Bill No. 2 (such statute, together with any regulations contemplated or issued thereunder, SBx 1-2), which, among other things, (i) authorizes the establishment of a maximum gross gasoline refining margin (maximum margin) and the imposition of a financial penalty for profits above the maximum margin, (ii) significantly expands reporting obligations relating to the maintenance and business of our California refineries, which includes reporting requirements to the California Energy Commission (CEC) for all participants in the petroleum industry supply chain in California, (iii) creates the Division of Petroleum Market Oversight within the CEC to analyze the data provided under SBx 1-2, and (iv) authorizes the CEC to regulate the timing and other aspects of refinery turnaround and other maintenance activities in certain instances. The CEC is currently in rulemaking with respect to various aspects of SBx 1-2, and the potential implementation of a financial penalty or any restrictions or delays on our ability to undertake turnaround or other maintenance activities creates uncertainty due to the potential adverse effects on our refining, marketing and midstream operations in California, which may be material to our results of operations, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.\nWe anticipate that other jurisdictions may contemplate similarly focused legislation or actions.  The ultimate timing and impacts of SBx 1-2 and any other similarly focused legislation or actions are subject to considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors, including technological and economic feasibility, legal challenges, and potential changes in law, regulation, or policy, and it is not currently possible to predict the ultimate effects of these matters and developments, but they may be significant. For example, adverse effects on the financial performance of our operations in the state of California or the useful lives of the assets related to such operations may result in the recognition of material asset impairment charges and asset retirement obligations.\nFurthermore, the U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries and from doing business with entities affiliated with foreign governments, which can include state oil companies and U.S. subsidiaries of those companies.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security matters.  The effect of any such OFAC sanctions could disrupt transactions with or operations involving entities affiliated with sanctioned countries, and could limit our ability to obtain optimum crude slates and other refinery feedstocks and effectively distribute refined petroleum products.  We may face other regulatory changes in the U.S. including, but not limited to, the enactment of tax law changes that adversely affect our industry, new emissions standards, restrictive flaring regulations, and more stringent requirements for environmental impact studies and reviews.\nHostilities in the Middle East, Russia or elsewhere or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other countries.  Other political and economic risks include global health crises; financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations; short-term and long-term inflationary pressures; rising or prolonged periods of high interest rates; import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations; supply chain disruptions; civil unrest and other political risks; limitations in the availability of labor to develop, staff and manage operations; and potentially adverse tax developments.  If any of these events occur, our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n26\nWe may not be able to effectively identify, whether through acquisition, investment or development, lower-carbon opportunities on favorable terms, or at all, and failure to do so could limit our growth, our ability to participate in the energy transition, and our ability to meet our environmental goals and targets.\nPart of our strategy includes capturing growth opportunities in our Emerging Energy business to further advance our participation in the energy transition and meet our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets.  This strategy depends on our ability to successfully identify and evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities or develop and commercialize new technologies.  The number of lower-carbon opportunities may be limited, and we will compete with other energy companies for these limited opportunities, which could make them more expensive and the returns for our business less attractive and possibly cause us to refrain from making them at all.\nFurther, certain lower-carbon opportunities will depend on technological and other advancements that may not be within our control and may not come to fruition or be economically feasible in the near term.\nAny new opportunities also may depend on the viability of new assets or businesses that are contingent on public policy mechanisms including investment tax credits, subsidies, renewable portfolio standards and carbon trading plans.  These mechanisms have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable energy and other clean infrastructure technologies.  The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics and viability of lower-carbon and clean energy investments generally, as well as our participation in them.  If we are unable to identify and consummate acquisitions and investments, our ability to execute a portion of our growth strategy and meet our environmental goals may be impeded.\nRegulatory and Environmental, Climate and Weather Risks\nClimate change and severe weather may adversely affect our and our joint ventures’ facilities and ongoing operations.\nThe potential physical effects of climate change and severe weather, as well as other chronic physical effects such as water shortages and rising sea levels, on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present.  We have systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks, including those that may be caused by climate change, but such events could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.  Examples of potential physical risks include floods, hurricane-force winds, severe storms, droughts, heat waves, earthquakes, wildfires, freezing temperatures and snowstorms, as well as rising sea levels at our coastal facilities.  We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to protect our assets from physical risks and to employ processes, to the extent available, to mitigate such risks.\nWe operate facilities located in coastal regions of the United States, which have been impacted by hurricanes that have required us to temporarily, or even permanently, shut down operations at those sites.  CPChem also operates facilities on the Gulf Coast and has had to temporarily shut down sites in the past as a result of hurricanes.  Any extreme weather events or rising sea levels may disrupt the ability to operate our facilities located near coastal areas or to transport crude oil, refined petroleum or petrochemical and plastics products in these areas.  Extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We could also incur substantial costs to prevent or repair damage to these facilities.  Finally, depending on the severity and duration of any extreme weather events or climate conditions, our operations may need to be modified and material costs incurred, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are certain environmental hazards and risks inherent in our operations that could adversely affect those operations and our financial results.\nThe operation of refineries, power plants, fractionators, pipelines, terminals, gas processing facilities and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills, discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances.  If any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries, pipelines or refined petroleum products terminals, or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal, other than events for which we are indemnified, we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal, state, local and international environmental laws or at common law, and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills.\n27\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.\nOur business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.  These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:\n•\nThe discharge of pollutants into the environment.\n•\nEmissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, and GHG emissions, as they are, or may become, regulated.\n•\nThe quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into motor fuels.\n•\nThe handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.\n•\nThe dismantlement and abandonment of our facilities and restoration of our properties at the end of their useful lives.\nTo the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the refined petroleum products we produce.\nCurrently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address GHG and other emissions are in various phases of consideration, promulgation or implementation.  These include actions to develop international, federal, regional or statewide programs, which could require reductions in our GHG or other emissions, establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for our refined products.  Requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.\nFor example, in 2017, the California state legislature adopted Assembly Bill 398, which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40% reduction target for GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in Senate Bill 32.  Compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a market-based credit system.  Additionally, on August 25, 2022, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted regulations that effectively ban the in-state sales of new cars containing internal combustion engines beginning in 2035.  Also, on December 15, 2022, CARB adopted its “2022 Scoping Plan for Achieving Carbon Neutrality,” which purports to provide a road map for California to achieve carbon neutrality (which it defines as removing as many carbon emissions from the atmosphere as it emits) by year 2045.  Other states are proposing, or have already promulgated, low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.  If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers, sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase, we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits, or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFederal, regional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex, subject to change and impose considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility, legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy.  Increasing concerns about climate change and carbon intensity have also resulted in heightened societal awareness and a number of international and national measures to limit GHG emissions.  Additional stricter regulatory measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition.\n28\nInternational climate change-related efforts, such as the 2015 United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement, and the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations.  Although the United States had previously withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, it has since taken the steps necessary to rejoin, which was effective in February 2021.  The future of the U.S.’s climate change strategy and the impact to our industry and operations due to further GHG regulation is unknown at this time.\nIncreased regulation of the fossil fuel industry, particularly with respect to hydraulic fracturing, could result in reductions or delays in U.S. production of crude oil and natural gas, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nMost of the crude oil and natural gas production of our Midstream segment’s customers is being produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs.  These reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface.  Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production.  The EPA, as well as several state agencies, have commenced studies and/or convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities.  At the same time, certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation.  In addition, some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracturing in their communities.\nAlso, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict crude oil and natural gas development generally.  If ballot initiatives, local, state, or national restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of crude oil and natural gas, we may incur significant costs to comply with the requirements, and producers may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities.  Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments, limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  In addition to these proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments, municipalities, such as the City of Los Angeles, have already enacted or contemplate enacting complete or partial bans on oil and gas exploration and production activities.\nIf legislative and regulatory initiatives cause a material decrease in the drilling of new wells and related servicing activities, it may reduce crude oil, natural gas and NGL supplies, negatively affecting the volume of products available to our Midstream segment and increasing feedstock prices for our Chemicals and Refining segments, resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance with the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe EPA has implemented the RFS pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  The RFS program sets annual renewable volume obligation (RVO) requirements for the quantity of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the United States.  To provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry, a Renewable Identification Number (RIN) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in, or imported into, the United States.  As a producer of petroleum-based motor fuels, we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the EPA’s RVO requirements and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program.\nWe are exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs.  We cannot predict the future prices of RINs.  RINs prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including EPA regulations, the availability of RINs for purchase, and levels of transportation fuels produced, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.  If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase, if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs, if we purchase RINs that are ultimately determined to be invalid, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the EPA’s RVO requirements, including because the EPA mandates a blending quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel (a situation commonly referred to as “the blend wall”), our operations could be materially adversely impacted, up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel for sale in the United States.\n29\nSocietal, technological, political and scientific developments around emissions and fuel efficiency may decrease demand for traditional transportation fuels.\nDevelopments aimed at reducing GHG emissions may decrease the demand or increase the cost for our transportation fuels.  Societal attitudes toward these products and their relationship to the environment may significantly affect our effectiveness in marketing our products.  Government efforts to steer the public toward non-petroleum-based fuel dependent modes of transportation may foster a negative perception toward transportation fuels or increase costs of our products, thus affecting the public’s attitude toward our major products.  Advanced technology and increased use of vehicles that do not use petroleum-based transportation fuels or that are powered by hybrid engines would reduce demand for the motor fuel we produce.  We may also incur increased production costs, which we may not be able to pass along to our customers.\nAdditionally, renewable fuels, alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined petroleum products.  Tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined petroleum products than they otherwise might be, which may reduce refined petroleum product margins and hinder the ability of refined petroleum products to compete with renewable fuels.  The competition for renewable fuels feedstocks may also increase, negatively impacting the availability of such feedstocks or increasing their cost.\nThese developments could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nContinuing political and social concerns about climate change and other Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters may result in changes to our business and significant expenditures, including litigation-related expenses.\nIncreasing attention to global climate change has resulted in increased investor attention and an increased risk of public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Additionally, cities, counties, and other governmental entities in several states in the U.S. began filing lawsuits against energy companies in 2017, including Phillips 66, seeking damages allegedly associated with climate change, and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories.  Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions.  While we believe these lawsuits are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against them, the ultimate outcome and impact to us of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future.\nAdditionally, governments and private parties are also increasingly filing lawsuits or initiating regulatory action based on allegations that certain public statements regarding climate change and other ESG-related matters and practices by companies are false or misleading “greenwashing” that violate deceptive trade practices and consumer protection statutes.  Such claims are included in lawsuits filed against energy companies, including Phillips 66.  Such lawsuits present a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent to which energy companies face an increased risk of liability stemming from climate change or ESG disclosures and practices.\nEfforts have also been made by governments and private parties to shut down energy assets by challenging operating permits, the validity of easements or the compliance with easement conditions.  Lawsuits and/or regulatory proceedings or actions of this nature could result in interruptions to construction or operations of current or future projects, delays in completing those projects and/or increased project costs, all of which may have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nThese risks may result in unexpected costs, negative sentiments about our company, disruptions in our operations, increases to our operating expenses and reduced demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n30\nIncreased concerns regarding plastic waste in the environment, consumers selectively reducing their consumption of plastic products due to recycling concerns, or new or more restrictive regulations and rules related to plastic waste could reduce demand for CPChem’s plastic products and could negatively impact our equity interest.\nThere is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic, including microplastics, and other packaging waste in the environment.  Additionally, plastics have recently faced increased public backlash and scrutiny.  Policy measures to address this concern are being discussed or implemented by governments at all levels.  In addition, a host of single-use plastic bans and taxes have been passed by countries around the world and counties and municipalities throughout the U.S.  Increased regulation of, or prohibition on, the use of certain plastic products could reduce demand for certain of the products CPChem produces, which could negatively impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, thereby negatively impacting our equity earnings, and cash distributions that we receive, from CPChem.\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks\nCybersecurity incidents and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nOur information technology and infrastructure, or information technology and infrastructure of our third-party service providers (e.g., cloud-based service providers), may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors or breached due to human error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including ransomware and other malware, phishing and social engineering schemes, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other cybersecurity incidents.  Any such incidents could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.  Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in one or more of the following outcomes: (i) unauthorized access to or a loss or misuse of intellectual property, proprietary information, or employee, customer or vendor data; (ii) public disclosure of sensitive information; (iii) increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity events, such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants; (iv) systems interruption; (v) disruption of our business operations; (vi) remediation costs for repairs of system damage, or regulatory fines or penalties; (vii) reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence; (viii) exposure to legal liability; and (ix) damage to our competitiveness, stock price, and long-term stockholder value.  Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cybersecurity incident or the full extent of such incident.  Further, we have exposure to cybersecurity incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to our critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including cloud-based systems.  Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems or software can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to our IT systems that can materially impact our business.  Although we devote significant resources to prevent cybersecurity incidents and protect our system and data, we have experienced actual and attempted cybersecurity incidents, and while we do not believe that any of these incidents has had a material effect on our business, operations or financial condition, it is possible that a future incident may have such an effect.\nA cybersecurity incident may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders, employees, customers, vendors, and governmental authorities (U.S. and non-U.S.).  Our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans may not be able to prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  Furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention.  To the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.\n31\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy and cybersecurity issues and expanding laws could expose us to increased liability, subject us to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business.\nAlong with our own data and information collected in the normal course of our business, we and our partners collect and retain certain data that is subject to specific laws and regulations.  The transfer and use of this data both domestically and across international borders is becoming increasingly complex.  This data is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state, international, national, provincial and local levels in many areas of our business, including data privacy and security laws such as the European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) versions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\nThe GDPR applies to the transfer and processing of personal data of those who live in the EU or UK, respectively.  As interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to incur additional costs.  Failure to comply could result in significant penalties that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, gives California residents specific rights in relation to their personal information, requires that companies take certain actions, including notifications for security incidents and may apply to activities regarding personal information that is collected by us, directly or indirectly, from California residents.  As interpretation and enforcement of the CCPA evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows.\nComprehensive privacy laws with some similarities to the CCPA have been proposed or passed at the U.S. federal and state levels, such as the Colorado Privacy Act.  Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data as well as requiring disclosures about these practices.  Existing and potential future data privacy laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs.  Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us.  Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\n32\nIndebtedness, Capital Markets and Financial Risks\nUncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners.\nOur ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets, which is subject to factors beyond our control.  Our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, access to those markets, which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  In addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions.  Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity transaction counterparties, or our customers, preventing them from meeting their obligations to us.\nFrom time to time, our cash needs may exceed our available cash and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities.  From time to time, we may need to supplement cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities.  Uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities that are supported by a broad syndicate of financial institutions.  Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nNegative sentiment towards fossil fuels and increased attention to environmental and social matters, including climate change, could adversely affect our business, the market price for our common stock and our access to and cost of capital.\nThere have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities, and other groups, to promote the divestment of fossil fuel companies, as well as to pressure lenders, insurers, and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with fossil fuel companies.  If these or similar efforts are continued, our stock price, our ability to access capital markets or insure our operations, and our cost of capital may be negatively impacted.\nMembers of the investment community are also increasing their focus on environmental and social (E&S) matters, including practices related to GHG emissions, climate change, business resilience, diversity and inclusion, environmental justice and other E&S matters.  As a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our E&S disclosures and practices. Additionally, members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for E&S performance before investing in our stock or participating in our financing activities.  If we are unable to meet the E&S standards set by these investors, we may lose investors, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our access to capital markets and lenders may be curtailed, and our reputation may be negatively affected.\nOur efforts to accurately report on E&S-related issues expose us to operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks.  Standards for tracking and reporting on E&S-related matters, including climate-related matters, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve.  Processes and controls for reporting on E&S matters are subject to evolving and disparate standards of identification, measurement, and reporting on such metrics, including any climate change and E&S-related public company disclosure requirements adopted by the SEC, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current E&S practices and disclosures.\n33\nA failure to achieve our published GHG emissions intensity reduction goals and other E&S targets we may set in the future could negatively impact our business.\nWe have announced targets to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity from our operations by 30% and Scope 3 GHG emissions intensity of our energy products by 15% by 2030, and a target to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity by 50% by 2050, in each case as compared to baseline 2019 levels.  Our ability to achieve these goals depends on many factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as advancements that enable broad commercial deployment and use of lower-carbon technologies; global policies that fund and incentivize the development of a lower-carbon energy system; changes in consumer behavior and energy choices; the availability of materials throughout the supply chain; evolving regulatory requirements; competitor actions; the availability of renewable feedstocks; and acquisition and divestiture activities.  Further, the standards for tracking and reporting on GHG emissions have not been harmonized and continue to evolve.  Our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period.  In addition, our processes and controls may not always align with evolving voluntary standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting GHG emissions, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals.\nThe pursuit of these targets, and any other climate-related or E&S goals we may announce, may increase our costs, require us to purchase emissions credits or offsets, or limit or negatively impact our business plans.  Further, any failure or perceived failure to achieve such goals and targets within the timelines that we announce, or at all, could cause reputational harm, negatively impact our stock price and access to and cost of capital, and expose us to enforcement or litigation, among other negative impacts.\nWe do not fully insure against all potential losses, including those from extreme weather events, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected or underinsured liabilities and increased costs.\nWe maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent, including against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards.  We rely on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would result from uninsured or underinsured liabilities arising from operating hazards, including but not limited to, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations, including weather events, which could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDeterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money, limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit, and could trigger co-venturer rights under joint venture arrangements.\nOur credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant.  If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, and our funding sources could decrease.  This could require us to provide collateral, or other forms of security, which would increase our costs and restrict operational and financial flexibility.\nIn addition, a failure by Phillips 66 to maintain an investment grade rating could affect its business relationships with suppliers and operating partners.  For example, Phillips 66’s agreement with Chevron Corporation (Chevron) regarding CPChem permits Chevron to buy Phillips 66’s 50% interest in CPChem for fair market value if Phillips 66 experiences a change in control or if both Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. lower their credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter, with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks.  As a result of these factors, a downgrade of credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on Phillips 66’s future operations and financial position.\n34\nThe level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nAssumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us based on a variety of independent sources of market information and in consultation with outside actuaries.  If we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or health care cost trend rate, our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase.  In addition, several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use.  Funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations.  Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities.\nWe may incur losses as a result of our forward contracts and derivative transactions.\nWe currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to use them in the future.  If the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses.  Derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.  The risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment.  In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of ConocoPhillips following the separation.  Further, ConocoPhillips has indemnified us for certain matters, but may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us in the future.\nIn connection with our separation from ConocoPhillips in 2012, we entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement and certain other agreements pursuant to which ConocoPhillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify ConocoPhillips for certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide are not subject to any cap and may be significant.  Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ConocoPhillips has agreed to retain.  Further, the indemnity from ConocoPhillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and ConocoPhillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations.  Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n35"

    "text": "Management has implemented a comprehensive cybersecurity program that is designed to protect our information, and that of our customers and suppliers, against cybersecurity threats that may materially and adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information systems.  Our cybersecurity program includes processes and standards that leverage recognized cybersecurity frameworks, industry best practices and guidance from U.S. Government security directives that focus on cybersecurity and critical infrastructure.\nCybersecurity Governance\nBoard of Directors\nThe Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit and Finance Committee) is responsible for overseeing the company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, including oversight of the processes management has implemented to assess, identify and manage risks associated with cybersecurity and information technology.  In carrying out this responsibility, the Audit and Finance Committee regularly receives written reports from the company’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and periodic briefings from the CISO.  These presentations may address a wide range of topics, such as the results of recent vulnerability assessments and third-party independent reviews, changes to the threat environment, technological trends and other recent developments, and peer and other third-party benchmarking.  The Audit and Finance Committee makes regular reports to the Board of Directors on data protection and cybersecurity matters.  The company maintains an Enterprise Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan (ECIRP) which provides the framework for management’s response to cyber-related incidents and escalation protocols, including, when appropriate, prompt reporting to the Board of Directors.\nManagement\nAt the management level, our CISO has extensive cybersecurity knowledge and skills gained from work experience at the company and with a law enforcement agency, as well as from obtaining advanced professional certifications.  The CISO is responsible for the assessment and management of risks from cybersecurity threats and leads a team responsible for implementing, monitoring and maintaining cybersecurity and data protection practices across the company.  The individuals who report directly to our CISO possess relevant educational and industry experience in the areas of cyber threat hunting and intelligence, digital standards, data privacy, cyber training, and cybersecurity operations center management.  In addition to our internal cybersecurity capabilities, we also regularly engage consultants, or other third parties to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks.  The CISO receives reports on cybersecurity threats on an ongoing basis, and in conjunction with management, regularly reviews risk management measures implemented by the company to identify, assess and mitigate data protection and cybersecurity risks.  Our CISO works closely with the company’s Senior Counsel, Intellectual Property and Data Protection, to oversee compliance with legal, regulatory and contractual security requirements.\n36\nRisk Management and Strategy\nOn an annual basis, we conduct an evaluation of our cybersecurity risks as part of the ERM program.  Through the ERM program, the CISO and other internal subject matter experts review potential cybersecurity threat scenarios, such as data theft, cash theft, widespread outages and business disruptions, and the potential consequences of such scenarios.  The results of the risk assessment are shared with management and the Audit and Finance Committee.\nWe have a continuous monitoring program to detect and respond to potential cybersecurity threats in real-time.  Log data from our technical controls are collected, aggregated, and correlated in a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system that identifies and categorizes events, as well as analyzes them.  If the SIEM system identifies a potential security event, it can direct other controls to stop the activity and also generate alerts for detection and response.  These alerts are monitored by a managed security service provider that augments a dedicated internal Security Operations Center team.\nIn addition, we utilize a third-party risk management (TPRM) program to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with third-party relationships, including cybersecurity risks.  The TPRM program is designed to help ensure proper controls and measures are in place to manage the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with third parties.  Our policies and procedures aid in the governance from initial due diligence, selection, and contracting to termination.\nWith respect to cybersecurity incident response, our ECIRP provides a standardized framework for responding to cybersecurity incidents. The ECIRP sets out a coordinated approach to investigating, containing, documenting and mitigating incidents, including reporting findings and keeping senior management and other key stakeholders informed and involved as appropriate.\nInternal audit performs audits of our cybersecurity program.  Each year, we conduct audits across the company’s information technology and operation technology infrastructure, networks, systems, applications, and operational processes and procedures to evaluate compliance with our information security policies and standards.  Process control network assurance audits are conducted on a rotating schedule that is risk-based and provides coverage across each operational business area no greater than five years.  In addition to the internal audits, we also engage external cybersecurity experts and auditors to conduct assessments, penetration testing, and cybersecurity maturity assessments.  Although we have experienced actual and attempted cybersecurity events and incidents on our networks and systems in the past, we do not believe that the risks from any of these events or incidents, individually or in the aggregate, have materially affected our business, operations, or financial condition, or are reasonably likely to have such an effect.  For more information concerning cybersecurity risks we face, see the discussion in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report."

    "text": "From time to time, we may be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business.  Additionally, we have elected a $300,000 threshold to disclose certain proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental laws when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings.  The below matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement.  We do not currently believe that the eventual outcome of any matters previously reported, but still unresolved, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFurther, our U.S. refineries are implementing two separate consent decrees, regarding alleged violations of the Federal Clean Air Act, with the EPA, five states and one local air pollution agency.  Some of the requirements and limitations contained in the decrees provide for stipulated penalties for violations.  Stipulated penalties under the decrees are not automatic, but must be requested by one of the agency signatories.  As part of periodic reports under the decrees or other reports required by permits or regulations, we occasionally report matters that could be subject to a request for stipulated penalties.  If a specific request for stipulated penalties meeting the reporting threshold set forth in SEC rules is made pursuant to these decrees based on a given reported exceedance, we will separately report that matter and the amount of the proposed penalty.\n37\nWe received such a request in the first quarter of 2023, and we expect to receive a final demand for, alleged stipulated penalties arising from self-reported Clean Air Act violations at our Alliance, Borger, Sweeny and Wood River refineries. The proposed penalties exceed $500,000 and would be pursued pursuant to the consent decree referenced above and a related Wood River Refinery consent decree.  There have been no further developments with respect to this matter.\nNew Matters\nThe California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), served Phillips 66 Company (as successor to Tosco) and approximately 50 other potentially responsible parties with Imminent and Substantial Endangerment Determinations and Orders and Remedial Action Orders in November 2016 related to historic waste sent to certain California landfill sites that were operated by a now bankrupt party.  Since that time, we have been coordinating with other potentially responsible parties to negotiate a proposed settlement with DTSC regarding funding future operations, maintenance, and financial assurance for post-closure activities at the sites.  As part of the settlement process and Consent Decree in the matter, in December 2023 we agreed to pay approximately $4 million in full satisfaction of our potential liability at the Vine Hill landfill complex located in Martinez, California.  The company does not expect any future financial liabilities related to the Vine Hill landfill complex to be material.\nOn December 1, 2023, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) issued a demand for penalties that exceeds the $300,000 reporting threshold.  The penalty demand proposes to resolve seven Notices of Violation (NOVs) issued between 2020 and 2022 for alleged violations of air permit and air pollution regulatory requirements at the Los Angeles Refinery.  We are working with SCAQMD to negotiate and resolve these NOVs.\nMatters Previously Reported (unresolved or resolved since the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2023)\nIn 2018, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) issued a Compliance Advisory in relation to an improperly permitted facility flare and related air emissions from flare operations at one of DCP Operating Company LP’s (DCP Operating LP) gas processing plants, which DCP Operating LP self-disclosed to CDPHE in December 2017.  Following information exchanges and discussions with CDPHE, a resolution was proposed pursuant to which the plant’s air permit would be revised, and DCP Operating LP would be assessed an administrative penalty and economic benefit payment.  A revised air permit was issued in May 2019, but the parties had not yet entered into a final settlement agreement to complete the matter.  Subsequently, in July 2020, CDPHE issued a NOV in relation to amine treater emissions at this plant, which DCP Operating LP self-disclosed to CDPHE in April 2020.  Two additional and related NOVs were then issued in 2021 and 2023.  DCP Operating LP and the CDPHE have reached a tentative agreement to resolve these matters for aggregate monetary civil penalties of approximately $4 million.  As part of the settlement, DCP Operating LP will install emissions management equipment that will address the alleged violations.  A final order to resolve these matters is expected to be issued during the first quarter of 2024.\nSee “Dakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO)” section of Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables and Note 16—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding Legal Proceedings and other regulatory actions."

    "text": "Management’s Discussion and Analysis is the company’s analysis of its financial performance, financial condition, and significant trends that may affect future performance.  It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe term “earnings” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refers to net income attributable to Phillips 66.  The terms “results,” “before-tax income” or “before-tax loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) before income taxes.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nPhillips 66 is uniquely positioned as a diversified and integrated downstream energy company operating with Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, and Marketing and Specialties (M&S) segments.  At December 31, 2023, we had total assets of $75.5 billion.\nExecutive Overview\nDuring 2023, we reported earnings of $7 billion, generated $7 billion in cash from operating activities and received proceeds from debt offerings, net of debt repayments, of $2 billion.  We used available cash primarily to repurchase noncontrolling interests in DCP Midstream, LP (DCP LP) for $4.1 billion, fund capital expenditures and investments of $2.4 billion, repurchase shares of common stock for $4 billion and pay dividends on our common stock of $1.9 billion.  We ended 2023 with $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $6.4 billion of total committed capacity available under our credit facilities.\nStrategic Priorities Update\nIn November 2022, we announced financial and operational targets toward achieving the company’s strategic priorities and in October 2023, we announced updates to certain targets.  Our strategic priorities that are intended to enhance long-term shareholder value include:\n•\nDeliver Shareholder Returns –\nWe believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, a secure, competitive and growing dividend, complemented by share repurchases.  We increased our target for returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends from July 2022 through year-end 2024 to a range of $13 billion to $15 billion from a range of $10 billion to $12 billion.  In support of the increased target, our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization on October 25, 2023.   We plan to return at least 50% of net cash provided by operating activities to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  In 2023, we paid $4 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock and paid dividends on our common stock of $1.9 billion.  The amount and timing of future dividend payments and the level and timing of future share repurchases is subject to the discretion of, and approval by, our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors including our share price, results of operations, financial condition and cash required for future business plans.\nWe also plan to monetize certain assets that are no longer considered to be a long-term strategic fit.  We expect to generate proceeds of over $3 billion from the disposition of these non-core assets, which we plan to use to further advance our strategic priorities, including returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  The timing of these asset dispositions will be subject to satisfactory market conditions and any necessary regulatory approvals.\n•\nImprove Refining Performance –\nWe are focused on optimizing utilization rates and product yield at our refineries through reliable and safe operations, which will enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins.  We plan to enhance Refining segment returns and increase our utilization rates by focusing on low-capital, higher-return projects that increase asset reliability, improve market capture and reduce costs.  During 2023, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 92% and our worldwide refining clean product yield was 85%, compared to 90% and 84%, respectively, in 2022.\n42\n•\nCapture Value from Wellhead-to-Market –\nWe are focused on growing our fully integrated natural gas liquids (NGL) wellhead-to-market value chain within our Midstream segment.  As part of executing this strategy, we completed two transactions that increased our economic interest in DCP LP; the first in 2022, which increased our indirect economic interest to 43.3%, and the second in 2023, which increased our aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in DCP LP to 86.8%.  We have already captured operating and commercial synergies from these transactions and remain focused on capturing additional synergies as we complete our integration activities in 2024.  In 2024, we have budgeted $985 million of capital expenditures and investments in our Midstream segment, of which $593 million will be focused on enhancing our integrated NGL wellhead-to-market value chain.  In addition, growth capital includes $250 million related to the repayment of our 25% share of Dakota Access, LLC’s (Dakota Access) debt due in 2024.\n•\nExecute Business Transformation –\nWe continue to progress our multi-year business transformation aimed at sustainably reducing our cost structure.  We exceeded our savings target by achieving a run-rate cost reduction of $900 million per year and sustaining capital reduction of $300 million per year by the end of 2023.  As such, we are now targeting a run-rate cost reduction of $1.1 billion per year by the end of 2024, while maintaining our sustaining capital reduction of $300 million per year in 2024.\n•\nMaintain Financial Strength and Flexibility –\nDuring 2023, we successfully reduced our sustaining capital spend and used available cash and proceeds from debt offerings to increase our economic interest in DCP LP, repurchase shares of our common stock, pay dividends on our common stock, fund capital expenditures and investments and repay a portion of DCP LP’s debt.\n•\nDrive Disciplined Growth and Returns –\nA disciplined capital allocation process ensures we invest in projects that are expected to generate competitive returns.  Our strategy remains focused on investing growth capital in the Midstream and Chemicals segments.  We are also investing in capital-efficient renewable fuels projects to advance a lower-carbon future.  In 2024, we have budgeted $2.2 billion in capital expenditures and investments, which includes $1.3 billion of growth capital.\nDCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger (DCP Midstream Merger)\nOn August 17, 2022, we announced a realignment of our economic and governance interests in DCP LP and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC (Gray Oak Pipeline) resulting from the merger of DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream) and Gray Oak Holdings LLC (Gray Oak Holdings).  In connection with the DCP Midstream Merger, we were delegated DCP Midstream’s governance rights over DCP LP and its general partner entities, referred to as DCP Midstream Class A Segment, and our indirect economic interest in DCP LP increased to 43.3%.\nStarting on August 18, 2022, our financial results reflect the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, as well as DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Southern Hills).  Since the DCP Midstream Merger, we have taken steps to integrate the operations and personnel of DCP Midstream Class A Segment to enable the capture of commercial and operational synergies.\nDCP Midstream, LP Merger (DCP LP Merger)\nOn June 15, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all publicly held common units of DCP LP pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 5, 2023 (DCP LP Merger Agreement).  The DCP LP Merger Agreement was entered into with DCP LP, its subsidiaries and its general partner entities, pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries merged with and into DCP LP, with DCP LP surviving as a Delaware limited partnership.  Under the terms of the DCP LP Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the DCP LP Merger, each publicly held common unit representing a limited partner interest in DCP LP (other than the common units owned by DCP Midstream and its subsidiaries) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time was converted into the right to receive $41.75 per common unit in cash.  The DCP LP Merger increased our aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in DCP LP from 43.3% to 86.8%.\nSee Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the DCP Midstream and DCP LP Mergers.\n43\nBusiness Environment\nThe Midstream segment includes our Transportation and NGL businesses.  Our Transportation business contains fee-based operations not directly exposed to commodity price risk.  Our NGL business, including DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward, contains both fee-based operations and operations directly impacted by NGL and natural gas prices.  During 2023, NGL and natural gas prices decreased, compared with 2022, as the result of increased production.\nThe Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).  The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors.  Compared with 2022, the benchmark high-density polyethylene chain margin decreased in 2023, due to lower polyethylene sales prices as a result of industry oversupply driven by recent capacity additions.\nOur Refining segment results are driven by several factors, including market crack spreads, refinery throughput, feedstock costs, product yields, turnaround activity, and other operating costs.  Market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil.  The composite 3:2:1 market crack spread for our business decreased to an average of $28.37 per barrel during 2023, from an average of $34.26 per barrel in 2022.  The decrease in the composite market crack spread was primarily driven by lower global prices for gasoline and distillates reflecting reduced refining costs due to lower natural gas prices.  While the composite market crack spread fell in 2023, from the highest levels in at least a decade during 2022, it remains well above the five-year and 10-year average levels.  The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at Cushing, Oklahoma, decreased to an average of $77.69 per barrel during 2023, from an average of $94.44 per barrel in 2022.  The decrease in crude oil prices was primarily driven by increased production in the United States and other countries outside of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\nResults for our M&S segment depend largely on marketing fuel and lubricant margins and sales volumes of our refined petroleum products.  While marketing fuel and lubricant margins are primarily driven by market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are influenced by trends in spot prices, and where applicable, retail prices for refined petroleum products in the regions and countries where we operate.\n44\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur business segment and consolidated results reflect the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills, in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger, from August 18, 2022, forward.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the DCP Midstream Merger.\nConsolidated Results\nA summary of income before income taxes by business segment with a reconciliation to net income attributable to Phillips 66 follows:\n2023 vs. 2022\nNet income attributable to Phillips 66 for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $7,015 million, compared with $11,024 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.  The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to the recognition of an aggregate before-tax gain of $3,013 million in 2022 in our Midstream segment in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger and a decline in realized refining margins, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense and lower unrealized investment losses related to our investment in NOVONIX Limited (NOVONIX).\n2022 vs. 2021\nNet income attributable to Phillips 66 for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $11,024 million, compared with $1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.  The improvement was primarily due to higher realized refining margins, an aggregate before-tax gain of $3,013 million recognized in our Midstream segment in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger, lower impairments in the Refining segment, and improved international marketing fuel margins.  These improvements were partially offset by an increase in income tax expense, lower equity earnings from CPChem, and an unrealized decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX.\nSee the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results and Note 23—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on income taxes.  See also Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the DCP Midstream Merger.\n45\nStatement of Income Analysis\n2023 vs. 2022\nSales and other operating revenues\nand\npurchased crude oil and products\ndecreased 13% and 15%, respectively, in 2023.  These decreases were mainly due to lower prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates\ndecreased 32% in 2023, resulting from lower equity earnings from DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills, DCP Southern Hills and Gray Oak Pipeline due to the DCP Midstream Merger in August 2022, as well as decreased equity earnings from WRB Refining LP (WRB) and CPChem primarily due to lower margins, partially offset by lower operating costs.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the Chemicals segment analysis in the “Segment Results” section for additional information.\nNet gain on dispositions\nincreased $108 million in 2023, primarily due to a before-tax gain recognized in the Midstream segment in the third quarter of 2023 associated with the sale of our 25% ownership interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal.\nOther income\ndecreased $2,378 million in 2023, primarily due to an aggregate before-tax gain of $3,013 million recognized in our Midstream segment in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger in August 2022.  The decrease was partially offset by lower unrealized investment losses on our investment in NOVONIX in 2023 compared to 2022, and higher interest income.  See Note 4—Business Combinations, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the aggregate before-tax gain.  See Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our investment in NOVONIX.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nincreased 16% in 2023, mainly driven by the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills starting in August 2022 and higher costs associated with our business transformation.  These increases were partially offset by lower selling expenses due to decreased refined petroleum product prices.  See Note 31—Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding restructuring costs.\nDepreciation and amortization\nincreased 21% in 2023, primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization related to assets acquired as a result of consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Southern Hills and DCP Sand Hills starting in August 2022.\nTaxes other than income taxes\nincreased 33% in 2023, primarily due to consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills starting in August 2022 and an increase in environmental taxes.\nInterest and debt expense\nincreased 45% in 2023, primarily driven by higher interest expense as a result of consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment, new debt issuances in 2023 related to the DCP LP Merger, and a $53 million before-tax loss on the early redemption of DCP LP’s 5.850% junior subordinated notes.\nIncome tax expense\ndecreased 31% in 2023, primarily due to lower income before income taxes.  See Note 23—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\ndecreased 39% in 2023.  The decrease reflects the impacts of the DCP LP Merger in June 2023, and the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills and the derecognition of a noncontrolling interest related to Gray Oak Holdings as a result of the DCP Midstream Merger in August 2022.  The decrease also reflects the impact of the merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners in March 2022.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, and Note 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the DCP Midstream Merger and the Phillips 66 Partners merger, respectively.\n46\n2022 vs. 2021\nSales and other operating revenues\nand\npurchased crude oil and products\nincreased 52% and 47%, respectively, in 2022.  These increases were mainly due to higher prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL.\nOther income\nincreased $2,283 million in 2022, primarily due to an aggregate before-tax gain of $3,013 million recognized in our Midstream segment in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger.  The impact of this gain was partially offset by an unrealized investment loss on our investment in NOVONIX, compared with an unrealized gain in 2021.  See Note 4—Business Combinations, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the aggregate before-tax gain.  See Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our investment in NOVONIX.\nOperating expenses\nincreased 19% in 2022, mainly attributable to higher utility costs driven by increased natural gas and power prices and higher turnaround and other maintenance expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nincreased 24% in 2022, primarily driven by higher employee-related expenses, restructuring costs related to our business transformation and increased selling expenses driven by rising refined petroleum product prices.\nImpairments\ndecreased 96% in 2022, primarily due to a before-tax impairment of $1,298 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our Alliance Refinery.  See Note 11—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\nTaxes other than income taxes\nincreased 29% in 2022, primarily due to tax credits received from renewable diesel blending activity at our San Francisco Refinery in the third quarter of 2021, as well as higher property and other taxes.\nIncome tax expense\nincreased $3,102 million in 2022 primarily due to improved results.  See Note 23—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\nincreased 32% in 2022.  The increase was primarily driven by the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills as part of the DCP Midstream Merger in August 2022, which resulted in us reflecting the additional noncontrolling interests owned by the public common and preferred unitholders of DCP LP, as well as Enbridge’s noncontrolling interest in DCP Midstream Class A Segment, on our consolidated statement of income.  The increase was partially offset by a decrease due to the merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners in March 2022 that resulted in Phillips 66 Partners becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, and Note 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the DCP Midstream Merger and the Phillips 66 Partners merger, respectively.\n47\nSegment Results\nMidstream\n* Pipelines represent the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed consolidated pipeline segment, excluding NGL pipelines.\n*\n* Includes 100% of DCP Midstream Class A Segment’s volumes from August 18, 2022, forward.\n*** Includes 100% of DCP Midstream Class A Segment’s volumes.\n* Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu market hub, which are weighted by NGL component mix.\nThe Midstream segment provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation, terminaling and processing services; NGL production, transportation, storage, fractionation, processing and marketing services; natural gas gathering, compressing, treating, processing, storage, transportation and marketing services; and condensate recovery.  These activities are mainly in the United States.  This segment also includes our investment in NOVONIX.\nIn connection with the DCP Midstream Merger, the results of our Transportation business reflect a decrease in our indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline to 6.5% from August 18, 2022, forward.  Prior to August 18, 2022, the Transportation results presented in the table above reflect Gray Oak Holdings’ 65% economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline.  In addition, the results of our NGL and Other business include the consolidated results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward.  Prior to August 18, 2022, our investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills were accounted for using the equity method and equity earnings from these investments are included in the results of our NGL and Other business.\nIn the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, for additional information regarding the DCP Midstream Merger.\n48\n2023 vs. 2022\nResults from our Midstream segment decreased $1,960 million in 2023, compared with 2022.\nResults from our Transportation business increased $134 million in 2023, compared with 2022.  The increase in 2023 was primarily due to higher volumes and tariffs, as well as decreased operating costs, partially offset by lower before-tax gains on sales and transfers of interests in equity affiliates.  In August 2023, we recognized a $101 million before-tax gain on the sale of our 25% ownership interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal, while in August 2022, we recognized a before-tax gain of $182 million related to the transfer of an indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline as part of the DCP Midstream Merger.\nResults from our NGL and Other business decreased $2,497 million in 2023, compared with 2022.  The decrease was primarily due to an aggregate before-tax gain of $2,831 million recognized in the third quarter of 2022 from remeasuring our previously held equity investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills to their fair values in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger.  The decrease was partially offset by the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward, as well as increased fractionation volumes at the Sweeny Hub reflecting the startup of Frac 4 in October 2022.\nThe fair value of our investment in NOVONIX declined by $39 million in 2023, compared with a decline of $442 million in 2022.\nIn the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional information on our investment in NOVONIX and the before-tax gain on the sale of our 25% ownership interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal in August 2023.  See also Note 4—Business Combinations, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the before-tax gains recorded in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger.\nSee the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting 2023 results.\n2022 vs. 2021\nMidstream’s results increased $3,234 million in 2022, compared with 2021.\nResults from our Transportation business increased $498 million in 2022, compared with 2021.  The increase was primarily due to a before-tax impairment of $198 million recorded in the first quarter of 2021 related to Phillips 66 Partners’ decision to exit the Liberty Pipeline project, a before-tax gain of $182 million from the transfer of a 35.75% indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline to our co-venturer as part of the DCP Midstream Merger, and lower depreciation and amortization expense from logistic assets that were retired in the fourth quarter of 2021 as part of the planned conversion of the Alliance Refinery to a terminal.\nResults from our NGL and Other business increased $3,548 million in 2022, compared with 2021.  The increase was primarily due to before-tax gains totaling $2,831 million recognized from remeasuring our previously held equity investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills to their fair values in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger.  Additionally, the increased results reflect the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward, as well as improved Sweeny Hub results.\nIn 2022, the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX decreased by $442 million compared with an increase of $370 million in 2021.  We acquired this investment in September 2021.\nSee Note 11—Impairments, and Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on impairments and our investment in NOVONIX, respectively.  See Note 4—Business Combinations, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the before-tax gains recorded in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger.\n49\nChemicals\nThe Chemicals segment consists of our 50% interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method.  CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals.  These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals.  CPChem produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products.  Ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe.  CPChem manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene, as well as manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products.  Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50% interest in CPChem.\n2023 vs. 2022\nResults from the Chemicals segment decreased $256 million in 2023, compared with 2022.  The decrease was primarily due to lower margins driven by decreased sales prices, partially offset by lower utility costs due to a decline in natural gas prices.\nSee the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting CPChem’s 2023 results.\n2022 vs. 2021\nResults from the Chemicals segment decreased $988 million in 2022, compared with 2021.  The decrease was primarily due to lower margins driven by decreased sales prices, higher feedstock and utility costs, as well as decreased results from CPChem’s equity affiliates.\n50\nRefining\n* See the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.\n51\nOur Refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, as well as renewable fuels.  This segment includes 12 refineries in the United States and Europe.  In the fourth quarter of 2021, we shut down our Alliance Refinery and converted it into a terminal.\n2023 vs. 2022\nResults from the Refining segment decreased $2,550 million in 2023, compared with 2022.  The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins, partially offset by lower utility costs.  The decrease in realized margins was primarily driven by a decline in market crack spreads, partially offset by increased feedstock advantage and improved crude optimization benefits.\nOur worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 92% and 90% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.  See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results.\n52\n2022 vs. 2021\nResults from the Refining segment increased $10,169 million in 2022, compared with 2021.  The improved results were primarily due to higher realized refining margins driven by improved market crack spreads, partially offset by higher operating costs.  In addition, 2021 included a before-tax impairment of $1,288 million associated with our Alliance Refinery.  See Note 11—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding this impairment.\nOur worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90% and 84% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The increase in 2022 was primarily driven by improved demand for refined petroleum products due to supply constraints caused by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and easing of restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n53\nMarketing and Specialties\nThe M&S segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, as well as renewable fuels, mainly in the United States and Europe.  In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of base oils and lubricants.\n2023 vs. 2022\nBefore-tax income from the M&S segment decreased $267 million in 2023, compared with 2022.  The decrease in 2023 was primarily driven by lower international realized marketing fuel margins and decreased equity earnings from affiliates, partially offset by higher U.S. realized marketing fuel margins.\nSee the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting 2023 results.\n2022 vs. 2021\nBefore-tax income from the M&S segment increased $679 million in 2022, compared with 2021.  The increase in 2022 was primarily driven by improved realized international marketing fuel margins and higher results from our specialty lubricants and other businesses.\n54\nCorporate and Other\nNet interest expense consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest.  Corporate overhead and other includes general and administrative expenses, technology costs, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, restructuring costs related to our business transformation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment.\n2023 vs. 2022\nNet interest expense increased $91 million in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily driven by higher interest expense as a result of consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment, new debt issuances in 2023 related to the DCP LP Merger and a $53 million before-tax loss on the early redemption of DCP LP’s 5.850% junior subordinated notes.  The increase in interest expense in 2023 was partially offset by increased interest income.  See Note 14—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding debt.\nCorporate overhead and other increased $46 million in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to higher costs related to our business transformation.  See Note 31—Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding restructuring costs.\n2022 vs. 2021\nNet interest expense decreased $46 million in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily driven by increased interest income, partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment from August 18, 2022, forward.  See Note 14—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding debt.\nCorporate overhead and other increased $241 million in 2022, compared with 2021.  The increase was primarily due to restructuring costs associated with our business transformation for consulting fees, severance and an impairment related to assets held for sale, as well as higher employee related expenses.  See Note 28—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, and Note 31—Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding restructuring costs.\n55\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nFinancial Indicators\nTo meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we use a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities and debt financing.  During 2023, we generated $7 billion in cash from operations and received proceeds from debt offerings, net of debt repayments, of $2 billion.  We used available cash primarily to repurchase noncontrolling interests in DCP LP for $4.1 billion, repurchase shares of our common stock for $4 billion, fund capital expenditures and investments of $2.4 billion, and pay dividends on our common stock of $1.9 billion.  During 2023, cash and cash equivalents decreased $2.8 billion to $3.3 billion.\nSignificant Sources of Capital\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2023, cash generated by operating activities was $7 billion, a $3.8 billion decrease compared with 2022.  The decrease was primarily due to lower realized refining margins, working capital impacts, reduced operating distributions from equity affiliates, completion of long-term crude oil exchanges and higher contributions to our pension plans.\nDuring 2022, cash generated by operating activities was $10.8 billion, a $4.8 billion increase compared with 2021.  The increase was primarily due to higher earnings resulting from improved realized refining margins, partially offset by working capital impacts and lower operating distributions from equity affiliates.\nOur short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins.  Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control.  Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.\nThe level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows.  Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability, and weather conditions can affect output.  We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices.  Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 92%, 90% and 84% in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Our worldwide refining clean product yield was 85%, 84% and 83% in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEquity Affiliate Operating Distributions\nOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including CPChem.  Over the three years ended December 31, 2023, our operating cash flows included aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of $5.6 billion, including $2.2 billion from CPChem.  We cannot control the amount of future dividends from equity affiliates; therefore, future dividend payments by these equity affiliates are not assured.\n56\nTax Refunds\nWe received a U.S. federal income tax refund of $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2021.\nAsset Dispositions\nOn August 1, 2023, we sold our 25% ownership interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal for approximately $275 million.\nOn February 28, 2023, we closed on the sale of the Belle Chasse Terminal for approximately $76 million.\nDebt Issuances\nOn March 29, 2023, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of:\n•\n$750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% Senior Notes due December 2027 (2027 Notes).\n•\n$500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.300% Senior Notes due June 2033 (2033 Notes).\nThe 2027 Notes and 2033 Notes (collectively, the Notes) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66.  Interest on the 2027 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year and commenced on December 1, 2023.  Interest on the 2033 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 30 of each year and commenced on December 30, 2023.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn March 27, 2023, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, entered into a $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan agreement guaranteed by Phillips 66 (the Term Loan Agreement).  The Term Loan Agreement provides for a single borrowing during a 90-day period commencing on the closing date, which borrowing was contingent upon the completion of the DCP LP Merger.  The Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants similar to those contained in our revolving credit agreement, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  The Term Loan Agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts after grace periods; and violation of covenants.  We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.  Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at either: (a) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate plus the applicable margin, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement.  At December 31, 2023, $1.25 billion was borrowed under the Term Loan Agreement, which matures in June 2026.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the DCP LP Merger.\nRelated Party Advance Term Loan Agreements\nBorrowings under related party Advance Term Loan agreements with WRB increased from $25 million at December 31, 2022, to $290 million at December 31, 2023.  Borrowings under these agreements are due in 2035 and 2038 and bear interest at a floating rate based on the adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable margin, payable on the last day of each month.\n57\nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper\nPhillips 66 and Phillips 66 Company\nOn June 23, 2022, we entered into a $5 billion revolving credit facility (the Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor and a scheduled maturity date of June 22, 2027.  The Facility replaced our previous $5 billion revolving credit facility with Phillips 66 as the borrower and Phillips 66 Company as the guarantor.  The Facility contains usual and customary covenants that are similar to the previous revolving credit facility, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  We have the option to increase the overall capacity to $6 billion, subject to certain conditions.  We also have the option to extend the scheduled maturity of the Facility for up to two additional one-year terms, subject to, among other things, the consent of the lenders holding the majority of the commitments and of each lender extending its commitment.  Outstanding borrowings under the Facility bear interest at either (a) the adjusted term SOFR (as described in the Facility) in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate (as described in the Facility) plus the applicable margin.  The Facility also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees.  The pricing levels for the commitment fees and interest-rate margins are determined based on the ratings in effect for our senior unsecured long-term debt from time to time.  We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, no amount had been drawn under the Facility.\nPhillips 66 also has a $5 billion uncommitted commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by the Facility.  Commercial paper maturities are contractually limited to 365 days.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the program.\nPhillips 66 Partners\nIn connection with entering into the Facility, we terminated Phillips 66 Partners’ $750 million revolving credit facility.\nDCP Midstream Class A Segment\nDCP LP has a credit facility under its amended credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), with a borrowing capacity of up to $1.4 billion that matures on March 18, 2027.  The Credit Agreement grants DCP LP the option to increase the revolving loan commitment by an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million and to extend the term for up to two additional one-year periods, subject to requisite lender approval.  Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement bears interest at either: (a) an adjusted SOFR (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin; or (b) the base rate (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin.  The Credit Agreement also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees.  The cost of borrowing under the Credit Agreement is determined by a ratings-based pricing grid based on DCP LP’s credit rating.  At December 31, 2023, DCP LP had $25 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  At December 31, 2022, DCP LP had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  At December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, $2 million and $10 million in letters of credit had been issued that are supported by the Credit Agreement.\nDCP LP has an accounts receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility) that provides for up to $350 million of borrowing capacity through August 2024 at an adjusted SOFR and includes an uncommitted option to increase the total commitments under the Securitization Facility by up to an additional $400 million.  Under the Securitization Facility, certain of DCP LP’s wholly owned subsidiaries sell or contribute receivables to another of DCP LP’s consolidated subsidiaries, DCP Receivables LLC, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity created for the sole purpose of the Securitization Facility.  At December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, $350 million and $40 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Securitization Facility, which are secured by accounts receivable at DCP Receivables LLC.\nTotal Committed Capacity Available\nAt December 31, 2023, and 2022, we had approximately $6.4 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, of total committed capacity available under the credit facilities described above.\n58\nOther Debt Issuances and Financings\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nIn November 2021, Phillips 66 closed its public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.300% senior unsecured notes due 2052.  Interest on the Senior Notes due 2052 is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2022.  Proceeds received from the public offering were $982 million, net of underwriters’ discounts and commissions, as well as debt issuance costs.  In December 2021, Phillips 66 used the proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, to repay $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of its $2 billion 4.300% Senior Notes due April 2022.\nPhillips 66 Partners Term Loan\nIn April 2021, Phillips 66 Partners entered into a $450 million term loan agreement with a one-year term and borrowed the full amount.  The term loan agreement was repaid upon maturity in April 2022 without premium or penalty.\nPhillips 66 Availability of Debt Financing\nWe have an A3 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service and a BBB+ credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s.  These investment grade ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders.  We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a rating downgrade by one or both rating agencies.  Failure to maintain investment grade ratings could prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, although we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.\nDCP LP Availability of Debt Financing\nDCP LP has a BBB+ credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard and Poor’s and a Baa3 credit rating, with a positive outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service.  These ratings facilitate DCP LP’s access to a variety of lenders.  DCP LP does not have any ratings triggers on any of its corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact access to liquidity, in the event of a rating downgrade by one or more rating agencies.\n59\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLease Residual Value Guarantees\nUnder the operating lease agreement for our headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, we have the option, at the end of the lease term in September 2025, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale.  We have a residual value guarantee associated with the operating lease agreement with a maximum potential future exposure of $514 million at December 31, 2023.  We also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar, airplane and truck leases with maximum potential future exposures totaling $168 million.  These leases have remaining terms of one to ten years.\nDakota Access and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO)\nIn 2020, the trial court presiding over litigation brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (the Tribe) ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) addressing an easement under Lake Oahe in North Dakota.  The trial court later vacated the easement.  Although the easement is vacated, the USACE has no plans to stop pipeline operations while it proceeds with the EIS, and the Tribe’s request for a shutdown was denied in May 2021.  In June 2021, the trial court dismissed the litigation entirely. Once the EIS is completed, new litigation or challenges may be filed.\nIn February 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court (the Court) denied Dakota Access’ writ of certiorari requesting the Court to review the trial court’s decision to order the EIS and vacate the easement.  Therefore, the requirement to prepare the EIS stood.  Also in February 2022, the Tribe withdrew as a cooperating agency, causing the USACE to halt the EIS process while the USACE engaged with the Tribe on their reasons for withdrawing.\nThe draft EIS process resumed in August 2022, and in September 2023 the USACE published its draft EIS for public comment.  The USACE identified five potential outcomes, but did not indicate which one it preferred.  The options comprise two “no action” alternatives where the USACE would deny an easement to Dakota Access and require it to shut down the pipeline and either remove the pipe from under Lake Oahe or allow the pipeline to be abandoned-in-place under the lake.  The USACE also identified three “action” alternatives.  Two of them contemplate that the USACE would reissue the easement to Dakota Access under essentially the same terms as 2017 with either the same or a larger volume of oil allowed through the pipeline while the third alternative would require decommissioning the current pipeline and construction of a new line 39 miles upstream from the current location.  The USACE has not indicated when it will issue its final decision.\nDakota Access and ETCO have guaranteed repayment of senior unsecured notes issued by a wholly owned subsidiary of Dakota Access in March 2019.  On April 1, 2022, Dakota Access’ wholly owned subsidiary repaid $650 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior notes upon maturity.  We funded our 25% share, or $163 million, with a capital contribution of $89 million in March 2022 and $74 million of distributions we elected not to receive from Dakota Access in the first quarter of 2022.  At December 31, 2023, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of Dakota Access’ senior unsecured notes was $1.85 billion.\nIn conjunction with the notes offering, Phillips 66 Partners, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, and its co-venturers in Dakota Access also provided a Contingent Equity Contribution Undertaking (CECU).  Under the CECU, the co-venturers may be severally required to make proportionate equity contributions to Dakota Access if there is an unfavorable final judgment in the above-mentioned ongoing litigation.  At December 31, 2023, our 25% share of the maximum potential equity contributions under the CECU was approximately $467 million.\nIf the pipeline is required to cease operations, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  Should operations cease and Dakota Access and ETCO not have sufficient funds to pay its expenses, we also could be required to support our 25% share of the ongoing expenses, including scheduled interest payments on the notes of approximately $20 million annually, in addition to the potential obligations under the CECU at December 31, 2023.\nSee Note 15—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding guarantees.\n60\nCapital Requirements\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section below.\nDebt Financing\nOur debt balance at December 31, 2023, was $19.4 billion and our total debt-to-capital ratio was 38%.  See Note 14—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for our annual debt maturities over the next five years and more information on debt repayments.\n2023 Repayments\nOn May 19, 2023, DCP LP redeemed its 5.850% junior subordinated notes due May 2043 with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $550 million.\nOn March 15, 2023, DCP LP repaid its 3.875% senior unsecured notes due March 2023 with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million.\n2022 Repayments\nIn December 2022, Phillips 66 repaid its 3.700% senior notes due April 2023 with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million.\nAfter our consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment on August 17, 2022, DCP LP repaid $470 million of borrowings under its accounts receivable securitization and revolving credit facilities that were outstanding on the acquisition date.\nIn April 2022, upon maturity, Phillips 66 repaid its 4.300% senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion and Phillips 66 Partners repaid its $450 million term loan.\nSubsequent Repayment\nOn February 15, 2024, upon maturity, Phillips 66 repaid its 0.900% senior notes due February 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of $800 million.\nDebt Exchange\nOn May 5, 2022, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, completed offers to exchange (the Exchange Offers) all validly tendered notes of seven different series of notes issued by Phillips 66 Partners (collectively, the Old Notes), with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.5 billion, for notes issued by Phillips 66 Company (collectively, the New Notes).  The New Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66 and rank equally with Phillips 66 Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and the guarantees rank equally with Phillips 66’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.\nOld Notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.2 billion were tendered in the Exchange Offers.  The New Notes have the same interest rates, interest payment dates and maturity dates as the Old Notes.  Holders that validly tendered before the end of the early participation period on April 19, 2022 (the Early Participation Date), received New Notes with an aggregate principal amount equivalent to the Old Notes, while holders that validly tendered after the Early Participation Date, but before the Expiration Date, received New Notes with an aggregate principal amount 3% less than the Old Notes.  Substantially all of the Old Notes exchanged were tendered during the Early Participation Period.\nDCP Midstream Merger\nOn August 17, 2022, we and our co-venturer, Enbridge, agreed to merge DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings with DCP Midstream as the surviving entity.  As part of the DCP Midstream Merger, we made a net cash payment of $306 million.\n61\nDCP LP Merger\nOn June 15, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all publicly held common units of DCP LP pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 5, 2023 (DCP LP Merger Agreement).  The DCP LP Merger Agreement was entered into with DCP LP, its subsidiaries and its general partner entities, pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries merged with and into DCP LP, with DCP LP surviving as a Delaware limited partnership.  Under the terms of the DCP LP Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the DCP LP Merger, each publicly held common unit representing a limited partner interest in DCP LP (other than the common units owned by DCP Midstream and its subsidiaries) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time was converted into the right to receive $41.75 per common unit in cash.  The DCP LP Merger increased our aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in DCP LP from 43.3% to 86.8%.\nWe paid approximately $3.8 billion in cash consideration, funded with a combination of available cash and proceeds from the offering of the Notes and borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement.\nSee Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, Note 14—Debt, and Note 29—DCP Midstream Class A Segment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\nDCP LP Preferred Units\nOn October 16, 2023, DCP LP redeemed its Series C preferred units with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $110 million.\nOn June 15, 2023, DCP LP redeemed its Series B preferred units with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $161 million.\nIn December 2022, DCP LP redeemed its Series A preferred units with an aggregate liquidation preference of $500 million.\nDCP LP Cash Distributions to Unitholders\nDCP LP’s partnership agreement requires it to distribute all available cash within 45 days after the end of each quarter.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, DCP LP made cash distributions of $125 million to common unitholders other than Phillips 66 and its subsidiaries and $15 million to preferred unitholders.\nSee Note 29—DCP Midstream Class A Segment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the DCP LP public common unit acquisition and the redemptions of DCP LP’s Series B and Series C preferred units.\nMerger with Phillips 66 Partners\nOn March 9, 2022, we completed a merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners.  The merger resulted in the acquisition of all limited partnership interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us in exchange for 41.8 million shares of Phillips 66 common stock issued from treasury stock.  Phillips 66 Partners common unitholders received 0.50 shares of Phillips 66 common stock for each outstanding Phillips 66 Partners common unit.  Phillips 66 Partners’ perpetual convertible preferred units were converted into common units at a premium to the original issuance price prior to being exchanged for Phillips 66 common stock.  Upon closing, Phillips 66 Partners became a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 and its common units are no longer publicly traded.  See Note 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger transaction.\nDividends\nOn February 7, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per common share.  The dividend is payable March 1, 2024, to holders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2024.\n62\nShare Repurchases\nOn October 25, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization.  Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2012, our Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate of $25 billion of repurchases of our outstanding common stock, and we have repurchased 213.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $18 billion.  In 2023, we repurchased 37.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $4 billion.  Our share repurchase authorizations do not expire.  Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on various factors including our share price, results of operations, financial condition and cash required for future business plans.  Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.\nEmployee Benefit Plan Contributions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we contributed $391 million to our U.S. pension plans and $20 million to our international pension plans.\nMarketing and Specialties Acquisition\nOn August 1, 2023, we acquired a marketing business on the U.S. West Coast for total consideration of $269 million.  This acquisition supports the placement of renewable diesel that will be produced by the Rodeo renewable fuels facility.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase obligations, outstanding debt principal and interest obligations, operating and finance lease obligations, and asset retirement and environmental obligations.\nPurchase Obligations\nOur purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms.  We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled with operating cash flows in the period when due.  At December 31, 2023, our purchase obligations totaled $84.8 billion, with $40.7 billion due within one year.\nThe majority of our purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of commodities such as crude oil and NGL.  The commodities are used to supply our refineries and fractionators and optimize our supply chain.  At December 31, 2023, commodity purchase commitments with third parties and related parties were $44.2 billion and $23.9 billion, respectively.  The remaining purchase obligations mainly represent agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products, and our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.\nDebt Principal and Interest Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2023, our aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt was $19.5 billion, with $1.5 billion due within one year.  Our obligations for interest on the debt totaled $9.6 billion, with $870 million due within one year.  See Note 14—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt principal and interest obligations.\nFinance and Operating Lease Obligations\nSee Note 20—Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our lease obligations and timing of our expected lease payments.\nAsset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\nSee Note 12—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding asset retirement and environmental obligations.\n63\nCapital Spending\nOur capital expenditures and investments represent consolidated capital spending.\n* Includes 100% of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills capital expenditures and investments from August 18, 2022, forward, net of acquired cash.\n** Our share of joint ventures’ capital spending.\nMidstream\nCapital spending in our Midstream segment was $2.4 billion for the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, including:\n•\nExpansion of gathering systems in the DJ Basin and Permian Basin for DCP LP.\n•\nContinued development and expansion of fractionation capacity at our Sweeny Hub.  We completed and started operations of Sweeny Frac 4 in the third quarter of 2022.\n•\nCompletion of construction on our C2G Pipeline, a new 16-inch ethane pipeline that connects our Clemens Caverns storage facility to petrochemical facilities in Gregory, Texas, near Corpus Christi.\n•\nNet cash payment in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger.\n•\nInvestments in NOVONIX and a renewable feedstock processing plant.\n•\nContributions to Dakota Access for a pipeline optimization project, including a contribution to fund our 25% share of Dakota Access’ debt repayment.\n•\nSpending associated with other return, reliability, and maintenance projects in our Transportation and NGL businesses.\nChemicals\nDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, CPChem had a self-funded capital program that totaled $4.2 billion on a 100% basis.  Capital spending was primarily for the development of petrochemical projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Middle East, as well as sustaining, debottlenecking and optimization projects on existing assets.\n64\nRefining\nCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, was $3.1 billion, primarily for projects to enhance the yield of higher-value products, produce renewable fuels, and sustain the reliability and safety of our facilities.  Key projects funded during the three-year period included:\n•\nInstallation of facilities to produce renewable fuels at our San Francisco and Humber refineries.\n•\nInstallation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the Ponca City and Sweeny refineries, as well as the jointly owned Wood River Refinery.\n•\nInstallation of facilities to improve product value at the Lake Charles Refinery.\n•\nInstallation of facilities to improve utilization and product value at the jointly owned Borger refinery.\nMarketing and Specialties\nCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, was primarily for the acquisition of a marketing business and a commercial fleet fueling business on the U.S. West Coast, both of which will provide further placement opportunities for renewable diesel production to end-use customers; investment in a retail marketing joint venture in the U.S. Central region; and the continued acquisition, development and enhancement of retail sites in Europe.\nCorporate and Other\nCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, was primarily related to information technology and facilities.\n2024 Budget\nOur 2024 capital budget is $2.2 billion, including $923 million for sustaining capital and $1.3 billion for growth capital.  Our sustaining capital budget reflects $300 million of efficiencies as a result of our business transformation efforts.  Our projected $2.2 billion capital budget excludes our portion of planned capital spending by our major joint ventures CPChem and WRB totaling $1 billion.\nThe Midstream capital budget of $985 million comprises a growth capital budget of $593 million focused on enhancing our integrated NGL wellhead-to-market value chain, as well as $250 million related to the repayment of our 25% share of Dakota Access’ debt due in 2024.  The Midstream capital budget also includes $392 million for sustaining projects, including DCP LP’s sustaining capital of $200 million.  In Refining, the total capital budget of $1.1 billion consists of $412 million for sustaining capital and $654 million for growth capital.  Refining’s growth capital includes completing the conversion of the San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, into one of the world’s largest renewable fuels facilities.  Startup of the converted facility is expected in the first quarter of 2024.  Refining’s growth capital will also support high-return, low-capital projects to enhance market capture.  The M&S capital budget of $112 million reflects continued enhancement of our retail network, including energy transition opportunities.  The Corporate and Other capital budget of $68 million will primarily fund information technology projects.\n65\nContingencies\nA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us.  We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites.  We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies.  In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.  If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued.  We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries.  If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.  In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is uncertain.\nBased on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.  As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures.  Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters.  Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties.  Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.\nLegal and Tax Matters\nOur legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations.  These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions.  We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings.  Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation.  Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.  In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability.\n66\nEnvironmental\nWe are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  Among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the:\n•\nU.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.\n•\nU.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into bodies of water.\n•\nEuropean Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (EU REACH), which governs production, marketing and use of chemicals and the United Kingdom’s legislation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (UK REACH), which replaced EU REACH in the United Kingdom in 2021 following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (BREXIT).\n•\nU.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.\n•\nU.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.\n•\nU.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.\n•\nU.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of crude oil into navigable waters of the United States.\n•\nEuropean Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as the United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which replaced the EU ETS in the United Kingdom in 2021, following BREXIT.\nThese laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits.  They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations.  These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming.  In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application.  Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.\nOther countries and many states where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities.  While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders.  For example, in California the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) approved amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) that became effective in 2016, which required a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022, affecting refineries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.  In 2017, SCAQMD required additional nitrogen oxide emissions reductions through 2025 and, on November 5, 2021, promulgated new regulations to replace the RECLAIM program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime.\nThe ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emissions standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve.  However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate.  Notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.\n67\nAn example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA).  The law requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types.  Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) form the mechanism used by the EPA to record compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).  If an obligated party has more RINs than it needs to meet its obligation, it may sell or trade the extra RINs, or instead choose to “bank” them for use the following year.  We have met the EPA’s renewable volume obligations (RVO) to date.  These obligations have been met using a variety of operating and capital strategies.  We are also implementing advanced and different technologies to address projected future RVOs.  On June 21, 2023, the EPA finalized RVO for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 compliance years.  These standards increase cellulosic volumes, which reflect the EPA’s forecast for increasing compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG) volumes derived from biogas.  In addition, the EPA increased total advanced biofuel volumes from the 5.63 billion gallons established for the 2022 compliance year to 7.33 billion gallons in 2025.  We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products and increased program costs if not fully recovered in the market.  This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA’s final regulations establishing RVO requirements have been and continue to be subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding RVO requirements.\nWe are required to purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy the portion of our obligation under the RFS that is not fulfilled by blending renewable fuels into the motor fuels we produce.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we incurred expenses of $323 million, $478 million and $441 million, respectively, associated with our obligation to purchase RINs in the open market to comply with the RFS for our wholly owned refineries.  These expenses are included in the “Purchased crude oil and products” line item on our consolidated statement of income.  Our jointly owned refineries also incurred expenses associated with the purchase of RINs in the open market, of which our share was $389 million, $437 million and $351 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  These expenses are included in the “Equity in earnings of affiliates” line item on our consolidated statement of income.  The amount of these expenses and fluctuations between periods is primarily driven by the market price of RINs, refinery production, blending activities, and RVO requirements.\nWe also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations.  Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents.  Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States.  Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards.  In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for soil and groundwater and both the EPA and many states may adopt cleanup standards for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which may have been a constituent in certain firefighting foams used or stored at or near some of our facilities.\nAt RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions.  If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations.  In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs is typically borne solely by us.  We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years.  Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.\nWe occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute.  On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties.  These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations.  At December 31, 2022, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 22 sites within the United States.  During the last quarter of 2023, our legal organization approved the removal of one site following Department of Justice dismissal of Phillips 66, thus, leaving 21 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2023.\n68\nFor the majority of Superfund sites, our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low.  Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially.  Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned.  Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.  In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability.  Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan.  There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.\nWe incur costs related to the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of environmental pollution.  Expensed environmental costs were $824 million in 2023 and are expected to be approximately $885 million and $863 million in 2024 and 2025, respectively.  Capitalized environmental costs were $49 million in 2023 and are expected to be approximately $76 million and $216 million, in 2024 and 2025, respectively.  These amounts do not include capital expenditures made for other purposes that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.\nAccrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).\nMany of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed.  We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities.  If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.  In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA.  Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties.  Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material.  However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.\nClimate Change\nThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA.  These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future.  Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency reviews, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products.  Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:\n•\nEU ETS, which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial GHG emissions.  EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states.  As a result of the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU (BREXIT), those types of entities in the United Kingdom are now subject to the UK ETS, rather than the EU ETS.\n•\nEU Renewable Energy Directive II, which increases the EU’s energy consumption from renewable sources in the electricity, heat, and transportation sectors to 32% by 2030.\n69\n•\nUnited Kingdom’s Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, which is intended to reduce the GHG emissions from fuel used in the United Kingdom transportation sector by encouraging the supply of renewable fuels.\n•\nCalifornia’s Senate Bill No. 32, which requires reduction of California's GHG emissions to 40% below the 1990 emission level by 2030, and Assembly Bill 398, which extends the California GHG emission cap and trade program through 2030.  Other GHG emissions programs in states in the western U.S. have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, California’s Advanced Clean Cars and Trucks Programs, California’s Carbon Neutrality by 2045 Scoping Plan, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and Climate Protection Plan, and Washington's carbon reduction programs.\n•\nUnited States’ Inflation Reduction Act, which contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies, which is intended to accelerate the energy transition.\n•\nThe U.S. Supreme Court decision in\nMassachusetts v. EPA\n, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.\n•\nThe EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act.  These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change.\n•\nThe EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan.  The EPA commenced rulemaking in 2017 to rescind the Clean Power Plan and, in August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as its replacement.  On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia invalidated the ACE rule and remanded the matter to the EPA, essentially restarting this rulemaking process.\n•\nCarbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.\n•\nGHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.\nIn the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007.  Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through 2012, and Phase III ran from 2013 through to 2020.  Phase IV runs from January 1, 2021 through 2030 and sectors covered under the ETS must reduce their GHG emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels and there is agreement between the EU Member States, the European Parliament, and the EU Commission (which is pending ratification by the EU Council and European Parliament) to increase the Phase IV GHG emissions reduction to 63% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  The United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU ETS and, instead, has been under the UK ETS since 2021.  Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS and assets that are subject to the UK ETS.\nFrom November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France.  The conference culminated in what is known as the “Paris Agreement,” which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on November 4, 2016.  The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions.  In 2017, President Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and that withdrawal became effective on November 4, 2020.  On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed the “Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America,” which allows the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement.  The United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement in February 2021, which could lead to additional GHG emission reduction requirements for sources in the United States.\nIn the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming at the state or federal levels with respect to GHG emissions.  Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.\n70\nCompliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program, GHG reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation.  Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources.\nAn example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act.  The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California.  Inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs.  The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nWhether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.\n•\nThe nature of the legislation or regulation, such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions.\n•\nThe GHG reductions required.\n•\nThe price and availability of offsets.\n•\nThe demand for, and amount and allocation of allowances.\n•\nTechnological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.\n•\nAny potential significant physical effects of climate change, such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature.\n•\nWhether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.\nWe consider and take into account anticipated future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce GHG emissions.  Data on our GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making.  We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation efforts throughout our operations.\nIn February 2022, we announced a target to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity related to our operations by 50% of 2019 levels by the year 2050.  The 2050 target builds upon our 2030 GHG emissions intensity targets to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our operations by 30% and Scope 3 emissions from our energy products by 15% compared to 2019 levels.\nIn addition to the disclosures above, we have issued our 2023 Sustainability Report that is accessible on our website and provides more detailed information on our ESG initiatives, including information on environmental metrics and other topics of interest to our stakeholders, which may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes.   The information contained in the Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Form 10-K.\n71\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies.  Some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used.  The following discussion of critical accounting estimates addresses accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.\nBusiness Combination\nIn accounting for a business combination, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition.  The excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively.  A significant amount of judgment is made in estimating the individual fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, noncontrolling interests and other assets and liabilities.  We use available information to make these fair value determinations and engage third-party specialists in the valuation process as necessary.\nThe fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity specific differences.  The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain.  Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the estimated results used to determine fair value.\nSee Note 4—Business Combinations, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on our acquisitions in 2023 and 2022.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows.  If the sum of the undiscounted expected future before-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value.  Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets.  Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple for similar assets; historical market transactions including similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary; or replacement cost adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence.  The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments, including future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.\n72\nInvestments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount.  When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value.  When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery.  When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, if appropriate.  Different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.\nSee Note 11—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information about impairments recorded in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n73\nGUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nWe have various cross guarantees between Phillips 66 and its wholly owned subsidiary Phillips 66 Company (together, the Obligor Group) with respect to publicly held debt securities.  Phillips 66 conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries, including Phillips 66 Company, and those subsidiaries generate substantially all of its operating income and cash flow.  Phillips 66 has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of Phillips 66 Company with respect to its publicly held debt securities.  In addition, Phillips 66 Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of Phillips 66 with respect to its publicly held debt securities.  All guarantees are full and unconditional.  At December 31, 2023, $13.3 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding has been guaranteed by the Obligor Group.\nSummarized financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis.  Intercompany transactions among the members of the Obligor Group have been eliminated.  The financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries has been excluded from the summarized financial information.  Significant intercompany transactions and receivable/payable balances between the Obligor Group and non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented separately in the summarized financial information.\n74\nThe summarized results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the summarized financial position at December 31, 2023, of the Obligor Group on a combined basis were:\n75\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\nRefining\nOur realized refining margins measure the difference between (a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of petroleum products manufactured at our refineries and (b) costs of feedstocks, primarily crude oil, used to produce the petroleum products.  The realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries’ realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.”  The realized refining margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs (primarily crude oil) measured on a barrel basis, including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries.  Our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins, which are known as “crack spreads.”  As discussed in “Executive Overview and Business Environment—Business Environment,” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil.  We believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry refining margins.\nThe GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the Refining segment’s “income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.”  Realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income (loss) before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses.  It also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items.  Because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner, and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.  Following are reconciliations of income (loss) before income taxes to realized refining margins:\n76\n77\n78\nMarketing\nOur realized marketing fuel margins measure the difference between (a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of fuels in our M&S segment and (b) costs of those fuels.  The realized marketing fuel margins are adjusted to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.”  The realized marketing fuel margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by sales volumes measured on a barrel basis.  We believe realized marketing fuel margin per barrel demonstrates the value uplift our marketing operations provide by optimizing the placement and ultimate sale of our refineries’ fuel production.\nWithin the M&S segment, the GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized marketing fuel margin per barrel is the marketing business’ “income before income taxes per barrel.”  Realized marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses.  Because realized marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes these items, and because realized marketing fuel margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.  Following are reconciliations of income before income taxes to realized marketing fuel margins:\n79"

    "text": "Financial Instrument Market Risk\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to market risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL, natural gas, renewable feedstock and electric power, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  We and certain of our subsidiaries may hold and use derivative contracts to manage these risks.\nCommodity Price Risk\nGenerally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities.  Consistent with this policy, we use derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixed-price sales or purchase contracts, often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers, back to floating market prices.  We also use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:\n•\nBalance physical systems or meet our refinery requirements and market demand.  In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, certain exchange-traded futures may be settled by physical delivery of the underlying commodity.\n•\nEnable us to use the market knowledge gained from our physical commodity market activities to capture market opportunities, such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades.  Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities.\n•\nManage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL, renewable feedstock and natural gas transactions.\nThese objectives optimize the value of our supply chain and may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices.\nOur use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors.  This document prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations, and establishes Value at Risk (VaR) limits.  Compliance with these limits is monitored daily by our global risk group.\nWe use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative commodity instruments held or issued.  Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for derivative commodity instruments issued or held at December 31, 2023 and 2022, was immaterial to our cash flows and results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur use of fixed- or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk.  Fixed-rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates.  Fixed-rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market.  Variable-rate debt, such as our floating-rate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense.  The following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates.  These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates.  Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at each reporting date.  The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value.  The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices.\n80\n\\\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations.

The consolidated financial statements present fairly the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.  The company’s financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.  Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the company’s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders’ and directors’ meetings.\nAssessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Phillips 66’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.  In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013).  Based on this assessment, management concluded the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nErnst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, and their report is included herein.\nDate:  February 21, 2024\n85\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Phillips 66\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Phillips 66 (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, based on our audits and, for 2023 and 2022, the report of other auditors, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe did not audit the 2023 and 2022 financial statements of DCP Midstream, LP (DCP LP), a consolidated subsidiary, which reflect total assets constituting approximately 14% and 18% at December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, and total revenues constituting approximately 4% in 2023 and 3% in 2022 for the years then ended. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for DCP LP for 2023 and 2022, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n86\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and finance committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n88\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 21, 2024\n89\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors of DCP Midstream GP, LLC and the Unitholders of DCP Midstream, LP\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the consolidated balance sheets of DCP Midstream, LP and subsidiaries (the \"Partnership\") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”) (not presented herein).

The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net - Determination of Impairment Indicators and Recoverability Analysis for Asset Grouping in the South Region – Refer to Notes 2, 9 and 12 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Partnership evaluates on a quarterly basis whether the carrying value of long-lived assets should be impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of such long-lived assets may not be recoverable.  Management considers various factors when determining if long-lived assets should be evaluated for impairment including a significant adverse change in the legal or business climate, a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in the market value of an asset, or a current expectation that the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful life.\nThe Partnership’s determination of whether impairment indicators exist for long lived assets requires management to apply significant judgments and assumptions.  When events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Partnership evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the applicable asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (“recoverability analysis”) using the income approach and selecting a discount rate reflective of the risk inherent in future cash flows, and applying that discount rate to the cash flow projections.  If management determines the carrying value is not recoverable, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value.  This analysis resulted in management determining that an impairment triggering event had occurred at a certain asset group in the South region of the Gathering and Processing segment.  The triggering event is a reflection of the diminished probability of new well connects and margin degradation, commodity prices in the recently prepared budget forecasts, and a negative outlook for long-term production volume forecasts.  Management prepared a recoverability analysis and recognized a $209 million impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe considered the identification of impairment indicators for property, plant and equipment and the associated recoverability analysis as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions that management makes when determining whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred or could occur indicating that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable as well as the significant judgements and assumptions made in the undiscounted cash flow analysis used to evaluate recoverability.  This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to selection of the discount rate, the terminal value multiple, forecasted future gathering and processing volumes and future commodity pricing.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the identification of impairment indicators for long-lived assets included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting related to management’s identification of possible impairment indicators for long-lived assets that may indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over estimates of future volumes of raw natural gas, or other applicable throughput.\n91\n•\nWe evaluated management’s analysis of impairment indicators by:\n–\nConsidering industry and analysts reports and the impact of macroeconomic factors, such as adverse changes in the regulatory environment, legislation, significant weather events or other factors that may represent impairment indicators not previously contemplated in management's analysis\n–\nEvaluating management’s forecasts by comparing such forecasts to recent results of operations\n–\nInquiry of management over whether long-lived assets may be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of the assets' previously estimated useful life\n–\nInspecting minutes of the board of directors and committees of executive management to understand if there were factors that would represent potential impairment indicators for long-lived assets\nOur further audit procedures on the recoverability analysis included evaluating Management’s significant inputs, including forecasted gathering and processing volumes, future commodity prices, the terminal value multiple, and the selection of the discount rate applied to estimated future cash flows included in Management’s cash flow model, included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting related to management’s preparation and review of significant underlying assumptions used in the undiscounted cash flow model\n•\nFor asset groups for which a recoverability analysis was performed, we evaluated management’s estimates for significant inputs by:\n–\nEvaluating the reasonableness of volumetric assumptions by comparing forecasts to permits and rig count data including researching industry trends\n–\nPerforming a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the change in undiscounted cash flows that would result from changes in significant underlying assumptions\n–\nPerforming a lookback analysis by comparing historical results to management’s future assumptions to assess the reasonableness of estimates\n–\nEvaluating the reasonableness of management’s future commodity pricing forecasts by comparing to independent analysts’ estimates\n•\nWith the assistance of our Internal fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate and terminal value multiple by:\n–\nEvaluating the appropriateness of the mathematical model used to develop the discount rate\n–\nEvaluating the guideline public companies selected by management and used in the selection of the discount rate considering the comparability of operations to those of the Partnership\n–\nDeveloping a range of independent estimates of the discount rate by independently obtaining information to estimate components of the discount rate, including the cost of debt capital, the cost of equity capital, and debt-to-equity ratio\n–\nEvaluating the terminal value multiple in comparison to recent valuation metrics for companies of similar operations\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nDenver, Colorado\nFebruary 21, 2024\nWe have served as the Partnership’s auditor since 2004.\n92\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors of DCP Midstream GP, LLC and the Unitholders of DCP Midstream, LP\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of DCP Midstream, LP and subsidiaries (the \"Partnership\") as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Partnership (not presented herein) and our report dated February 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Partnership's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (not presented herein).  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nDenver, Colorado\nFebruary 21, 2024\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n99\nNote 1—\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation Principles and Investments\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) where we are the primary beneficiary.  Undivided interests in pipelines, natural gas plants and terminals are consolidated on a proportionate basis.  See Note 29—DCP Midstream Class A Segment for further discussion about a significant VIE that we began consolidating in August 2022, and Note 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, for further discussion regarding our merger with Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners).\nThe equity method is used to account for investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliates’ operating and financial policies, including VIEs, of which we are not the primary beneficiary.  Other securities and investments are generally carried at fair value, or cost less impairments, if any, adjusted up or down for price changes in similar financial instruments issued by the investee, when and if observed.  See Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for further discussion on our significant unconsolidated VIEs.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nForeign Currency\nAdjustments resulting from the process of translating financial statements with foreign functional currencies into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency into the functional currency of our subsidiary holding the asset or liability.  We include these transaction gains and losses in current earnings (loss).  Most of our foreign operations use their local currency as the functional currency.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and will mature within 90 days or less from the date of acquisition.  We carry these investments at cost plus accrued interest.\nInventories\nWe have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory.  Crude oil and petroleum products inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market in the aggregate, primarily on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis.  Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis.  LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues and to meet tax-conformity requirements.  Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location.  Materials and supplies inventories are valued using the weighted-average-cost method.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, through market-corroborated inputs.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are used to measure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, and that reflect the assumptions we believe market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date.\n100\nDerivative Instruments\nDerivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchases and normal sales, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  We have master netting agreements with most of our exchange-cleared instrument counterparties and certain of our counterparties to other commodity instrument contracts (e.g., physical commodity forward contracts).  We have elected to net derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty on the balance sheet if the legal right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met.  When applicable, we also net collateral payables and receivables against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative.  All realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments for which we do not apply hedge accounting are immediately recognized in our consolidated statement of income.  Unrealized gains or losses from derivative instruments that qualify for and are designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and appear on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged transactions are recognized in earnings.  However, to the extent the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument exceeds the change in the anticipated cash flows of the hedged transaction, the excess gain or loss is recognized immediately in earnings.\nLoans and Long-Term Receivables\nWe enter into agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which may require us to provide loans or advances to certain affiliated and nonaffiliated companies.  Loans are recorded when cash is transferred or seller financing is provided to the affiliated or nonaffiliated company pursuant to a loan agreement.  The loan balance will increase as interest is earned on the outstanding loan balance and will decrease as interest and principal payments are received.  Interest is earned at the loan agreement’s stated interest rate.  Loans and long-term receivables are evaluated for impairment based on an expected credit loss assessment.\nImpairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities\nInvestments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred.  When indicators exist, the fair value is estimated and compared to the investment carrying value.  If any impairment is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value.  The fair value of the impaired investment is determined based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization of properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) are determined by either the individual-unit-straight-line method or the group-straight-line method (for those individual units that are highly integrated with other units).\nCapitalized Interest\nA portion of interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period of\none year\nor longer.  Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the related asset, and is amortized over the useful life of the related asset.\n101\nImpairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment\nPP&E used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group.  If indicators of potential impairment exist, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed.  If the sum of the undiscounted expected future before-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value of the asset group, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value of the PP&E included in the asset group is written down to estimated fair value and the write down is reported in the “Impairments” line item on our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the impairment determination is made.  Individual assets are grouped for impairment testing purposes at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.  Because there is usually a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple of earnings for similar assets; historical market transactions for similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary; or replacement cost adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence.  Long-lived assets held for sale are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, estimated replacement cost, or present value of expected future cash flows as previously described.\nThe expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future volumes, prices, costs, margins and capital project decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review.\nProperty Dispositions\nWhen complete units of depreciable property are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the “Net gain on dispositions” line item on our consolidated statement of income.  When less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired, the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination.  Goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstance indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is below its carrying value.  The impairment assessment requires allocating goodwill and other assets and liabilities to reporting units.  The fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the book value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.  A goodwill impairment cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  For purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment, we have\ntwo\nreporting units with goodwill balances at our 2023 testing date: Transportation and Marketing and Specialties (M&S).\nIntangible Assets Other Than Goodwill\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives.  Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment.  Each reporting period, we evaluate intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support this classification.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired if their fair value is lower than their net book value.  The fair value of intangible assets is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.  If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value of intangible assets is determined based upon the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or upon estimated replacement cost, if expected future cash flows from the intangible asset are not determinable.\n102\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWhen we have a legal obligation to incur costs to retire an asset, we record a liability in the period in which the obligation was incurred provided that a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.  If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made at the time the obligation arises, we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate its fair value.  When a liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related PP&E.  Over time, the liability is increased for changes in present value, and the capitalized costs in PP&E are depreciated over the useful life of the related assets.  If our estimate of the liability changes after initial recognition, we record an adjustment to the liability and PP&E.\nOur practice is to keep our refining and other processing assets in good operating condition through routine repair and maintenance of component parts in the ordinary course of business and by continuing to make improvements based on technological advances.  As a result, we believe that generally these assets have no expected retirement dates for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations since the dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire these assets cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.  We will recognize liabilities for these obligations in the period when sufficient information becomes available to estimate a date or range of potential retirement dates.\nEnvironmental Costs\nEnvironmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefit.  Expenditures relating to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed.  When environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated, environmental expenditures are accrued on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a business combination).  Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties, such as state reimbursement funds, are recorded as a reduction to environmental expenditures.\nGuarantees\nThe fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given.  The initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee.  We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee.  We amortize the guarantee liability to the related statement of income line item based on the nature of the guarantee.  In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we have information to support the reversal.  When the performance on the guarantee becomes probable and the liability can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a separate liability for the excess amount above the guarantee’s book value based on the facts and circumstances at that time.  We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.\nTreasury Stock\nWe record treasury stock purchases at cost, which includes related transaction costs.  Amounts are recorded as reductions of stockholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheet.  Common stock reissued from treasury stock is valued based on the average cost of historical repurchases.\n103\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily associated with sales of refined petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas.  Each gallon, or other unit of measure of product, is separately identifiable and represents a distinct performance obligation to which a transaction price is allocated.  The transaction prices of our contracts with customers are either fixed or variable, with variable pricing based upon various market indices.  For our contracts that include variable consideration, we utilize the variable consideration allocation exception, whereby the variable consideration is only allocated to the performance obligations that are satisfied during the period.  The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control passes to the customer, which is when title and the risk of ownership passes to the customer and physical delivery of goods occurs, either immediately or within a fixed delivery schedule that is reasonable and customary in the industry.  The payment terms with our customers vary based on the product or service provided, but usually are\n30\ndays or less.\nRevenues associated with pipeline transportation services are recognized at a point in time when the volumes are delivered based on contractual rates.  Revenues associated with terminaling and storage services are recognized over time as the services are performed based on throughput volume or capacity utilization at contractual rates.\nRevenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into in contemplation of one another, are combined and reported in the “Purchased crude oil and products” line item on our consolidated statement of income (i.e., these transactions are recorded net).\nTaxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities\nExcise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products charged to our customers are presented net of taxes on sales of refined petroleum products payable to governmental authorities in the “Taxes other than income taxes” line item on our consolidated statement of income.  Other sales and value-added taxes are recorded net in the “Taxes other than income taxes” line item on our consolidated statement of income.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nWe have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment activities and include these activities in the “Purchased crude oil and products” line item on our consolidated statement of income.  Freight costs billed to customers are recorded in “Sales and other operating revenues.”\nMaintenance and Repairs\nCosts of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred.  Major refinery maintenance turnarounds are expensed as incurred.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of: (1) the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or (2) the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than\nten months\nfor shared-based payment awards granted in 2023 and not less than\nsix months\nfor share-based payment awards granted prior to 2023 as those are the minimum periods of time required for awards not to be subject to forfeiture.  Our equity-classified programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time they become eligible for retirement (at age\n55\nwith\n5\nyears of service).  We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, irrespective of whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting, and have elected to recognize forfeitures of awards when they occur.\n104\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income (loss) in the period that includes the enactment date.  Income tax effects are released from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings, when applicable, on an individual item basis as those items are reclassified into income.  Interest related to unrecognized income tax benefits is reflected in the “Interest and debt expense” line item, and penalties in the “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line items on our consolidated statement of income.\n105\nNote 2—\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nEffective January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-04, “Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.”  This ASU requires the buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about the program.  At the time of adoption, this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nEffective January 1, 2022, we early adopted ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.”  This pronouncement requires application of ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“Topic 606”) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination.  The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nEffective October 1, 2021, we adopted ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” and ASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope.”  These pronouncements provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contracts, hedge relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform.  Amendments in ASU 2021-01 further clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition.  These pronouncements were effective upon issuance and applicable to contract modifications through December 31, 2022.  On December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848.”  The ASU defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848.  This pronouncement was also effective upon issuance.  The adoption of these pronouncements did not impact our consolidated financial statements.\n106\nNote 3—\nDCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers\nDCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger (DCP Midstream Merger)\nOn August 17, 2022, we and our co-venturer, Enbridge Inc. (Enbridge), agreed to merge DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream) and Gray Oak Holdings LLC (Gray Oak Holdings), with DCP Midstream as the surviving entity.\nPrior to the DCP Midstream Merger, we and Enbridge each held a\n50\n% interest and jointly governed DCP Midstream, whose primary assets are its general partner and limited partner interests in DCP Midstream, LP (DCP LP), and we each held indirect economic interests in DCP LP of\n28.26\n%.  DCP LP is a VIE because its limited partners do not have the ability to remove its general partner with a simple majority vote, nor do its limited partners have substantive participating rights in the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of business.  DCP Midstream ultimately consolidates DCP LP because one of its wholly owned subsidiaries is the primary beneficiary of DCP LP.\nWe and Enbridge also held\n65\n% and\n35\n% interests, respectively, in Gray Oak Holdings, whose primary asset was a\n65\n% noncontrolling interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC (Gray Oak Pipeline).  Our and Enbridge’s indirect economic interests in Gray Oak Pipeline were\n42.25\n% and\n22.75\n%, respectively.  We had voting control over and consolidated Gray Oak Holdings and reported Gray Oak Holdings’\n65\n% interest in Gray Oak Pipeline as an equity investment and Enbridge’s interest in Gray Oak Holdings as a noncontrolling interest.\nIn connection with the DCP Midstream Merger, we and Enbridge entered into a Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of DCP Midstream (Amended and Restated LLC Agreement), which realigned the members’ economic interests and governance responsibilities.  Under the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement,\ntwo\nclasses of membership interests in DCP Midstream were created, Class A and Class B, that are intended to track the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the following operating segments of DCP Midstream:\n•\nClass A Segment comprised of the businesses, activities, assets and liabilities of DCP LP and its subsidiaries and its general partner entities (DCP Midstream Class A Segment).\n•\nClass B Segment comprised of the business, activities, assets and liabilities of Gray Oak Pipeline (DCP Midstream Class B Segment).\nWe hold a\n76.64\n% Class A membership interest, which represents an indirect economic interest in DCP LP of\n43.3\n%, and a\n10\n% Class B membership interest, which represents an indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline of\n6.5\n%.  Enbridge holds the remaining Class A and Class B membership interests.  We have been designated as the managing member of DCP Midstream Class A Segment and are responsible for conducting, directing and managing all activities associated with this segment, except as limited in certain instances.  Enbridge has been designated as the managing member of DCP Midstream Class B Segment.  Earnings and distributions from each segment are allocated to the members based on their membership interest in each membership class, except as otherwise provided.\nDCP Midstream Class A Segment and DCP Midstream Class B Segment were determined to be silos under the variable interest consolidation model.\nAs a result, DCP Midstream was also determined to be a VIE.  We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of DCP Midstream Class A Segment because of the governance rights granted to us under the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement as managing member of the segment.\nWe hold a\n33.33\n% direct ownership interest in DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Southern Hills).  DCP LP holds the remaining\n66.67\n% ownership interest in these entities.  As a result of the governance rights granted to us over DCP Midstream Class A Segment and the governance rights we hold through our direct ownership interests, we obtained controlling financial interests in these entities in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger.  As a result of the DCP Midstream Merger, our aggregate direct and indirect economic interests in DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills increased from\n52.2\n% to\n62.2\n%.\nStarting on August 18, 2022, we began consolidating the financial results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills and reporting the direct and indirect economic interests held by others in these entities as noncontrolling interests on our financial statements.\n107\nWe account for our remaining indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, now held through DCP Midstream Class B Segment, using the equity method of accounting.  As a result of the DCP Midstream Merger, we derecognized Enbridge’s noncontrolling interest in Gray Oak Holdings.\nWe accounted for our consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.  See Note 4—Business Combinations, for additional information regarding our accounting for this transaction.  See Note 29—DCP Midstream Class A Segment, for additional information regarding our variable interest in DCP Midstream Class A Segment.\nDCP Midstream, LP Merger (DCP LP Merger)\nOn June 15, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all publicly held common units of DCP LP pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 5, 2023 (DCP LP Merger Agreement).  The DCP LP Merger Agreement was entered into with DCP LP, its subsidiaries and its general partner entities, pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries merged with and into DCP LP, with DCP LP surviving as a Delaware limited partnership.  Under the terms of the DCP LP Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the DCP LP Merger, each publicly held common unit representing a limited partner interest in DCP LP (other than the common units owned by DCP Midstream and its subsidiaries) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time was converted into the right to receive $\n41.75\nper common unit in cash.  We accounted for the DCP LP Merger as an equity transaction.  The DCP LP Merger increased our aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in DCP LP from\n43.3\n% to\n86.8\n% and our aggregate direct and indirect economic interests in DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills increased from\n62.2\n% to\n91.2\n%.\nSee Note 29—DCP Midstream Class A Segment, for additional information regarding the equity transaction.\nNote 4—\nBusiness Combinations\nMarketing and Specialties Acquisition\nOn August 1, 2023, our M&S segment acquired a marketing business on the U.S. West Coast for total consideration of $\n269\nmillion. These operations were acquired to support the placement of renewable diesel that will be produced by our Rodeo renewable fuels facility. At December 31, 2023, we provisionally recorded $\n146\nmillion of amortizable intangible assets, primarily customer relationships; $\n82\nmillion of PP&E, including finance lease right of use assets; $\n40\nmillion of net working capital; $\n64\nmillion of goodwill; and $\n63\nmillion of finance lease liabilities for this acquisition.  The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and subject to change until we finalize our accounting for this acquisition.\nDCP Midstream Merger\nOn August 17, 2022, we realigned our economic interest in, and governance rights over, DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings through the DCP Midstream Merger, with DCP Midstream as the surviving entity.  As part of the DCP Midstream Merger, we transferred a\n35.75\n% indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline and contributed $\n404\nmillion of cash to DCP Midstream, which was then paid to Enbridge, in return for a\n15.05\n% incremental indirect economic ownership interest in DCP LP.  As noted above, the additional governance rights we were granted as part of this transaction resulted in us consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment, as well as DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills.  Given the nature of this transaction, we have accounted for the consolidation of these entities using the acquisition method of accounting.\nThe components of the fair value of the DCP Midstream Merger consideration are:\n108\nThe aggregate purchase consideration noted above was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the entities consolidated based upon their estimated fair values as of the DCP Midstream Merger on August 17, 2022.  We finalized the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the three months ended September 30, 2023, prior to the end of the one-year measurement period on August 16, 2023.\nThe following table shows the purchase price allocation as of the date of the DCP Midstream Merger, and cumulative adjustments we made during the measurement period:\nThe adjustments reflected in the table above include reclassification adjustments we made to the purchase price allocation to conform with our historical presentation and adjustments we made to the estimated fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period.  The adjustments to our purchase price allocation recorded during the measurement period were not material.  See Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, for additional information on the determination of the fair value of the DCP Midstream Merger.\n109\nIn connection with the DCP Midstream Merger, we recognized before-tax gains totaling $\n2,831\nmillion from remeasuring our previously held equity investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills to their fair values and a before tax gain of $\n182\nmillion related to the transfer of a\n35.75\n% indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline to our co-venturer.  These before-tax gains are included in the “Other income” line item in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022, and are reported in the Midstream segment.  See Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, for additional information on the determination of the fair value of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills.\nThe following “Sales and other operating revenues” and “Net Income Attributable to Phillips 66” of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills were included in our consolidated statement of income from August 18, 2022, forward, for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents consolidated results for the years ending December 31, 2022, and 2021, as if the DCP Midstream Merger occurred on January 1, 2021.  The unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments based on available information, and we believe the estimates and assumptions used are reasonable, and that the significant effects of the transactions are properly reflected in the unaudited pro forma information.  An aggregate before-tax gain of $\n2,831\nmillion was included in the pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is related to the remeasurement of the previously held equity investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills to their fair values in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger.  Adjustments related to the economic interest change in our equity investment in Gray Oak Pipeline were excluded from the pro forma financial information.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information presented is for comparative purposes only and does not give effect to any potential synergies that could be achieved and is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations.\n110\nNote 5—\nSales and Other Operating Revenues\nDisaggregated Revenues\nThe following tables present our disaggregated sales and other operating revenues:\n* Includes derivatives-related activities.  See Note 17—Derivatives and Financial Instruments, for additional information.\n** Sales and other operating revenues are attributable to countries based on the location of the operations generating the revenues.\nContract-Related Assets and Liabilities\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, receivables from contracts with customers were $\n9,638\nmillion and $\n8,749\nmillion, respectively.  Significant noncustomer balances, such as buy/sell receivables and excise tax receivables, were excluded from these amounts.\nOur contract-related assets also include payments we make to our marketing customers related to incentive programs.  An incentive payment is initially recognized as an asset and subsequently amortized as a reduction to revenue over the contract term, which generally ranges from\n5\nto\n15\nyears.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our asset balances related to such payments were $\n537\nmillion and $\n505\nmillion, respectively.\nOur contract liabilities primarily represent advances from our customers prior to product or service delivery.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, contract liabilities were $\n187\nmillion and $\n156\nmillion, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nMost of our contracts with customers are spot contracts or term contracts with only variable consideration.  We do not disclose remaining performance obligations for these contracts as the expected duration is one year or less or because the variable consideration has been allocated entirely to an unsatisfied performance obligation.  We also have certain contracts in our Midstream segment that include minimum volume commitments with fixed pricing.  At December 31, 2023, the remaining performance obligations related to these minimum volume commitment contracts amounted to $\n365\nmillion.  This amount excludes variable consideration and estimates of variable rate escalation clauses in our contracts with customers, and is expected to be recognized through 2031 with a weighted average remaining life of\ntwo years\nas of December 31, 2023.\n111\nNote 6—\nCredit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our sales of refined petroleum products, crude oil, NGL and natural gas.  We assess each counterparty’s ability to pay for the products we sell by conducting a credit review.  The credit review considers our expected billing exposure and timing for payment and the counterparty’s established credit rating or our assessment of the counterparty’s creditworthiness based on our analysis of their financial statements when a credit rating is not available.  We also consider contract terms and conditions, country and political risk, and business strategy in our evaluation.  A credit limit is established for each counterparty based on the outcome of this review.  We may require collateralized asset support or a prepayment to mitigate credit risk.\nWe monitor our ongoing credit exposure through active review of counterparty balances against contract terms and due dates.  Our activities include timely account reconciliations, dispute resolution and payment confirmations.  We may employ collection agencies and legal counsel to pursue recovery of defaulted receivables.  In addition, when events and circumstances arise that may affect certain counterparties’ abilities to fulfill their obligations, we enhance our credit monitoring, and we may seek collateral to support some transactions or require prepayments from higher-risk counterparties.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, we reported $\n11,730\nmillion and $\n10,985\nmillion of accounts and notes receivable, net of allowances of $\n71\nmillion and $\n67\nmillion, respectively.  Based on an aging analysis at December 31, 2023, more than\n95\n% of our accounts receivable were outstanding less than 60 days.\nWe are also exposed to credit losses from off-balance sheet exposures, such as guarantees of joint venture debt and standby letters of credit.  See Note 15—Guarantees, and Note 16—Contingencies and Commitments, for more information on these off-balance sheet exposures.\nNote 7—\nInventories\nInventories at December 31 consisted of the following:\nInventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled $\n3,050\nmillion and $\n2,635\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The estimated excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories amounted to approximately $\n5.3\nbillion and $\n6.3\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring each of the three years ended December 31, 2023, certain volume reductions in inventory caused liquidations of LIFO inventory values.  For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, LIFO inventory liquidations increased net income by $\n94\nmillion and $\n75\nmillion, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2021, LIFO inventory liquidations decreased net income by $\n101\nmillion.\n112\nNote 8—\nInvestments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables\nComponents of investments and long-term receivables at December 31 were:\nEquity Investments\nSignificant affiliated companies accounted for under the equity method, including nonconsolidated VIEs, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, included:\n•\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem)\n—\n50\npercent-owned joint venture that manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics.  We have multiple long-term supply and purchase agreements in place with CPChem with extension options.  These agreements cover sales and purchases of refined petroleum products, solvents, fuel gas, natural gas, NGL, and other petrochemical feedstocks.  All products are purchased and sold under specified pricing formulas based on various published pricing indices.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the book value of our investment in CPChem was $\n7,341\nmillion and $\n6,785\nmillion, respectively.\n•\nWRB Refining LP (WRB)\n—\n50\npercent-owned joint venture that owns the Wood River and Borger refineries located in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively, for which we are the operator and managing partner.  We have a basis difference for our investment in WRB because the carrying value of our investment is lower than our share of WRB’s recorded net assets.  This basis difference was primarily the result of our contribution of these refineries to WRB.  On the contribution closing date, a basis difference was created because the fair value of the contributed assets recorded by WRB exceeded our historical book value.  The contribution-related basis difference is primarily being amortized and recognized as a benefit to equity earnings over a period of\n26\nyears, which was the estimated remaining useful life of the refineries’ PP&E at the contribution closing date.  At December 31, 2023, the aggregate remaining basis difference for this investment was $\n1,400\nmillion.  Equity earnings for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were increased by $\n198\nmillion, $\n184\nmillion and $\n186\nmillion, respectively, due to the amortization of our aggregate basis difference.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the book value of our investment in WRB was $\n2,736\nmillion and $\n2,411\nmillion, respectively.\n•\nGulf Coast Express LLC (Gulf Coast Express)\n—DCP LP\n25\npercent-owned joint venture that owns an intrastate pipeline that transports natural gas from the Waha area in West Texas to Agua Dulce, in Nueces County, Texas.  The pipeline is operated by a co-venturer.  This investment was acquired as part of our consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment starting on August 18, 2022, and was recorded at fair value.  We have a basis difference for our investment in Gulf Coast Express because the carrying value of our investment is higher than our share of Gulf Coast Express net assets.  The basis difference is the result of recognizing the investment at fair value.  The basis difference is being amortized and recognized as a decrease to equity earnings over a period of\n20\nyears, which was the estimated remaining useful life of the joint venture’s PP&E at the acquisition date.  At December 31, 2023, the aggregate remaining basis difference for this investment was $\n415\nmillion.  Equity earnings for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were decreased by $\n22\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion, respectively, due to the amortization of our basis difference.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the book value of our investment in Gulf Coast Express was $\n800\nmillion and $\n844\nmillion, respectively.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, Note 4—Business Combinations and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, for additional information on the DCP Midstream Merger and our accounting for this transaction as a business combination.\n113\n•\nDakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO)\n—\nTwo\n25\npercent-owned joint ventures.  Dakota Access owns a pipeline system that transports crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and ETCO owns a connecting crude oil pipeline system that extends from Patoka to Nederland, Texas.  These\ntwo\npipeline systems collectively form the Bakken Pipeline system, which is operated by a co-venturer.\nIn 2020, the trial court presiding over litigation brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (the Tribe) ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) addressing an easement under Lake Oahe in North Dakota.  The trial court later vacated the easement.  Although the easement is vacated, the USACE has no plans to stop pipeline operations while it proceeds with the EIS, and the Tribe’s request for a shutdown was denied in May 2021.  In June 2021, the trial court dismissed the litigation entirely. Once the EIS is completed, new litigation or challenges may be filed.\nIn February 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court (the Court) denied Dakota Access’ writ of certiorari requesting the Court to review the trial court’s decision to order the EIS and vacate the easement.  Therefore, the requirement to prepare the EIS stood.  Also in February 2022, the Tribe withdrew as a cooperating agency, causing the USACE to halt the EIS process while the USACE engaged with the Tribe on their reasons for withdrawing.\nThe draft EIS process resumed in August 2022, and in September 2023 the USACE published its draft EIS for public comment.  The USACE identified five potential outcomes, but did not indicate which one it preferred.  The options comprise two “no action” alternatives where the USACE would deny an easement to Dakota Access and require it to shut down the pipeline and either remove the pipe from under Lake Oahe, or allow the pipeline to be abandoned-in-place under the lake.  The USACE also identified three “action” alternatives; two of them contemplate that the USACE would reissue the easement to Dakota Access under essentially the same terms as 2017 with either the same or a larger volume of oil allowed through the pipeline, while the third alternative would require decommissioning the current pipeline and construction of a new line 39 miles upstream from the current location.  The USACE has not indicated when it will issue its final decision.\nDakota Access and ETCO have guaranteed repayment of senior unsecured notes issued by a wholly owned subsidiary of Dakota Access in March 2019.  On April 1, 2022, Dakota Access’ wholly owned subsidiary repaid $\n650\nmillion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior notes upon maturity.  We funded our\n25\n% share, or $\n163\nmillion, with a capital contribution of $\n89\nmillion in March 2022 and $\n74\nmillion of distributions we elected not to receive from Dakota Access in the first quarter of 2022.  At December 31, 2023, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of Dakota Access’ senior unsecured notes was $\n1.85\nbillion.\nIn conjunction with the notes offering, Phillips 66 Partners, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, and its co-venturers in Dakota Access also provided a Contingent Equity Contribution Undertaking (CECU).  Under the CECU, the co-venturers may be severally required to make proportionate equity contributions to Dakota Access if there is an unfavorable final judgment in the above-mentioned ongoing litigation.  At December 31, 2023, our\n25\n% share of the maximum potential equity contributions under the CECU was approximately $\n467\nmillion.\nIf the pipeline is required to cease operations, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  Should operations cease and Dakota Access and ETCO not have sufficient funds to pay its expenses, we also could be required to support our\n25\n% share of the ongoing expenses, including scheduled interest payments on the notes of approximately $\n20\nmillion annually, in addition to the potential obligations under the CECU at December 31, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate book value of our investments in Dakota Access and ETCO was $\n640\nmillion and $\n675\nmillion, respectively.\n114\n•\nFront Range Pipeline LLC (Front Range)\n—DCP LP\n33\npercent-owned joint venture that owns an NGL pipeline that originates in the DJ Basin and extends to Skellytown, Texas.  The pipeline is operated by a co-venturer.  This investment was acquired as part of our consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment starting on August 18, 2022, and was recorded at fair value.  We have a basis difference for our investment in Front Range because the carrying value of our investment is higher than our share of Front Range net assets.  The basis difference is the result of recognizing the investment at fair value.  The basis difference is being amortized and recognized as a decrease to equity earnings over a period of\n20\nyears, which was the estimated remaining useful life of the joint venture’s PP&E at the acquisition date.  At December 31, 2023, the aggregate remaining basis difference for this investment was $\n292\nmillion.  Equity earnings for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were decreased by $\n16\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion, respectively, due to the amortization of our basis difference.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the book value of our investment in Front Range was $\n477\nmillion and $\n499\nmillion, respectively.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, Note 4—Business Combinations and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, for additional information on the DCP Midstream Merger and our accounting for this transaction as a business combination.\n•\nRockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX)\n—\n25\npercent-owned joint venture that owns a natural gas pipeline system that extends from Wyoming and Colorado to Ohio with a bidirectional section that extends from Ohio to Illinois.  The REX Pipeline system is operated by our co-venturer.  We have a basis difference for our investment in REX because the carrying value of our investment is lower than our share of REX’s recorded net assets.  This basis difference was created by historical impairment charges we recorded for this investment and is being amortized and recognized as a benefit to equity earnings over a period of\n25\nyears, which was the estimated remaining useful life of REX’s PP&E when the impairment charges were recorded.  At December 31, 2023, the remaining basis difference for this investment was $\n261\nmillion.  Equity earnings for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were increased by $\n19\nmillion due to the amortization of our basis difference.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the book value of our investment in REX was $\n451\nmillion and $\n483\nmillion, respectively.\n•\nCF United LLC (CF United)\n—A retail marketing joint venture with operations primarily on the U.S. West Coast. We own a\n50\n% voting interest and a\n48\n% economic interest in this joint venture.  At December 31, 2023, CF United was considered a VIE because our co-venturer had an option to require us to purchase its interest based on a fixed multiple.  The put option became effective July 1, 2023, and was scheduled to expire on March 31, 2024.  The put option was viewed as a variable interest as the purchase price on the exercise date may not represent the then-current fair value of CF United.  We determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of CF United because we and our co-venturer jointly directed the activities that most significantly impacted economic performance.\nAt December 31, 2023, our maximum exposure to loss was comprised of our $\n291\nmillion investment in CF United.  At December 31, 2022, the book value of our investment in CF United was $\n296\nmillion.\nEffective January 1, 2024, in connection with an acquisition by CF United of another joint venture in which we have an ownership interest, the governing agreement for the CF United joint venture was amended and restated.  The amended and restated agreement included removal of the put option that required us to purchase our co-venturer’s interest based on a fixed multiple.  Accordingly, CF United ceased to be a VIE effective January 1, 2024.\n•\nOnCue Holdings, LLC (OnCue)\n—\n50\npercent-owned joint venture that owns and operates retail convenience stores.  We fully guaranteed various debt agreements of OnCue, and our co-venturer did not participate in the guarantees.  This entity is considered a VIE because our debt guarantees resulted in OnCue not being exposed to all potential losses.  We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance.  At December 31, 2023, our maximum exposure to loss was $\n231\nmillion, which represented the book value of our investment in OnCue of $\n166\nmillion and guaranteed debt obligations of $\n65\nmillion.  At December 31, 2022, the book value of our investment in OnCue was $\n138\nmillion.\n115\n•\nDCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills, DCP Southern Hills, and Gray Oak Pipeline\n—Prior to the DCP Midstream Merger on August 17, 2022, we held:\n◦\nA\n50\n% interest in DCP Midstream a joint venture that owns and operates NGL and gas pipelines, gas plants, gathering systems, storage facilities and fractionation plants, through its subsidiary DCP LP.\n◦\nA\n33.33\n% direct ownership interest in DCP Sand Hills a joint venture that owns a NGL pipeline system that extends from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford to facilities on the Texas Gulf Coast and to the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market hub.\n◦\nA\n33.33\n% direct ownership interest in DCP Southern Hills a joint venture that owns a NGL pipeline system that extends from the Midcontinent region to the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market hub.\n◦\nA\n65\n% interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, which was held through a consolidated holding company, Gray Oak Holdings.  Our indirect interest in Gray Oak Pipeline was\n42.25\n%, after considering a co-venturer’s\n35\n% interest in Gray Oak Holdings.  Gray Oak Pipeline is a crude oil pipeline that extends from the Permian and Eagle Ford to Texas Gulf Coast destinations that include Corpus Christi, Texas, and the Sweeny area, including our Sweeny Refinery.\nAs a result of the DCP Midstream Merger, effective August 18, 2022, we began consolidating the financial results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills and our indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline was reduced to\n6.5\n%.  After the DCP Midstream Merger, our indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline is held through our economic interest in DCP Midstream Class B Segment.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, and Note 4—Business Combinations, for additional information regarding the DCP Midstream Merger and associated accounting treatment.\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the book value of our investment in DCP Midstream Class B Segment was $\n75\nmillion and $\n79\nmillion, respectively.\n•\nLiberty Pipeline LLC (Liberty)\n—In the first quarter of 2021, Phillips 66 Partners’ decided to exit the Liberty Pipeline project, which resulted in a $\n198\nmillion before-tax impairment.  The impairment is included in the “Impairments” line item on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.  In April 2021, Phillips 66 Partners transferred its ownership interest in Liberty to its co-venturer for cash and certain pipeline assets with a value that approximated its book value of $\n46\nmillion at March 31, 2021.  See Note 11—Impairments, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, for additional information regarding the impairment and the techniques used to determine the fair value of Phillips 66 Partners’ investment in Liberty.\nMidstream Investment Disposition\nOn August 1, 2023, we sold our\n25\n% ownership interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal for approximately $\n275\nmillion and recognized a before-tax gain of $\n101\nmillion.  The before-tax gain is included in the “Net gain on dispositions” line item on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2023, and is reported in the Midstream segment.\n116\nOther Investments\nIn September 2021, we acquired\n78\nmillion ordinary shares, representing a\n16\n% ownership interest, in NOVONIX Limited (NOVONIX), for $\n150\nmillion.  NOVONIX is a Brisbane, Australia-based company that develops technology and supplies materials for lithium-ion batteries and its shares are traded on the Australian Securities Exchange.  Since we do not have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of NOVONIX and the shares we own have a readily determinable fair value, our investment is recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period.  The fair value of our investment is recorded in the “Investments and long-term receivables” line item on our consolidated balance sheet.  The change in the fair value of our investment due to fluctuations in NOVONIX’s stock price, or unrealized investment gain (losses), is recorded in the “Other income” line item of our consolidated statement of income, while changes due to foreign currency fluctuations are recorded in the “Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses” line item on our consolidated statement of income.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX was $\n39\nmillion and $\n78\nmillion, respectively.  The fair value of our investment in NOVONIX declined by $\n39\nmillion and $\n442\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and increased by $\n370\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021.  The declines in fair value in 2023 and 2022 were primarily related to unrealized investment losses, while the increase in 2021 was primarily related to unrealized investment gains.  See Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, for additional information regarding the recurring fair value measurement of our investment in NOVONIX.\nRelated Party Loans\nWe and our co-venturer have provided member loans to WRB.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, no member loans were outstanding.\nEquity Affiliate Distributions\nTotal distributions received from affiliates were $\n1,396\nmillion, $\n1,832\nmillion, and $\n3,043\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  In addition, at December 31, 2023, retained earnings included approximately $\n3.3\nbillion related to the undistributed earnings of affiliated companies.\nSummarized Equity Affiliate Financial Information\nSummarized 100% financial information for all affiliated companies accounted for under the equity method, on a combined basis, was:\n117\nNote 9—\nProperties, Plants and Equipment\nOur investment in PP&E is recorded at cost.  Investments in refining and processing facilities are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a\n25\n-year life, pipeline assets over a\n45\n-year life and terminal assets over a\n35\n-year life.\nThe company’s investment in PP&E, with the associated accumulated depreciation and amortization (Accum. D&A), at December 31 was:\nSee Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, Note 4—Business Combinations and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, for additional information on the DCP Midstream Merger, accounting treatment and the associated fair value measurements.  See Note 11—Impairments, for information regarding PP&E impairments associated with our Alliance Refinery asset group.  See Note 28—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, for information regarding the change in the composition of our operating segments.\n118\nNote 10—\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nThe carrying amount of goodwill by segment at December 31 was:\nIn August 2023, we acquired a marketing business on the U.S. West Coast, in our M&S segment and recognized goodwill of $\n64\nmillion associated with this acquisition.  Refer to Note 4—Business Combinations for additional information.\nIntangible Assets\nThe gross carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31 consisted of the following:\nThe net book value of our amortized intangible assets was $\n220\nmillion and $\n128\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, amortization expense was $\n33\nmillion, $\n27\nmillion and $\n26\nmillion, respectively, and is expected to be less than $\n35\nmillion per year in future years.\nIn August 2023, we acquired a marketing business on the U.S. West Coast, in our M&S segment and recorded additions of  $\n146\nmillion in amortized intangible assets.  Acquisitions of amortized intangible assets were\nnot\nmaterial in 2022.\n119\nNote 11—\nImpairments\nEquity Investments\nLiberty\nIn the first quarter of 2021, Phillips 66 Partners decided to exit the Liberty Pipeline project in our Midstream segment, which had previously been deferred due to the challenging business environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a result, Phillips 66 Partners recorded a $\n198\nmillion before-tax impairment to reduce the book value of its investment in Liberty at March 31, 2021, to estimated fair value.\nPP&E and Intangible Assets\nAlliance Refinery\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we identified impairment indicators related to our Alliance Refinery as a result of damages sustained from Hurricane Ida and our reassessment of the role this refinery would play in our refining portfolio.  Accordingly, we assessed the refinery asset group for impairment by performing an analysis that considered several usage scenarios, including selling or converting the asset group to an alternative use.  Based on our analysis, we concluded that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable.  As a result, we recorded a $\n1,298\nmillion before-tax impairment to reduce the carrying value of net PP&E in this asset group to its fair value of approximately $\n200\nmillion.  $\n1,288\nmillion of the impairment charge was recorded in our Refining segment and $\n10\nmillion was recorded in our Midstream segment.  In the fourth quarter of 2021, we shut down our Alliance Refinery.\nThese impairment charges are included within the “Impairments” line item on our consolidated income statement.  See Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, for additional information on the determination of fair value use to record these impairments.\n120\nNote 12—\nAsset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs\nAsset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December 31 were:\n* Classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet, under the caption “Other accruals.”\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe have asset retirement obligations that we are required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service.  Our recognized asset retirement obligations primarily involve asbestos abatement at our refineries; decommissioning, removal or dismantlement of certain assets at refineries that have or will be shut down; decommissioning, removal or dismantlement of certain midstream pipelines and processing facilities; and dismantlement or removal of assets at certain leased international marketing sites.  Most of our asset retirement obligations are not expected to be paid until many years in the future and are expected to be funded from general company resources at the time of removal.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our overall asset retirement obligation changed as follows:\n121\nAccrued Environmental Costs\nOf our total accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2023, $\n279\nmillion was primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations; $\n117\nmillion was associated with nonoperator sites; and $\n50\nmillion was related to sites at which we have been named a potentially responsible party under federal or state laws.  A large portion of our expected environmental expenditures have been discounted as these obligations were acquired in various business combinations.  Expected expenditures for acquired environmental obligations were discounted using a weighted-average discount rate of approximately\n5\n%.  At December 31, 2023, the accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities was $\n243\nmillion.  The expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs that have been discounted are: $\n24\nmillion in 2024, $\n18\nmillion in 2025, $\n20\nmillion in 2026, $\n17\nmillion in 2027, $\n16\nmillion in 2028, and $\n200\nmillion in the aggregate for all years after 2028.\nNote 13—\nEarnings Per Share\nThe numerator of basic earnings per share (EPS) is net income attributable to Phillips 66, adjusted for noncancelable dividends paid on unvested share-based employee awards during the vesting period (participating securities).  The denominator of basic EPS is the sum of the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented and fully vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been issued as common stock.  The numerator of diluted EPS is also based on net income attributable to Phillips 66, which is reduced by dividend equivalents paid on participating securities for which the dividends are more dilutive than the participation of the awards in the earnings of the periods presented.  To the extent unvested stock, unit or option awards and vested unexercised stock options are dilutive, they are included with the weighted-average common shares outstanding in the denominator.  Treasury stock is excluded from the denominator in both basic and diluted EPS.\n122\nNote 14—\nDebt\nShort-term and long-term debt at December 31 was:\n123\nMaturities of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023, inclusive of net unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, for each of the years from 2024 through 2028 are $\n1,482\nmillion, $\n1,999\nmillion, $\n2,253\nmillion, $\n1,276\nmillion and $\n1,313\nmillion, respectively.\n124\n2023 Activities\nDebt Repayments\nOn May 19, 2023, DCP LP redeemed its\n5.850\n% junior subordinated notes due May 2043 with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $\n550\nmillion.  On the date of redemption, our carrying value of DCP LP’s junior subordinated notes was $\n497\nmillion, which resulted in a $\n53\nmillion before-tax loss.  DCP LP’s junior subordinated notes were adjusted to fair value on August 17, 2022, in connection with the consolidation of DCP LP.  See Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, for additional information regarding the fair value of DCP LP’s junior subordinated notes.\nOn March 15, 2023, DCP LP repaid its\n3.875\n% senior unsecured notes due March 2023 with an aggregate principal amount of $\n500\nmillion.\nDebt Issuances\nOn March 29, 2023, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, issued $\n1.25\nbillion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of:\n•\n$\n750\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n4.950\n% Senior Notes due December 2027 (2027 Notes).\n•\n$\n500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n5.300\n% Senior Notes due June 2033 (2033 Notes).\nThe 2027 Notes and 2033 Notes (collectively, the Notes) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66.  Interest on the 2027 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year and commenced on December 1, 2023.  Interest on the 2033 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 30 of each year and commenced on December 30, 2023.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn March 27, 2023, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, entered into a $\n1.5\nbillion delayed draw term loan agreement guaranteed by Phillips 66 (the Term Loan Agreement).  The Term Loan Agreement provides for a single borrowing during a\n90-day\nperiod commencing on the closing date, which borrowing was contingent upon the completion of the DCP LP Merger.  The Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants similar to those contained in our revolving credit agreement, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of\n65\n% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  The Term Loan Agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts after grace periods; and violation of covenants.  We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.  Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at either: (a) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate plus the applicable margin, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement.  At December 31, 2023, $\n1.25\nbillion was borrowed under the Term Loan Agreement, which matures in June 2026.\nRelated Party Advance Term Loan Agreements\nBorrowings under related party Advance Term Loan agreements with WRB increased from $\n25\nmillion at December 31, 2022, to $\n290\nmillion at December 31, 2023.  Borrowings under these agreements are due in 2035 and 2038 and bear interest at a floating rate based on an adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable margin, payable on the last day of each month.\nSee Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, for additional information regarding the DCP LP Merger.\n125\n2022 Activities\nDebt Repayments\nIn December 2022, Phillips 66 repaid its\n3.700\n% senior notes due April 2023 with an aggregate principal amount of $\n500\nmillion.\nIn April 2022, upon maturity, Phillips 66 repaid its\n4.300\n% senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $\n1\nbillion and Phillips 66 Partners repaid its $\n450\nmillion term loan.\nDCP Midstream Class A Segment\nAs a result of the DCP Midstream Merger, we recorded the fair value of DCP Midstream Class A Segment’s debt to our consolidated balance sheet as of August 17, 2022.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, Note 4—Business Combinations, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, for additional information regarding the DCP Midstream Merger and the associated fair value measurements.  All of DCP Midstream Class A Segment’s debt is held by DCP LP.  Interest on all of DCP LP’s senior notes and junior subordinated notes is paid on a semi-annual basis.\nDebt Exchange\nOn May 5, 2022, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, completed offers to exchange (the Exchange Offers) all validly tendered notes of\nseven\ndifferent series of notes issued by Phillips 66 Partners (collectively, the Old Notes), with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $\n3.5\nbillion, for notes issued by Phillips 66 Company (collectively, the New Notes).  The New Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66 and rank equally with Phillips 66 Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and the guarantees rank equally with Phillips 66’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.\nOld Notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $\n3.2\nbillion were tendered in the Exchange Offers.  The New Notes have the same interest rates, interest payment dates and maturity dates as the Old Notes.  Holders that validly tendered before the end of the early participation period on April 19, 2022 (the Early Participation Date), received New Notes with an aggregate principal amount equivalent to the Old Notes, while holders that validly tendered after the Early Participation Date, but before the Expiration Date, received New Notes with an aggregate principal amount\n3\n% less than the Old Notes.  Substantially all of the Old Notes exchanged were tendered during the Early Participation Period.\nSubsequent Repayment\nOn February 15, 2024, upon maturity, Phillips 66 repaid its\n0.900\n% senior notes due February 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of $\n800\nmillion.\nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper\nPhillips 66 and Phillips 66 Company\nOn June 23, 2022, we entered into a $\n5\nbillion revolving credit facility (the Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor and a scheduled maturity date of June 22, 2027.  The Facility replaced our previous $\n5\nbillion revolving credit facility with Phillips 66 as the borrower and Phillips 66 Company as the guarantor.  The Facility contains usual and customary covenants that are similar to the previous revolving credit facility, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of\n65\n% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  We have the option to increase the overall capacity to $\n6\nbillion, subject to certain conditions.  We also have the option to extend the scheduled maturity of the Facility for up to\ntwo\nadditional\none-year\nterms, subject to, among other things, the consent of the lenders holding the majority of the commitments and of each lender extending its commitment.  Outstanding borrowings under the Facility bear interest at either (a) the adjusted term SOFR (as described in the Facility) in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate (as described in the Facility) plus the applicable margin.  The Facility also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees.  The pricing levels for the commitment fees and interest-rate margins are determined based on the ratings in effect for our senior unsecured long-term debt from time to time.  We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nno\namount had been drawn under the Facility.\n126\nPhillips 66 also has a $\n5\nbillion uncommitted commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by the Facility.  Commercial paper maturities are contractually limited to\n365\ndays.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nno\nborrowings were outstanding under the program.\nPhillips 66 Partners\nIn connection with entering into the Facility, we terminated Phillips 66 Partners’ $\n750\nmillion revolving credit facility.\nDCP Midstream Class A Segment\nDCP LP has a credit facility under its amended credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), with a borrowing capacity of up to $\n1.4\nbillion that matures on March 18, 2027.  The Credit Agreement grants DCP LP the option to increase the revolving loan commitment by an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n500\nmillion and to extend the term for up to\ntwo\nadditional\none-year\nperiods, subject to requisite lender approval.  Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement bears interest at either: (a) an adjusted SOFR (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin; or (b) the base rate (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin.  The Credit Agreement also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees.  The cost of borrowing under the Credit Agreement is determined by a ratings-based pricing grid based on DCP LP’s credit rating.  At December 31, 2023, DCP LP had $\n25\nmillion in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  At December 31, 2022, DCP LP had\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  At December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, $\n2\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion in letters of credit had been issued that are supported by the Credit Agreement.\nDCP LP has an accounts receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility) that provides for up to $\n350\nmillion of borrowing capacity through August 2024 at an adjusted SOFR and includes an uncommitted option to increase the total commitments under the Securitization Facility by up to an additional $\n400\nmillion.  Under the Securitization Facility, certain of DCP LP’s wholly owned subsidiaries sell or contribute receivables to another of DCP LP’s consolidated subsidiaries, DCP Receivables LLC, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity created for the sole purpose of the Securitization Facility.  At December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, $\n350\nmillion and $\n40\nmillion of borrowings were outstanding under the Securitization Facility, which are secured by accounts receivable at DCP Receivables LLC.\nAfter our consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment on August 17, 2022, DCP LP repaid $\n470\nmillion of borrowing under its accounts receivable securitization and revolving credit facilities that were outstanding on the acquisition date.\nTotal Committed Capacity Available\nAt December 31, 2023, and 2022, we had approximately $\n6.4\nbillion and $\n6.7\nbillion, respectively, of total committed capacity available under the credit facilities described above.\n127\nNote 15—\nGuarantees\nAt December 31, 2023, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below.  We recognize a liability for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees.  Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability either because the guarantees were issued prior to December 31, 2002, or because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial.  In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantees and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\nLease Residual Value Guarantees\nUnder the operating lease agreement for our headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, we have the option, at the end of the lease term in September 2025, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale.  We have a residual value guarantee associated with the operating lease agreement with a maximum potential future exposure of $\n514\nmillion at December 31, 2023.  We also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar, airplane and truck leases with maximum potential future exposures totaling $\n168\nmillion.  These leases have remaining terms of\none\nto\nten years\n.\nGuarantees of Joint Venture Obligations\nIn March 2019, Phillips 66 Partners and its co-venturers in Dakota Access provided a CECU in conjunction with a senior unsecured notes offering.  See Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional information regarding Dakota Access and the CECU.\nAt December 31, 2023, we also had other guarantees outstanding primarily for our portion of certain joint venture debt, which have remaining terms of up to\ntwo years\n.  The maximum potential future exposures under these guarantees were approximately $\n214\nmillion.  Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its obligations.\nIndemnifications\nOver the years, we have entered into various agreements to sell ownership interests in certain corporations, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to indemnifications.  Agreements associated with these sales include indemnifications for taxes, litigation, environmental liabilities, permits and licenses, employee claims, and real estate tenant defaults.  The provisions of these indemnifications vary greatly.  The majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, which generally have indefinite terms and potentially unlimited exposure.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of recorded indemnifications was $\n159\nmillion and $\n137\nmillion, respectively.\nWe amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of indemnity.  In cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information to support the reversal.  Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, environmental accruals for known contamination of $\n114\nmillion and $\n108\nmillion, respectively, were included in the carrying amount of the recorded indemnifications noted above.  These environmental accruals were primarily included in the “Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs” line item on our consolidated balance sheet.  For additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note 12—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs and Note 16—Contingencies and Commitments.\nIndemnification and Release Agreement\nIn 2012, in connection with our separation from ConocoPhillips, we entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement.  This agreement governs the treatment between ConocoPhillips and us of matters relating to indemnification, insurance, litigation responsibility and management, and litigation document sharing and cooperation arising in connection with the separation.  Generally, the agreement provides for cross indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of ConocoPhillips’ business with ConocoPhillips.  The agreement also establishes procedures for handling claims subject to indemnification and related matters.\n128\nNote 16—\nContingencies and Commitments\nA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us.  We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites.  We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies.  In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.  If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued.  We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries.  If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.  In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is uncertain.  See Note 23—Income Taxes, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.\nBased on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.  As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures.  Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters.  Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties.  Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.\nEnvironmental\nWe are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on management’s best estimates, using information available at the time.  We measure estimates and base contingent liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations.  When measuring contingent environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies’ cleanup experience, and data released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations.  We consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.\nAlthough liability for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, we are usually only one of many companies alleged to have liability at a particular site.  Due to such joint and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party.  We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies.  Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned.  Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.  In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability.  Where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly.  As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations.  Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit, although some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar and time limits.\nWe are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and comparable state sites.  After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those pertaining to sites acquired in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated.  We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries.  In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings.  See Note 12—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.\n129\nLegal Proceedings\nOur legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us.  Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation.  Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.\nOther Contingencies\nWe have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing arrangements.  Under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit and bank guarantees of $\n1,124\nmillion related to various purchase and other commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business.\nLong-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements\nWe have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of third-party financing arrangements.  The agreements typically provide for crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of our business.  At December 31, 2023, the estimated aggregate future payments under these agreements were $\n319\nmillion per year for each year from 2024 through 2028 and $\n692\nmillion in aggregate for all years after 2028.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, total payments under these agreements were $\n319\nmillion, $\n323\nmillion and $\n327\nmillion, respectively.\nNote 17—\nDerivatives and Financial Instruments\nDerivative Instruments\nWe use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to capture market opportunities.  Because we do not apply hedge accounting for commodity derivative contracts, all realized and unrealized gains and losses from commodity derivative contracts are recognized in our consolidated statement of income.  Gains and losses from derivative contracts held for trading not directly related to our physical business are reported net in the “Other income” line item on our consolidated statement of income.  Cash flows from all our derivative activity for the periods presented appear in the operating section on our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nPurchase and sales contracts with firm minimum notional volumes for commodities that are readily convertible to cash are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as derivatives unless the contracts are eligible for, and we elect, the normal purchases and normal sales exception, whereby the contracts are recorded on an accrual basis.  We generally apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception to eligible crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL, natural gas, renewable feedstock, and power commodity contracts to purchase or sell quantities we expect to use or sell in the normal course of business.  All other derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet.  For further information on the fair value of derivatives, see Note 18—Fair Value Measurements.\nCommodity Derivative Contracts\n—We sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL, natural gas, renewable feedstock, and electric power markets, exposing our revenues, purchases, cost of operating activities and cash flows to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities.  Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, we use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to balance physical systems, meet customer needs, manage price exposures on specific transactions, and do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business, all of which may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices.  We also use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades.\n130\nDCP Midstream Class A Segment\nThrough DCP LP’s operations, DCP Midstream Class A Segment is exposed to a variety of risks including but not limited to changes in the prices of commodities that DCP LP buys or sells.  The information below includes DCP LP’s financial instruments from the effective date of the DCP Midstream Merger.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, for additional information regarding the DCP Midstream Merger and the associated accounting treatment.\nThe following table indicates the consolidated balance sheet line items that include the fair values of commodity derivative assets and liabilities.  The balances in the following table are presented on a gross basis, before the effects of counterparty and collateral netting.  However, we have elected to present our commodity derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet when the legal right of offset exists.\nAt December 31, 2023, there was $\n7\nmillion of net collateral received that was not offset on our consolidated balance sheet.  At December 31, 2022, there was $\n93\nmillion of collateral paid that was not offset on our consolidated balance sheet.\nThe realized and unrealized gains (losses) incurred from commodity derivatives, and the line items where they appear on our consolidated statement of income, were:\nThe following table summarizes our material net exposures resulting from outstanding commodity derivative contracts.  These financial and physical derivative contracts are primarily used to manage price exposure on our underlying operations.  The underlying exposures may be from nonderivative positions such as inventory volumes.  Financial derivative contracts may also offset physical derivative contracts, such as forward purchase and sales contracts.  The percentage of our derivative contract volumes expiring within the next 12 months was more than\n90\n% at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n131\nCredit Risk from Derivative and Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts.\nOur trade receivables result primarily from the sale of products from, or related to, our refinery operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk.  The majority of these receivables have payment terms of\n30\ndays or less.  We continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties and recognize bad debt expense based on a probability assessment of credit loss.  Generally, we do not require collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments or master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us to others to be offset against amounts owed to us.\nThe credit risk from our derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty to the transaction.  Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance.  We also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin requirements, typically on a daily basis, until settled.\nCertain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount.  We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit ratings.  The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if our credit ratings fall below investment grade.  Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many contracts also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral.\nThe aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position were immaterial at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNote 18—\nFair Value Measurements\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nWe carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which we measure at the reporting date using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price), and disclose the quality of these fair values based on the valuation inputs used in these measurements under the following hierarchy:\n•\nLevel 1: Fair value measured with unadjusted quoted prices from an active market for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2: Fair value measured either with: (1) adjusted quoted prices from an active market for similar assets or liabilities; or (2) other valuation inputs that are directly or indirectly observable.\n•\nLevel 3: Fair value measured with unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement.\n132\nWe classify the fair value of an asset or liability based on the significance of its observable or unobservable inputs to the measurement.  However, the fair value of an asset or liability initially reported as Level 3 will be subsequently reported as Level 2 if the unobservable inputs become inconsequential to its measurement or corroborating market data becomes available.  Conversely, an asset or liability initially reported as Level 2 will be subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborating market data becomes unavailable.\nWe used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:\n•\nCash and cash equivalents\n—The carrying amount reported on our consolidated balance sheet approximates fair value.\n•\nAccounts and notes receivable\n—\nThe carrying amount reported on our consolidated balance sheet approximates fair value.\n•\nDerivative instruments\n—The fair value of our exchange-traded contracts is based on quoted market prices obtained from the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Intercontinental Exchange or other exchanges, and is reported as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.  When exchange-cleared contracts lack sufficient liquidity, or are valued using either adjusted exchange-provided prices or nonexchange quotes, we classify those contracts as Level 2 or Level 3 based on the degree to which inputs are observable.\nPhysical commodity forward purchase and sales contracts and over-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps are generally valued using forward quotes provided by brokers and price index developers, such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service. We corroborate these quotes with market data and classify the resulting fair values as Level 2.  When forward market prices are not available, we estimate fair value using the forward price of a similar commodity, adjusted for the difference in quality or location.  In certain less liquid markets or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available.  In these circumstances, physical commodity purchase and sales contracts and OTC swaps are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships among various commodities that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.  We classify these contracts as Level 3.  Physical and OTC commodity options are valued using industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.  The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the options are classified as Level 2 or 3.  We use a midmarket pricing convention (the midpoint between bid and ask prices).  When appropriate, valuations are adjusted to reflect credit considerations, generally based on available market evidence.\nWhen applicable, we determine the fair value of interest rate swaps based on observable market valuations for interest rate swaps that have notional amounts, terms and pay and reset frequencies similar to ours.\n•\nRabbi trust assets\n—These deferred compensation investments are measured at fair value using unadjusted quoted prices available from national securities exchanges and are therefore categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\n•\nInvestment in NOVONIX\n—Our investment in NOVONIX is measured at fair value using unadjusted quoted prices available from the Australian Securities Exchange and is therefore categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\n•\nOther investments\n—Includes other marketable securities with observable market prices.\n•\nDebt\n—The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates fair value.  The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is estimated primarily based on observable market prices.\nThe following tables display the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets and liabilities either accounted for or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis.  These values are determined by treating each contract as the fundamental unit of account; therefore, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are shown on a gross basis in the hierarchy sections of these tables, before the effects of counterparty and collateral netting.  The following tables also reflect the effect of netting derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty for which we have the legal right of offset and collateral netting.\n133\nThe carrying values and fair values by hierarchy of our financial assets and liabilities, either carried or disclosed at fair value, including any effects of counterparty and collateral netting, were:\nThe rabbi trust assets and investment in NOVONIX are recorded in the “Investments and long-term receivables” line item, and floating-rate and fixed-rate debt are recorded in the “Short-term debt” and “Long-term debt” line items on our consolidated balance sheet.  See Note 17—Derivatives and Financial Instruments, for information regarding where the assets and liabilities related to our commodity derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.\n134\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nEquity Investments\nIn the first quarter of 2021, Phillips 66 Partners wrote down the book value of its investment in Liberty to estimated fair value using a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement.  This nonrecurring measurement was based on the estimated fair value of Phillips 66 Partners’ share of the joint venture’s pipeline assets and net working capital at March 31, 2021.  See Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for more information regarding Phillips 66 Partners’ transfer of its ownership in Liberty to its co-venturer in April 2021.\nPP&E and Intangible Assets\nAlliance Refinery\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we remeasured the carrying value of the net PP&E of our Alliance Refinery asset group to fair value.  The fair value of PP&E was determined using a combination of the income, cost and sales comparison approaches.  The income approach used a discounted cash flow model that required various observable and non-observable inputs, such as commodity prices, margins, operating rates, sales volumes, operating expenses, capital expenditures, terminal-year values and a risk-adjusted discount rate.  The cost approach used assumptions for the current replacement costs of similar plant and equipment assets adjusted for estimated physical deterioration, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence.  The sales comparison approach used the value of similar properties recently sold or currently offered for sale.  This valuation resulted in a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement.\nDCP Midstream Merger\nOn August 17, 2022, we and Enbridge agreed to merge DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings with DCP Midstream as the surviving entity.  As a result, we began consolidating the financial results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills, and accordingly, accounted for the business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which required DCP Midstream Class A Segment’s, DCP Sand Hills’ and DCP Southern Hills’, assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date on our consolidated balance sheet.  See Note 4—Business Combinations, for additional information on the DCP Midstream Merger.\nEquity Method Investments\nThe fair value of the investments we acquired that are accounted for under the equity method was $\n2,034\nmillion.  The fair value of these assets was determined using the income approach.  The income approach used discounted cash flow models that require various observable and non-observable inputs, such as margins, tariffs and rates, utilization, volumes, product costs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, terminal-year values and risk-adjusted discount rates.  These valuations resulted in Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements.\nPP&E\nThe fair value of PP&E was $\n13,030\nmillion.  The fair value of these assets was determined primarily using the cost approach.  The cost approach used assumptions for the current replacement costs of similar plant and equipment assets adjusted for estimated physical deterioration, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence.  The fair value of properties was determined using a sales comparison approach.  These valuations resulted in Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements.\nDebt\nThe fair value of DCP LP’s senior and junior subordinated notes was measured using a market approach, based on the average of quotes for the acquired debt from major financial institutions.  These valuations resulted in Level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurements.\n135\nNoncontrolling Interests\nAs a result of our consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, the noncontrolling interests held in DCP Midstream Class A Segment were recorded at their fair values on the DCP Midstream Merger date.  These noncontrolling interests on the DCP Midstream Merger date primarily included Enbridge’s indirect economic interest in DCP LP, the public holders of DCP LP’s common units and the public holders of DCP LP’s preferred units.  The fair value of the noncontrolling interests in DCP LP’s common units was based on their unit market price as of the date of the DCP Midstream Merger, August 17, 2022.  The fair value of the noncontrolling interests in DCP LP’s publicly traded preferred units was based on their respective market price as of the date of the DCP Midstream Merger, August 17, 2022.  These valuations resulted in Level 1 nonrecurring fair value measurements.  The fair value of the noncontrolling interests in DCP LP’s other preferred units was based on an income approach that used projected distributions that were discounted using an average implied yield of DCP LP’s publicly traded preferred units and expected redemption dates.  This valuation resulted in a Level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurement.\nGains Related to DCP Midstream Merger\nIn connection with the DCP Midstream Merger, we recognized before-tax gains totaling $\n2,831\nmillion from remeasuring our previously held equity investments to their fair values and a before-tax gain of $\n182\nmillion related to the transfer of a\n35.75\n% indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline to our co-venturer.  The fair values of our previously held equity interest in DCP Midstream and the equity interest in Gray Oak Pipeline we transferred were primarily based on DCP LP’s publicly traded common unit market price on the effective date of the merger, August 17, 2022, the cash consideration contributed and obligations that were deemed to be effectively settled.  This valuation resulted in Level 1 nonrecurring fair value measurements.  The fair values of our previously held equity interests in DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills were determined using the income approach.  The income approach used discounted cash flow models that require various observable and non-observable inputs, such as tariffs, volumes, operating expenses, capital expenditures, terminal-year values and risk-adjusted discount rates.  These valuations resulted in Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements.\n136\nNote 19—\nEquity\nPreferred Stock\nPhillips 66 has\n500\nmillion shares of preferred stock authorized, with a par value of $\n0.01\nper share,\nnone\nof which have been issued.\nTreasury Stock\nOn October 25, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $\n5\nbillion increase to our share repurchase authorization.  Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2012, our Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate of $\n25\nbillion of repurchases of our outstanding common stock, and we have repurchased\n213.8\nmillion shares at an aggregate cost of $\n18\nbillion.  In 2023, we repurchased\n37.8\nmillion shares at an aggregate cost of $\n4\nbillion.  Our share repurchase authorizations do not expire.  Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on various factors including our share price, results of operations, financial condition and cash required for future business plans.  Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.\nOur Board of Directors separately authorized\ntwo\ntransactions in 2014 and 2018, which resulted in the repurchase of\n52.4\nmillion shares of Phillips 66 common stock with an aggregate value of $\n4.6\nbillion.\nIn March 2022, in connection with the Phillips 66 Partners merger, we issued\n41.8\nmillion shares of common stock from our treasury stock with an aggregate cost of $\n3.4\nbillion.  See Note 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, for information on the merger with Phillips 66 Partners.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nOn February 7, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n1.05\nper common share, payable March 1, 2024, to holders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2024.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nAt December 31, 2023, our noncontrolling interests primarily represented Enbridge’s indirect economic interest in DCP LP.  On June 15, 2023, as part of the DCP LP Merger, we acquired all publicly held common units of DCP LP and eliminated the public common unit noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements from the DCP LP Merger date, forward.  During 2023, DCP LP also redeemed its Series B and Series C preferred units.  See Note 29—DCP Midstream Class A Segment, for further information on the DCP LP Merger and preferred unit redemptions.\nAt December 31, 2022, our noncontrolling interests primarily represented Enbridge’s indirect economic interest in DCP LP, the public holders of DCP LP’s common units and the holders of DCP LP’s Series B and Series C preferred units.  In December 2022, DCP LP redeemed its Series A preferred units.  In March 2022, we completed a merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners, which resulted in the acquisition of all limited partnership interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us.  See Note 29—DCP Midstream Class A Segment, for further information on the preferred unit redemption.  See\nNote 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, for further information on the merger with Phillips 66 Partners.\n137\nNote 20—\nLeases\nWe lease marine vessels, pipelines, storage tanks, railcars, service station sites, office buildings, corporate aircraft, land and other facilities and equipment.  In determining whether an agreement contains a lease, we consider our ability to control the asset and whether third-party participation or vendor substitution rights limit our control.  Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options and/or options to purchase the leased property.  Renewal options have been included only when reasonably certain of exercise.  There are no significant restrictions imposed on us in our lease agreements with regards to dividend payments, asset dispositions or borrowing ability.  Certain leases have residual value guarantees, which may require additional payments at the end of the lease term if future fair values decline below contractual lease balances.\nWe discount lease obligations using our incremental borrowing rate.  We separate costs for lease and service components for contracts involving marine vessels and consignment service stations.  For these contracts, we allocate the consideration payable between the lease and service components using the relative standalone prices of each component.  For contracts involving all other asset types, we account for the lease and service components on a combined basis.  For short-term leases, which are leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, we do not recognize the right-of-use (ROU) asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet.\nThe following table indicates the consolidated balance sheet line items that include the ROU assets and lease liabilities for our finance and operating leases at December 31:\n138\nFuture minimum lease payments at December 31, 2023, for finance and operating lease liabilities were:\nOur finance lease liabilities relate primarily to service station consignment agreements with a marketing joint venture and a crude oil terminal in the United Kingdom.  The lease liability for the terminal finance lease is subject to foreign currency translation adjustments each reporting period.\nComponents of net lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of our lease liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, was:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded noncash ROU assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities totaling $\n398\nmillion, $\n269\nmillion and $\n260\nmillion, respectively, related to new and modified lease agreements.\n139\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease terms and discount rates for our lease liabilities were:\nNote 21—\nPension and Postretirement Plans\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the projected benefit obligations and plan assets for our pension plans and accumulated benefit obligations for our other postretirement benefit plans:\n140\nAmounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31 include:\nIncluded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31 were the following before-tax amounts that had not been recognized in net periodic benefit cost:\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income (loss):\nThe accumulated benefit obligations for all U.S. and international pension plans were $\n2,101\nmillion and $\n661\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2023, and $\n2,055\nmillion and $\n593\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2022.\n141\nInformation for U.S. and international pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at December 31 was:\nInformation for U.S. and international pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at December 31 was:\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost for all defined benefit plans are presented in the table below:\n* Included in the “Operating expenses” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line items on our consolidated statement of income.\n142\nIn determining net periodic benefit cost, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.  For net actuarial gains and losses, we amortize\n10\n% of the unamortized balance each year.  The amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31:\nFor both U.S. and international pension plans, the overall expected long-term rate of return is developed from the expected future return of each asset class, weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class.  We rely on a variety of independent market forecasts in developing the expected rate of return for each class of assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, actuarial losses resulted in increases in our U.S. and international pension benefit obligations of $\n58\nmillion and $\n30\nmillion, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, actuarial gains resulted in decreases in our U.S. and international pension benefit obligations of $\n528\nmillion and $\n502\nmillion, respectively.  The primary driver for the actuarial losses in 2023 was decreases in the discount rates.  The primary driver for the actuarial gains in 2022 was increases in the discount rates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the weighted-average actual return on plan assets was\n10\n%, which resulted in an increase in our U.S. and international plan assets of $\n203\nmillion and $\n44\nmillion, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the weighted-average actual return on plan assets was negative\n20\n%, which resulted in a decrease in our U.S. and international plan assets of $\n375\nmillion and $\n329\nmillion, respectively.  The primary driver of the return on plan assets in 2023 and 2022 was fluctuations in the equity and fixed income markets.\nOur other postretirement benefit plans for health insurance are contributory.  Effective December 31, 2012, we terminated the subsidy for retiree medical plans.  Since January 1, 2013, eligible employees have been able to utilize notional amounts credited to an account during their period of service with the company to pay all, or a portion, of their cost to participate in postretirement health insurance.  In general, employees hired after December 31, 2012, will not receive credits to an account, but will have unsubsidized access to health insurance through the plan.  The cost of health insurance will be adjusted annually by the company’s actuary to reflect actual experience and expected health care cost trends.  The measurement of the accumulated benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of\n7\n% in 2024 that declines to\n5\n% by 2031.\n143\nPlan Assets\nThe investment strategy for managing pension plan assets is to seek a reasonable rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk and provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management.  We follow a policy of diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes, investment managers, and individual holdings.  As a result, our plan assets have no significant concentrations of credit risk.  Asset classes that are considered appropriate include equities, fixed income, cash, real estate and infrastructure investments and insurance contracts.  Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the investment program from time to time.  The target allocations for plan assets are approximately\n47\n% equity securities,\n37\n% debt securities,\n8\n% real estate investments and\n8\n% in all other types of investments as of December 31, 2023.  Generally, the investments in the plans are publicly traded, therefore minimizing the liquidity risk in the portfolio.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets.\n•\nFair values of equity securities and government debt securities are based on quoted market prices.\n•\nFair values of corporate debt securities are estimated using recently executed transactions and market price quotations.  If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices.\n•\nFair values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their carrying amounts.\n•\nFair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance company to the plans’ participants.\n•\nFair values of investments in common/collective trusts (CCT) and real estate and infrastructure investments, which include a CCT, limited partnerships, and other real estate funds, are valued at the net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient.  The NAV is based on the underlying net assets owned by the fund and the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets.  These investments valued at NAV are not classified within the fair value hierarchy, but are presented in the fair value table to permit reconciliation of total plan assets to the amounts presented in the fair value table.\nThe fair values of our pension plan assets at December 31, by asset class, were:\n144\nOur funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Contributions to international plans are subject to local laws and tax regulations.  Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan asset returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments, and other economic factors.  In 2024, we expect to contribute approximately $\n75\nmillion to our U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans and $\n5\nmillion to our international pension plans.\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid to plan participants in the years indicated:\nDefined Contribution Plans\nMost U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Phillips 66 Savings Plan (Savings Plan).  Employees can contribute up to\n75\n% of their eligible pay, subject to certain statutory limits, in the Savings Plan to a choice of investment funds.  For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Phillips 66 provided a company match of participant contributions up to\n8\n% of eligible pay, with an additional Success Share contribution ranging from\n0\n% to\n4\n% of eligible pay based on management discretion.  For the year ended December 31, 2021, Phillips 66 provided a company match of participant contributions up to\n6\n% of eligible pay, with an additional Success Share contribution ranging from\n0\n% to\n6\n% of eligible pay based on management discretion.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded expense of $\n196\nmillion, $\n210\nmillion and $\n142\nmillion, respectively, related to our contributions to the Savings Plan.\n145\nNote 22—\nShare-Based Compensation Plans\nShare-based payment awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards (including restricted stock and RSU awards), cash awards, and performance awards, are granted to our employees, nonemployee directors and other plan participants by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC) of our Board of Directors under the applicable Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of Phillips 66.  Prior to May 11, 2022, share-based payment awards were granted under the 2013 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of Phillips 66 (the 2013 P66 Omnibus Plan).  On May 11, 2022, Phillips 66’s shareholders approved the 2022 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of Phillips 66 (the 2022 P66 Omnibus Plan), which replaced the 2013 P66 Omnibus Plan.  No future awards will be made under the 2013 P66 Omnibus Plan.  As of December 31, 2023, approximately\n13\nmillion shares of Phillips 66’s common stock remained available to be issued to settle share-based payment awards under the 2022 P66 Omnibus Plan.\nTotal share-based compensation expense recognized in income and the associated income tax benefit for the years ended December 31 were:\n146\nRestricted Stock Units\nGenerally, RSUs are granted annually under the provisions of the applicable Phillips 66 incentive plan, and vest either ratably over\nthree years\nfollowing the grant date or cliff vest at the end of\nthree years\nfor awards granted in 2023.  For awards granted prior to 2023, RSUs cliff vest at the end of\nthree years\n.  The grant date fair value is equal to the average of the high and low market price of our stock on the grant date.  The recipients receive a quarterly dividend equivalent cash payment until the RSU is settled by issuing\none\nshare of our common stock for each RSU at the end of the service period.  RSUs granted to retirement-eligible employees are not subject to forfeiture\nten months\nafter the grant date for RSUs granted in 2023 and\nsix months\nafter the grant date for RSUs granted prior to 2023.  Special RSUs are granted to attract or retain key personnel and the terms and conditions may vary by award.\nThe following table summarizes our RSU activity from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023:\nAt December 31, 2023, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested RSU awards was $\n92\nmillion, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n18\nmonths, the longest period being\n35\nmonths.\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we granted RSUs with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $\n88.16\nand $\n75.91\n, respectively.  During 2022 and 2021, we issued shares with an aggregate fair value of $\n102\nmillion and $\n61\nmillion, respectively, to settle RSUs.\nPerformance Share Units\nUnder the applicable Phillips 66 incentive plan, senior management is annually awarded restricted performance share units (PSUs) with\nthree-year\nperformance periods.  These awards vest when the HRCC approves the\nthree-year\nperformance results, which represents the grant date.  Retirement-eligible employees may retain a prorated share of the award if they retire prior to the grant date.  PSUs are classified as liability awards and compensation expense is recognized over the\nthree-year\nperformance periods.\nPSUs granted under the applicable Phillips 66 incentive plan are settled by cash payments equal to the fair value of the awards, which is based on the market prices of our stock near the end of the performance periods.  The HRCC must approve the\nthree-year\nperformance results prior to payout.  Dividend equivalents are not paid on these awards.\nPSUs granted under prior incentive compensation plans were classified as equity awards.  These equity awards are settled upon an employee’s retirement by issuing\none\nshare of our common stock for each PSU held.  Dividend equivalents are paid on these awards.\n147\nThe following table summarizes our PSU activity from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023:\nAt December 31, 2023, there was\nno\nremaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested PSU awards.\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we granted PSUs with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $\n71.82\nand $\n68.18\n, respectively.  During 2022 and 2021, we issued shares with an aggregate fair value of $\n9\nmillion and $\n12\nmillion, respectively, to settle PSUs.  During 2022 and 2021, we cash settled PSUs with an aggregate fair value of $\n18\nmillion and $\n27\nmillion, respectively.\nStock Options\nStock options granted under the provisions of the applicable Phillips 66 incentive plan and earlier plans permit purchases of our common stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average of the high and low market price of our stock on the date the options were granted.  The options have terms of\n10\nyears and vest ratably over\nthree years\nfollowing the grant date, with one-third of the options becoming exercisable each year on the grant date anniversary.  Options granted to retirement-eligible employees are not subject to forfeiture\nten months\nafter the grant date for options granted in 2023 and\nsix months\nafter the grant date for options granted prior to 2023.\nThe following table summarizes our stock option activity from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023:\n148\nThe weighted-average remaining contractual terms of vested options and exercisable options at December 31, 2023, were\n6.37\nyears and\n5.6\nyears, respectively.  During 2023, we received $\n123\nmillion in cash and realized an income tax benefit of $\n12\nmillion from the exercise of options.  At December 31, 2023, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from unvested options was $\n6\nmillion, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n21\nmonths, the longest period being\n30\nmonths.\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we granted options with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $\n17.02\nand $\n12.06\n, respectively.  During 2022 and 2021, employees exercised options with an aggregate intrinsic value of $\n42\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion, respectively.\nThe following table provides the significant assumptions used to calculate the grant-date fair values of options granted over the years shown below, as calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model:\nWe calculate the volatility factor using historical Phillips 66 end-of-week closing stock prices.  We periodically calculate the average period of time elapsed between grant dates and exercise dates of past grants to estimate the expected life of new option grants.\nOther\nAs a result of the DCP Midstream Merger, we began consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment starting on August 18, 2022.\nDCP Midstream Class A Segment had a Long-Term Incentive Plan under which phantom units, performance units and distribution equivalent rights were awarded to key employees.  On June 15, 2023, DCP Midstream Class A Segment’s share-based payment awards were converted to Phillips 66 share-based payment awards and are included in the share-based payment award tables above.  Share-based compensation expense recognized for DCP Midstream Class A Segment’s share-based payment awards totaled $\n23\nmillion for the period from August 18, 2022, through December 31, 2022, and $\n6\nmillion for the period from January 1, 2023, through June 14, 2023.\nSee Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers and Note 4—Business Combinations for additional information regarding the merger and associated accounting treatment.\n149\nNote 23—\nIncome Taxes\nComponents of income tax expense (benefit) were:\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) that includes, among other provisions, changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a 15% minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income as defined in the IRA, which was effective after December 31, 2022.  We do not owe corporate alternative minimum tax in 2023 as the regular U.S. tax liability exceeds the corporate alternative minimum tax.  The IRA also included provisions that allow a company to purchase transferable tax credits.  In 2023, we executed agreements to purchase eligible tax credits for a total of $\n262\nmillion.  In 2023, we paid $\n196\nmillion to our counterparties and the remainder will be paid in 2024.  These tax credits were used to offset estimated tax payments in 2023.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.\nMajor components of deferred tax liabilities and assets at December 31 were:\n150\nAt December 31, 2023, the loss and credit carryforward deferred tax assets were primarily related to a foreign tax credit carryforward in the United States of $\n113\nmillion; a state tax net operating loss carryforward of $\n30\nmillion; and capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards in the United Kingdom of $\n8\nmillion.  State net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2040.  Foreign tax credit carryforwards, which have a full valuation allowance against them, begin to expire in 2029.  The other loss and credit carryforwards, all of which relate to foreign operations, and have a full valuation allowance against them, have indefinite lives.\nValuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, our total valuation allowance balance increased by $\n24\nmillion.  Based on our historical taxable income, expectations for the future and available tax planning strategies, management expects the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and the tax consequences of future taxable income.\nEarnings of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint ventures after December 31, 2017, are generally not subject to incremental income taxes in the United States or withholding taxes in foreign countries upon repatriation.  As such, we only assert that the earnings of one of our foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested.  At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the unrecorded deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings of this foreign subsidiary was not material.\nA deferred income tax liability has not been recognized on the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of an investment in a controlled foreign subsidiary that is essentially permanent in duration.  Recognition of a deferred tax liability will only be required if it becomes apparent that this subsidiary will be sold or liquidated in the foreseeable future.  At December 31, 2023, the temporary difference resulting from the investment book basis exceeding the tax basis was $\n1,430\nmillion.  Determination of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to this temporary difference is not practicable given the variables involved in performing such a calculation.\nWe file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and state jurisdictions.  Unrecognized tax benefits reflect the difference between positions taken on income tax returns and the amounts recognized in the financial statements.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the changes in our unrecognized income tax benefits balance:\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized income tax benefits at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were $\n100\nmillion, $\n37\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion, respectively, which, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate.  With respect to various unrecognized income tax benefits and the related accrued liabilities, we expect $\n28\nmillion to be recognized or paid within the next twelve months.\nAt December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, accrued liabilities for interest and penalties, net of accrued income taxes, totaled $\n8\nmillion, $\n7\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion, respectively.  These accruals decreased our results for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 by $\n1\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion, respectively.\n151\nAudits in significant jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: United Kingdom (2021), Germany (2017) and United States (2013).  Certain issues remain in dispute for audited years, and unrecognized income tax benefits for years still subject to or currently undergoing an audit are subject to change.  As a consequence, the balance in unrecognized income tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period.  Although it is reasonably possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized income tax benefits, the amount of change is not estimable.\nThe amounts of U.S. and foreign income before income taxes, with a reconciliation of income tax at the federal statutory rate to the recorded income tax expense (benefit), were:\n* Other includes individually immaterial items but is primarily attributable to foreign operations and change in valuation allowance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, state income tax, net of federal income tax benefit, includes a $\n58\nmillion benefit, primarily to reflect the impact of updated apportionment factors.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, income tax benefits of $\n113\nmillion and $\n323\nmillion, respectively, are reflected in “Capital in Excess of Par” on the consolidated statement of changes in equity.  There is\nno\nincome tax reflected in “Capital in Excess of Par” for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n152\nNote 24—\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nChanges in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows:\n* Included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost.

We also sold certain feedstocks and intermediate products to WRB and acted as an agent for WRB in supplying crude oil and other feedstocks for a fee.  In addition, we charged several of our equity affiliates, including CPChem, for the use of common facilities, such as steam generators, waste and water treaters and warehouse facilities.\n(b)\nWe purchased crude oil, refined petroleum products, NGL and solvents from WRB.  We also purchased natural gas and NGL from DCP Midstream and CPChem, as well as other feedstocks from various equity affiliates, for use in our refinery and fractionation processes.  In addition, we purchased base oils and fuel products from Excel Paralubes for use in our specialty and refining businesses.  We paid NGL fractionation fees to CPChem.  We also paid fees to various pipeline equity affiliates for transporting crude oil, refined petroleum products and NGL.\n(c)\nWe paid consignment fees to CF United, and utility and processing fees to various equity affiliates.\n(d)\nAs a result of the DCP Midstream Merger, we began consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills.

As a result of the DCP Midstream Merger on August 17, 2022, we began consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment, as well as DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers.  This segment also includes our\n16\n% investment in NOVONIX.\n2)\nChemicals—\nConsists of our\n50\n% equity investment in CPChem, which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis.\n3)\nRefining—\nRefines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, as well as renewable fuels.

DCP Midstream Class A Segment is comprised of the businesses, activities, assets and liabilities of DCP LP and its subsidiaries and its general partner entities.  Refer to Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers and Note 4—Business Combinations, for more details regarding the DCP Midstream Merger and related accounting.\nDCP LP is a master limited partnership whose operations currently include producing and fractionating NGL, gathering, compressing, treating and processing natural gas; recovering condensate; and transporting, trading, marketing and storing natural gas and NGL.\nAs a result of the DCP Midstream Merger, we began consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment from the merger date forward, and we reflected the interests held by DCP LP’s public common and preferred unitholders’ and Enbridge’s indirect economic interest in DCP LP at the time of the merger as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements.  On June 15, 2023, as part of the DCP LP Merger, we acquired all publicly held common units of DCP LP and eliminated the public common unit noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements from the DCP LP Merger date, forward.  The DCP LP Merger increased our aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in DCP LP from\n43.3\n% to\n86.8\n%.  See below and Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, for additional information about the DCP Midstream and DCP LP Mergers, as well as information on preferred unit redemptions that also decreased the “Noncontrolling interests” balance on our consolidated balance sheet since December 31, 2022.\n159\nThe most significant assets of DCP Midstream Class A Segment that are available to settle only its obligations, along with its most significant liabilities for which its creditors do not have recourse to Phillips 66’s general credit, were:\n* Included in the “Accounts and notes receivable” line item on the Phillips 66 consolidated balance sheet.\n** Included in the “Investments and long-term receivables” line item on the Phillips 66 consolidated balance sheet.\nDCP LP Merger\nOn June 15, 2023, we completed the acquisition of approximately\n91\nmillion publicly held common units of DCP LP pursuant to the terms of the DCP LP Merger Agreement.  The DCP LP Merger Agreement was entered into with DCP LP, its subsidiaries and its general partner entities, pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries merged with and into DCP LP, with DCP LP surviving as a Delaware limited partnership.  Under the terms of the DCP LP Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the DCP LP Merger, each publicly held common unit representing a limited partner interest in DCP LP (other than the common units owned by DCP Midstream and its subsidiaries) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time was converted into the right to receive $\n41.75\nper common unit in cash.  We paid $\n3,796\nmillion in cash consideration to common unitholders, funded with a combination of available cash and proceeds from the offering of the Notes and borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement.  See Note 11—Debt, for additional information.\nThe DCP LP Merger was accounted for as an equity transaction and resulted in decreases to “Cash and cash equivalents” of $\n3,814\nmillion, which includes cash consideration paid to common unitholders of $\n3,796\nmillion plus fees paid of $\n18\nmillion, “Noncontrolling interests” of $\n3,343\nmillion, “Capital in excess of par” of $\n361\nmillion and “Deferred income taxes” of $\n110\nmillion on our consolidated balance sheet.\nPreferred Units\nOn October 16, 2023, DCP LP redeemed its Series C preferred units at the aggregated liquidation preference of $\n110\nmillion, which approximated the book value of the preferred units.  In June 2023, DCP LP redeemed its Series B preferred units at the aggregated liquidation preference of $\n161\nmillion, which approximated the book value of the preferred units.  In December 2022, DCP LP redeemed its Series A preferred units with an aggregate liquidation preference of $\n500\nmillion, which approximated the book value of the preferred units.\nTrading and Reporting Status\nDCP LP’s common units, Series B preferred units and Series C preferred units have been delisted and deregistered from the New York Stock Exchange.  In addition, DCP LP has suspended its reporting obligations to the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\nDistributions\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, DCP LP made cash distributions of $\n125\nmillion and $\n51\nmillion, respectively, to common unitholders other than Phillips 66 and its subsidiaries, and $\n15\nmillion and $\n27\nmillion, respectively, to preferred unitholders.\n160\nNote 30—\nPhillips 66 Partners LP\nOn March 9, 2022, we completed a merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners.  The merger resulted in the acquisition of all limited partnership interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us in exchange for\n41.8\nmillion shares of Phillips 66 common stock issued from treasury stock.  Phillips 66 Partners common unitholders received\n0.50\nshares of Phillips 66 common stock for each outstanding Phillips 66 Partners common unit.  Phillips 66 Partners’ perpetual convertible preferred units were converted into common units at a premium to the original issuance price prior to being exchanged for Phillips 66 common stock.  Upon closing, Phillips 66 Partners became a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 and its common units are no longer publicly traded.\nThe merger was accounted for as an equity transaction and resulted in decreases to “Treasury stock” of $\n3,380\nmillion, “Noncontrolling interests” of $\n2,163\nmillion, “Capital in excess of par” of $\n901\nmillion, “Deferred income taxes” of $\n323\nmillion, and “Cash and cash equivalents” of $\n2\nmillion, and an increase to “Other accruals” of $\n5\nmillion on our consolidated balance sheet.\nNote 31—\nRestructuring\nIn April 2022, we announced that we are progressing a multi-year business transformation focused on enterprise-wide opportunities to improve our cost structure.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, we recorded restructuring costs totaling $\n177\nmillion and $\n160\nmillion, respectively, primarily related to consulting fees and severance costs. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2022, also included an impairment related to assets held for sale.  These costs are primarily recorded in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” and “Impairments” line items on our consolidated statement of income and are reported in our Corporate segment.\nIn addition, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded restructuring costs of $\n38\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively, associated with the integration of DCP Midstream Class A Segment primarily related to severance and contract exit costs.  These costs are primarily recorded in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line item on our consolidated statement of income and are reported in our Midstream segment.\nNote 32—\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740) – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which enhances the transparency, effectiveness, and comparability of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information related to income tax rate reconciliations and the jurisdictions in which income taxes are paid.  This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We are evaluating the provisions of ASU 2023-09 and the impact on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.”  This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We are evaluating the provisions of ASU 2023-07 and the impact on our segment reporting disclosures.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, “Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.”  This ASU provides additional requirements for lessees that are a party to a lease between entities under common control in which there are leasehold improvements.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  Effective January 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-01.  At the time of adoption, there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements from this ASU.\n161"
