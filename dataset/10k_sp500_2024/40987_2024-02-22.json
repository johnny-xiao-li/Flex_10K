    "text": "Incorporated in the State of Georgia in 1928, Genuine Parts Company is a global service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive and industrial replacement parts. We serve our customers from more than 10,700 locations, primarily in North America, Europe, as well as Australia and New Zealand (\"Australasia\"). We offer outstanding service, an industry-leading assortment of replacement parts, extensive supply chain and distribution capabilities, and enhanced technology solutions.\nAs used in this report, \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"GPC,\" and the “company” refers to GPC and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated by the context; and the terms “automotive parts” and “industrial parts” refer to replacement parts in each respective category.\nOUR PURPOSE & STRATEGY\nWe keep the world moving — this is our purpose and the foundation for how we do business. We are one global team unified by our mission to be an employer of choice, supplier of choice, valued customer, responsible corporate citizen and investment of choice for our shareholders. We strive to be a respected community member that gives back to the communities in which we operate. In order to execute this mission, we align our resources with strategic areas of focus for our operations. We focus on our market-leading automotive and industrial businesses to deliver profitable growth, operational efficiencies and strong cash flow.\nWe are organized into two business segments: our Automotive Parts Group (“Automotive”) and our Industrial Parts Group (“Industrial”). In the automotive landscape, we see a positive long-term growth outlook across the markets we serve supported by an increase in miles driven, a growing and aging car parc, increasing vehicle complexity, and a growing opportunity with electric vehicles. In the industrial landscape, we see disruptions in the global supply chain creating opportunities with nearshoring, a strong outlook for automation and robotics solutions, the need for industrial expertise due to an aging technical workforce and diversified end market opportunities. Our business segments create a competitive differentiation in two distinct and growing markets with compelling shareholder value.\nWe believe our primary competitive advantages are our: (1) global presence and brand strength; (2) industry-leading positions in two distinct, but complementary markets; (3) extensive supply chain and distribution capabilities; and (4) enhanced technology solutions.\nOur strategic financial objectives complement our mission and drive value for all our stakeholders. These financial objectives include: (1) revenue growth in excess of market growth; (2) continuously improving operating margins; (3) maintaining a strong balance sheet and cash flows; and (4) effective capital allocation. Our strategy is designed to position us for long-term profitable growth and enhance shareholder value.\nOUR SEGMENTS\nAUTOMOTIVE\nOur Automotive segment, which represents approximately 62% of total GPC net sales, is the largest global automotive network of parts and care. We distribute automotive parts, accessories and solutions in North America, Europe and Australasia. Our Automotive businesses offer complete inventory, cataloging, marketing, training and other programs to the aftermarket in each of these regions, distinguishing our business from the competition.\nOur global Automotive network sells to customers in both commercial do-it-for-me (“DIFM”) and retail do-it-yourself (“DIY”) segments of the market and covers substantially all global motor vehicle models. Our DIFM customers include local, regional and national repair centers, auto dealers, service stations and both private and public sector accounts. Our DIY customers are primarily served over-the-counter at our global stores or digitally. Our DIFM and DIY customers represent approximately 80% and 20% of total Automotive sales, respectively, and channel mix varies by geography.\nOur Automotive network consists of over one million customer locations, including installers, fleet, government, and major accounts. We have diversity amongst our customer base with no specific customer type representing an outsized concentration of our customer business. Our Automotive segment operates in a large and fragmented market with a total addressable market greater than $200 billion. The majority of the automotive aftermarket is comprised of small, local competitors which creates an opportunity to actively pursue strategic acquisitions and bolt-on store groups where we can bring scale, advanced technology, and supply chain efficiency to differentiate ourselves from competitors.\n2\nOur Automotive distribution network provides access to hundreds of thousands of replacement parts (other than body parts and tires) and accessory items for substantially all motor vehicle makes and models, including hybrid and electric vehicles, trucks, SUVs, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, and for small engines, farm equipment, marine equipment and heavy duty equipment. We supply certain equipment and parts used by repair shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation.\nAvailability is a critical success factor in our business and our teams utilize data and analytics to have the right parts, in the right place and at the right time. The majority of products distributed in North America are under the NAPA name, a mark licensed to us by NAPA, which is important to the sales and marketing of these products. In Australasia and Europe, products are distributed under several brand names, including many of the national brands, as well as the NAPA name. Our Automotive operations have access to approximately 800,000 different parts and related supply items.These items are purchased from hundreds of different suppliers, with approximately 46% of 2023 automotive parts inventories purchased from 10 major suppliers.\nRegional Operations & Products.\nIn North America, our U.S. operations are headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and our Canadian operations are headquartered in Montreal, Quebec. We distribute the majority of products in the U.S. and Canada under the NAPA name, which is important to our sales and marketing efforts. We go to market in North America primarily through company-owned and independent auto part stores, heavy vehicle stores, and specialty paint and equipment stores. Our North American auto parts stores sell a comprehensive range of automotive parts, including brakes, batteries, filters, engine components, tools, accessories, and fluids. Some locations offer custom services such as paint mixing, hydraulic hose assembly, battery testing, and key cutting. Our heavy vehicle stores sell parts, accessories, tools and equipment for servicing heavy duty and diesel vehicles, and we operate service and mechanical repair centers for heavy vehicles. We serve the heavy vehicle market under the banners Traction, TruckPro, TW, and Cadel. In Canada, our specialty stores operate paint and body care equipment and supply under the banner NAPA/CMAX and high-quality replacement parts and lubricants for imported vehicles under the banners Altrom and Auto‑Camping. Our online service in North America, NAPA online, provides a platform for customers to browse, purchase, and have automotive products delivered to their homes or businesses. Separately, we provide a NAPA Auto Care program across the U.S. and Canada for independent repair shop centers to increase visibility and receive part discounts and other benefits. We offer technical expertise by training and employing knowledgeable staff who can provide technical assistance, product recommendations, and guidance on automotive repairs and maintenance, and we organize DIY workshops and training sessions to educate customers on automotive repair and maintenance tasks.\nWe believe that the quality and the range of services provided to our North American automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for our automotive parts distribution system. Our goal is to properly stock our locations with the right parts to ensure we provide quick and quality service to our customers whose orders are often filled and shipped the same day they are received. Our services also include up to date parts cataloging (including the use of electronic NAPA Auto Parts catalogs) and stock adjustments through a continuous parts classification system which, as initiated by us, allows independently-owned stores to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. We offer our NAPA Auto Parts stores various management aids, marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs. We have developed and refined an inventory classification system to determine the most advantageous distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological advances, including predictive analytics, and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous analytical review, is an integral part of our inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management services that we make available to our NAPA Auto Parts stores. Losses from inventory obsolescence have not been significant historically and we attribute this to the successful operation of our classification system, which includes product return privileges with most of our suppliers.\nIn Europe, we operate Alliance Automotive Group (“AAG”), headquartered in London, England. Europe is predominantly a DIFM market, with very few over-the-counter sales. We serve thousands of vehicle repairers, body shops and auto-centers from over 2,000 distributor outlets across Europe, supported by a logistics infrastructure of national and regional distribution centers. Our distributor outlets include company-owned and independent auto part stores and outlets, heavy vehicle outlets, and online and specialty outlets. Our European banners include Groupauto, Precisium and Pièces Auto in France; Coler, Busch, Hennig and Knoll in Germany; Groupauto, UAN, FPS Distribution, APEC Braking, BTN Turbo, Platinum International, Alliance Automotive U.K. Subsidiaries, and J&S Automotive Distributors in the U.K. and Republic of Ireland; PartsPoint in Belgium and the Netherlands; Lausan, Soulima and Gaudi in Spain and Portugal; and GroupAuto in Poland. In France, we also provide parts and services for heavy duty and diesel vehicles under the Todd banner and we operate Back2Car, which distributes recycled car\n3\nparts. In the Netherlands and Belgium, we offer programs for repair shops that want to join our installer network to increase their visibility and brand awareness while remaining independent. Separately in Europe, we operate WinParts, an online platform for customers to browse, purchase, and have automotive products delivered to their homes or businesses.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, we operate GPC Asia Pacific – the region’s largest automotive aftermarket parts supplier. We resell and distribute automotive replacement parts, accessories and related tools and equipment through a network of company-owned retail stores and advanced distribution centers. GPC Asia Pacific operates three main lines of business: Automotive Australia, Automotive New Zealand and Two Wheel Division. Automotive Australia and Automotive New Zealand operate our auto parts stores in Australia and New Zealand under two banners: (i) Repco, which operates a nationwide dual-format store network across both countries, providing parts, equipment, tools, batteries, technology, and oil to both trade and retail customers, and (ii) NAPA Auto Parts, which offers automotive electrical and mechanical parts to trade, fleet, industrial, commercial and mining specialist customers. Both Repco and NAPA compliment their network with the market's leading digital capability, providing our customers with a seamless omni-channel transactional capability. Our Two Wheel Division wholesales and retails motorcycle parts, apparel and accessories, with the market's leading range of the world’s most respected motorcycle brands, many of which are supplied under exclusive distribution agreements. Two Wheel Division operates two wholesale banners (McLeod Accessories and John Titman Racing), and also operates Australia's largest and fastest growing motorcycle accessories and apparel retailer (AMX Super Stores). GPC Asia Pacific also operates a number of direct-to-consumer digital businesses, including Sparesbox, STEDI and 4WD247.\nDistribution Network.\nOur independently-owned and company-owned stores located in every region are sourced by our distribution networks. Both types of automotive stores sell to a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. We strategically locate our stores close to installers, which are our primary customers, and we deliver products to them routinely throughout each business day by truck. Traditional over-the-counter retail sales make up a smaller part of our overall business and vary by geography.\nIndependently-owned stores purchase inventory from company-operated distribution centers. These independently-owned stores are responsible for operating and managing their businesses, including operating costs and capital expenditures. We generally do not receive a royalty or franchise fee from independently-owned stores. Independently-owned stores, which represent approximately 68% of our total automotive stores, provide a competitive advantage by allowing for local market knowledge and insights, enabling quicker adaptation to local customer preferences.\nThe mix of independently-owned versus company-owned stores in a given market varies based on several factors including our overall market strategy, the ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability and expected ultimate size of the market and our ability to provide operational support within a geographic region. In our Australasian operations, we go to market with a company-owned store model.\nDuring 2023, we expanded our network with the addition of 173 net new stores during the year. The following table details the breakdown of our Automotive distribution network including our distribution centers, company-owned and independently-owned automotive stores by geographic region as of December 31, 2023.\nInstaller Networks\n.\nWe provide programs for repair centers to join regional networks to leverage our branding and supply network to increase their visibility and awareness while remaining independent. The largest of these is our independent NAPA  Auto Care center network in the U.S. and Canada, which includes over 18,000 locations nationwide.\nNAPA\n.\nWe are the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association, LLC a voluntary association formed in 1925 to promote the distribution of automotive parts for its members. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association that develops marketing concepts and programs for its sole member.\nAmong the automotive products purchased by us from various manufacturers for distribution are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA” lines. Generally, we are not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts and we may purchase competitive lines from the same as well as other supply sources.\n4\nWe use the federally registered trademark NAPA\n®\nas part of the trade name of many of our distribution centers and parts stores in the U.S., Canada and Australia. We fund NAPA’s advertising program, which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines.\nWe are a party to, together with the former members of NAPA, a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among us and former NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers.\nCompetition.\nThe automotive aftermarket is highly competitive. We compete with other national, regional and local automotive parts chains, automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers, and warehouse clubs. In addition, we compete with the distributing outlets of parts manufacturers, mass merchandisers (including national retail chains) and other parts distributors and retailers, including online retailers. We compete primarily on availability of product offering, service, brand recognition and price. Our automotive competitors include AutoZone, Inc., O-Reilly Auto Parts, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, Inc., LKQ Corporation and Bapcor, among many others. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.”\nINDUSTRIAL\nOur Industrial segment, which represents approximately 38% of total GPC net sales, operates in both North America and Australasia through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Motion Industries, Inc. (“Motion”), headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, and Motion Asia Pacific, headquartered in Sydney, Australia. Our Industrial business offers replacement parts and solutions to maintenance, repair and operation (“MRO”) customers and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers. Our Industrial segment operates in a large and fragmented market with a total addressable market of greater than $150 billion. In 2023, our Industrial segment served more than 200,000 MRO and OEM customers in all types of industries with more than 900,000 customer locations. Our Industrial segment services all manufacturing and processing industries with access to a database of over 19 million parts.\nThe nature of Motion's business demands the maintenance of adequate inventories and the ability to promptly meet critical delivery requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer or used in plant and facility maintenance activities. Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of order receipt. The majority of all sales are on open account. Motion has ongoing sales agreements with many of its national account customers which, collectively, represent approximately 45% of its annual sales volume.\nOperations & Products\n.\nMotion is a premier industrial solutions company in North America and Australasia (including Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore) due to our superior customer service, value-added services and over 19 million replacement parts. Our product and solution offerings include MRO and OEM support, specialty stores, on-site solutions offerings, service and repair offerings, and e-business assistance. We distribute a large range of MRO and OEM industrial products, such as replacement parts and related supplies such as abrasives, adhesives, sealants and tape, bearings, chemicals, cutting tools, electrical, facility maintenance, hose and fittings, hydraulics, janitorial, mechanical power transmission, pneumatics, process pumps and equipment, safety, seals and gaskets, and tools and testing instruments. The sectors we operate in include aggregate and cement, automotive, chemical and allied products, equipment and machinery, equipment rental and leasing, fabricated metals, food and beverage, iron and steel, lumber and wood, oil and gas, pulp and paper, and rubber products. We have strategically targeted specialty industries in power generation, alternative energy, government, transportation, ports, and an electric vehicle battery category based on increasing opportunities presented by the build-out of new battery manufacturing facilities across North America.\nThe Industrial business provides customers with supply chain efficiencies achieved through our on-site solutions offering. This service provides inventory management, asset repair and tracking, vendor managed inventory (\"VMI\"), as well as radio frequency identification (\"RFID\") asset management of the customer’s inventory. Industrial also provides a wide range of services and repairs such as gearbox and fluid power assembly and repair, process pump assembly and repair, hydraulic drive shaft repair, electrical panel assembly and repair, and hose and gasket manufacture and assembly. Motion is also a leading supplier or automation products and motion control solutions in North America through Motion AI. Separately, Motion provides leading e-business capabilities through MiSupplierConnect, a highly developed supply chain with vendor partnerships and connectivity that provides integration between our information technology network and suppliers’ systems, creating numerous benefits for both\n5\nthe supplier and customer. These services and supply chain efficiencies assist Motion in providing the cost savings that many of its customers require and expect.\nDistribution Network\n.\nThe following table details the breakdown of our Industrial distribution centers, branches and service centers by geographic region as of December 31, 2023.\nOur Industrial distribution centers serve the branches and service centers located throughout the geographic regions in which we operate. The branches and service centers, in turn, sell to MRO and OEM customers in all types of industries across North America and Australasia.\nWe are committed to enhancing the customer experience by improving access to inventory through our fulfillment centers. The fulfillment center strategy is designed to address the customer expectations of a broader inventory selection closer to the point of demand, supported by world-class final-mile delivery occurring the next business day with same-day service available. We continue to invest in our fulfillment center strategy with the opening of a second North American facility in 2023. We plan to open one to three North American facilities in 2024 and continue to invest in additional facilities in the future.\nIn North America, our Industrial business stocks or distributes more than 19 million different items purchased from more than 47,000 different suppliers. Its service centers provide hydraulic, hose and mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately 47% of total industrial product purchases in 2023 were made from our top 50 strategic suppliers. Sales are generated from facilities in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Mexico and Canada.\nIn Australasia, our Industrial business operates a network of distribution centers, branches and service centers across Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore as of December 31, 2023.\nMost branches are facilities that stock inventory representative of the products used by customers in the respective market areas served.\nSupplier Agreements\n.\nNon-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been our experience that the custom of the trade is to treat such agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent.\nCompetition\n.\nThe industrial distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with national, regional and local distributors, general line distributors and others. To a lesser extent, we compete with manufacturers that sell directly to the customer and with various industrial eCommerce sites. Our Industrial competitors include Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., Fastenal Company, and W.W. Grainger, Inc, among many others. We compete primarily on the breadth of product offerings, quality service and competitive pricing. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.”\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\nWe are committed to the development of sustainable and efficient operations and business practices that enhance and protect our people, our communities and our planet. Our goal is to generate above-market returns while aligning our business practices to support the interests of our stakeholders.\nOur process of defining sustainability priorities focuses on the simultaneous improvement of our environmental, social and financial position, and our strong leadership and governance practices that strive to integrate sustainability into our business strategy and corporate culture. The Nominating and ESG Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our sustainability initiatives which aim to deliver long-term value for our shareholders and all our stakeholders.\nWe seek to promote a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace and to ensure the health, safety and well-being of all employees. We emphasize giving back and uplifting the communities in which we operate through partnerships and volunteer efforts. Refer to the “Human Capital Management” section below for further information on our human capital management initiatives.\nWe are committed to reducing our environmental footprint through the implementation of sustainable initiatives throughout our value chain. We are continuously incorporating environmental stewardship in our practices and\n6\ndiscovering opportunities to develop more efficient operations. Additional information regarding our sustainability efforts and future initiatives can be found in our 2023 Sustainability Report and the Sustainability section of our website at www.genpt.com.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nOur key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to connect prospective and current talent to opportunities at the company, engage current employees through an inclusive and diverse culture, and develop employees to grow for future opportunities within the organization.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed more than 60,000 people worldwide and operated within 17 countries. We are proud of our employees and are committed to helping them improve their physical, emotional, financial and social well-being. Our benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce across businesses and geographies while helping our employees care for themselves and their families. We offer healthcare benefits aimed at improving quality of care while limiting out-of-pocket costs. In addition, our well-being programs include an online platform that offers an interactive way to accomplish personal and financial goals and a rewards platform to reward employees for completing company sponsored competitions and well-being activities.\nWe periodically conduct a global engagement survey as a means of measuring employee engagement and satisfaction, as well as a tool for improving our human capital management strategies. Our leadership team reviews the survey results and based on the survey responses, action plans are developed to focus on areas of opportunity. We are pleased to report that our most recent engagement survey results were favorable overall and have shown that our employees are proud to work for the company. The results of the engagement surveys help us continuously improve our human capital strategies and find ways to foster engagement and growth for our employees.\nIn addition, to empower employees to continually enhance their skills and reach their maximum potential, we provide a range of development programs, resources, and opportunities. Many are facilitated locally by each business unit with core leadership development at the Corporate level. One of our more significant programs is focused on high potential employees from all global business units. This program is a combination of in-person and virtual coursework and training with the intent that participants become fully immersed in the operations of our business and develop strategies and improvements cross-functionally. We also offer various internship and rotational programs that allow employees to see different operations of our business while also building strong relationships throughout the company. Other development opportunities include on-demand and live training courses to help our employees achieve their professional and personal goals. We believe these programs demonstrate our ongoing commitment to develop our future leaders.\nWe provide scholarships with an emphasis for students who attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities and collaborate with organizations that support women such as Women in Technology and Women in Auto Care. We also support organizations that advance the interests of disadvantaged individuals and communities in need. We continue to partner with Georgia Minority Supplier Diversity Council, the Georgia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, United Way's African American Partnership and Young Professional Leaders, among other programs.\nOur culture is strengthened by our core values, which includes a steadfast commitment to standing up for equality for our teammates, suppliers, customers, communities and other stakeholders. As part of our investment in our people, we make diversity, equity and inclusion a top priority. We promote a diverse, inclusive, and innovative culture that encourages and embraces change, diverse ideas, and perspectives. We strive to ensure our teammates reflect our global and diverse customer base. We are committed to creating a welcoming environment where all teammates have opportunities to grow and feel a sense of belonging, regardless of gender, sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender expression or experiences. Our goal is to create an inclusive and welcoming culture where we value, respect, and provide equal opportunities for all employees.\nOur efforts are also directed internally where we encourage the exchange of ideas, actively listen to employee dialogue, provide appropriate training, and ensure that the interests of all our employees are supported and advanced. This year we launched three new business resource groups (\"BRGs\"). These BRGs, along with our existing BRGs, provide our teammates with venues for personal and professional development, including networking, coaching, skill building, community engagement, volunteering and advancement opportunities. We aim to leverage key learnings from these groups and expand the program globally. Overall, we seek to create an environment where there is a sense of belonging and all voices are heard and valued.\nPlease refer to our 2023 Sustainability Report and Human Rights Policy, which can be found on our investor relations website, for further information on human capital management.\n7\nAdditional Information\nOur website can be found at www.genpt.com.

    "text": "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nSome statements in this report, as well as in other materials we file with the SEC or otherwise release to the public and in materials that we make available on our website, constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Senior officers may also make verbal statements to analysts, investors, the media and others that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may relate, for example, to future operations, including the anticipated synergies and benefits of any acquisitions or divestitures, as well as prospects, strategies, investments, financial condition, economic performance (including growth and earnings), industry conditions and demand for our products and services. We caution that our forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and while we believe that our expectations for the future are reasonable in view of currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.\nForward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no duty to update our forward-looking statements except as required by law. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent Forms 10-Q, 8-K and other reports filed with the SEC.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that, if they were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report and in the other public statements we make. Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our securities. The considerations and risks that follow are organized within relevant headings but may be relevant to other headings as well. In addition, the material risks and uncertainties described below does not indicate that the risk has not already materialized.\nSTRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows.\nOur business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute. Demand for these products depends on many factors.\nWith respect to our Automotive segment, the primary factors are:\n•\nthe number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair;\n8\n•\nthe number of vehicles in the automotive fleet, a function of new vehicle sales and vehicle scrappage rates, as a steady or growing total vehicle population supports the continued demand for maintenance and repair;\n•\nthe quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles;\n•\nthe number of vehicles in current service that are six years old and older, as these vehicles are typically no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles;\n•\nthe addition of electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, ride sharing services, alternative transportation means and autonomously driven vehicles and future legislation, including incentivizing the purchase of electric and hybrid vehicles, related thereto, may result in reduced need for parts;\n•\ngas prices, as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from using their vehicles;\n•\nchanges in travel patterns, which may cause consumers to rely more on other transportation;\n•\nthe weather, as milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts, while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles; extremely hot or cold conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts, and global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other weather conditions that could impact our business;\n•\nrestrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation, as consumers may be forced to have all diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks; and\n•\nthe economy generally, which in declining conditions may cause consumers to defer vehicle maintenance and repair and defer discretionary spending.\nWith respect to our Industrial segment, the primary factors are:\n•\nthe level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity utilization, as these indices reflect the need for industrial replacement parts;\n•\nchanges in manufacturing reflected in the level of the Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, as an index reading of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while a reading below 50 implies a contracting manufacturing economy;\n•\nthe consolidation of certain of our manufacturing customers and the trend of manufacturing operations being moved overseas, which subsequently reduces demand for our products;\n•\nchanges in legislation or government regulations or policies which could impact international trade among our multi-national customer base and cause reduced demand for our products; and\n•\nthe economy in general, which in declining conditions may cause reduced demand for industrial output.\nWe depend on our relationships with our suppliers, and a disruption of these relationships or of our suppliers’ operations could harm our business.\nAs a distributor of automotive and industrial parts, our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our suppliers. We depend on our suppliers to sell us quality products at favorable prices. A variety of factors, many outside our control, affect our suppliers' ability to deliver quality merchandise to us at favorable prices and in a timely manner. These include raw material shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity, labor strikes, shortages and disputes anywhere within the supply and distribution chain delivering products to us, tariff and customs legislation and enforcement, transportation disruptions, tax and other legislative uncertainties, public health emergencies and/or weather conditions. In recent years, partly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors beyond our control, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Gaza strip, we have experienced and may continue to experience supply chain disruptions, particularly with regard to global labor shortages and inventory sourced from outside the U.S. These disruptions have not had a material impact on our business to date, but we cannot provide any assurance that these or new supply chain disruptions, including from recent unrest in the Middle East, will not materially or adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\n9\nFurthermore, financial or operational difficulties at a particular supplier could cause that supplier to increase the cost, or decrease the quality, of the products we purchase. For example, increased pressure for wage and\nbenefit increases for suppliers in the U.S. based on the September 2023 strike by the United Auto Workers (“UAW”)\nand UAW’s ongoing strategy of targeted strikes could impact our suppliers and increase the costs of the products we purchase. Supplier consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products. In addition, we would suffer an adverse impact if our suppliers limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence.\nWe face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.\nThe sale of automotive and industrial parts is highly competitive and impacted by many factors, including name recognition, product availability, customer service, changing customer preferences, store location, and pricing pressures. Because we seek to offer competitive prices, we may be forced to reduce our prices if our competitors reduce their prices or increase promotional spending, which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings. Increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts, including increased availability among digital and e-commerce providers across the markets in which we do business, could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We anticipate no decline in competition in any of our business segments in the foreseeable future.\nIn particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors. We compete primarily with international, national and regional auto parts chains, independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass merchandisers, internet providers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products, and regional and local full service automotive repair shops, both new and established.\nFurthermore, the automotive aftermarket industry continues to experience consolidation. Consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position, provide them with the ability to offer more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete, take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more\nreadily, more successfully utilize developing technology, including data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine\nlearning, and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers. If we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.\nThe impact of geopolitical conflicts may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including throughout western Europe and Australasia. As a result, our global operations are affected by economic, geopolitical and other conditions in the foreign countries in which we do business as well as U.S. laws regulating international trade. Specifically, instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world (including as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in the Gaza strip, general unrest in the Middle East, and China-Taiwan relations) and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions and supply chains. For example, the U.S., other NATO members and other countries across the globe have instituted sanctions and other penalties against Russia in response to its conflict with Ukraine. While we do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine, retaliatory measures such as this have created, and may continue to create, global security concerns that could result in broader military and political conflicts, further disrupt global automotive supply chains and otherwise have a substantial impact on regional and global economies, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, particularly our European operations.\nWhile the broader consequences are uncertain at this time, the continuation and/or escalation of these or other geopolitical conflicts creates a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, including:\n•\nincreased inflation and significant volatility in commodity prices;\n•\ndisruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattacks, ransom attacks or cyber-intrusion;\n•\nadverse changes in international trade policies and relations;\n•\nour ability to maintain or increase our prices, including freight in response to increased fuel costs;\n•\ndisruptions in global supply chains;\n•\nincreased exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and\n•\nconstraints, volatility or disruption in the credit and capital markets.\n10\nIf we experience a security breach, if our internal information systems fail to function properly or if we are unsuccessful in implementing, integrating or upgrading our information systems, our business operations could be materially affected.\nWe depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost effective operations, provide superior service to customers and accumulate financial results, among many other things.\nDespite our implementation of various security measures, our IT systems and operations could be subject to damage or interruption from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized physical or electronic access, power outages, telecommunications failure, computer system or network failures, wire transfer failure, employee error/malfeasance, cyber-attacks, security breaches, and other similar disruptions. In addition, the IT systems of\nbusinesses that we have acquired or may acquire could present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the\nacquisition or other issues that continue to pose risk to us, such as those related to collection, use maintenance and\ndata disclosure practices or other cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of IT systems change frequently, including as a result of the deployment of\nevolving artificial intelligence tools used to identify vulnerabilities and create more effective phishing attempts, and have the potential to not be recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. Maintaining, operating, and protecting these systems and related personal and sensitive information about our employees, customers and suppliers requires continuous investments in physical and technological security measures, employee training, and third-party services which we have made and will continue to make. A cyber-attack or security breach could result in, among other things, sensitive and confidential data being lost, manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or delay our ability to process customer orders and manage inventory. While we also seek to obtain assurances from third parties with whom we interact to protect confidential information, there are risks that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by such third parties may be compromised.\nTo date, we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity; however, our computer systems and the computer systems of our third-party service providers have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other malicious codes. In particular, the increase in work-from-home arrangements have led businesses to increase reliance on virtual environments and communications systems, which have been subjected to increasing third-party vulnerabilities and security risks.\nA serious prolonged disruption of our information systems for any of the above reasons could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales or otherwise impact earnings and cash flows. Furthermore, such a disruption may harm our reputation and business prospects and subject us to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers, employees or suppliers' information. As the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs. As threats related to cybersecurity breaches grow more sophisticated and frequent, it may become more difficult to timely detect and protect our data and infrastructure.\nWe recognize the growing demand for business-to-business and business-to-customer e-commerce options and solutions, and we could lose business if we fail to provide the e-commerce options and solutions our customers wish to use.\nOur retail and business customers increasingly demand convenient, easy-to-use e-commerce tools as an option to conduct their business with us. The success of our e-commerce platform depends on our ability to accurately identify the products to make available through our e-commerce platform, and to provide and maintain an efficient online experience with the highest level of data security for our customers. Operating an e-commerce platform is a complex undertaking and exposes us to risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internet-based businesses, included risks related to, among other things, our ability to support, expand, and develop our internet operations, website, mobile applications and software and related operational systems. Continuing to improve our e-commerce platform involves substantial investment of capital and resources, increasing supply chain and distribution capabilities, attracting, developing and retaining qualified personnel with relevant subject matter expertise and effectively managing and improving the customer experience. If we are unable to successfully provide the e-commerce solutions our retail and business customers desire, we may lose existing customers and fail to attract new ones. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected as a result.\n11\nOur dependence on key personnel and the increasing potential for union activity could adversely affect our future results and harm our business.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel. We believe our management team’s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan. We also will need to continue to attract, motivate, and retain other key personnel as well as maintain employee safety and well-being. The loss of services of members of our senior management team or other key employees, the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed or failure to plan for the succession of senior management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, there has recently been an increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union, particularly in the U.S. There can be no assurance that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future, which could among other things, adversely impact our culture, increase operating costs and otherwise disrupt our business and operations.\nOur strategic transactions, initiatives and transformation plan involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and initiatives.\nWe regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies and various other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty, and we face significant competition in pursuing strategically beneficially transactions. Pursuing strategic transactions is also a time-consuming process that can involve significant expenses and management attention. For each of our acquisitions, we need to successfully integrate the target company’s products, services, associates and systems into our business operations, including in particular the challenges associated with the integration of foreign operations to ensure the adequacy of internal controls. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings. In addition, any investments we hold in other companies are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of our investment. We also consider and enter into divestitures from time to time, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in cost savings and various other benefits. Strategic divestitures are subject to uncertainty and can be a complex and time-consuming process. If the divestiture is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, or if we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of the divestiture in a manner consistent with our strategic objectives, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the divestiture.\nAdditionally, as we undertake the transformation plan for our business, we have integrated our strategic initiatives into a cohesive business model which balances competing priorities. If we are unable to implement these strategic initiatives efficiently and effectively, or if these strategic initiatives are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. To facilitate this transformation plan, we are making substantial investments, recruiting new talent, and optimizing our business model, management system, and organization. Accordingly, a strong balance sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in these new growth opportunities and maintaining discipline in our capital allocation is critical to the success of our transformation plans. If we are unable to maintain a strong balance sheet or optimize our capital allocation or are otherwise not successful in executing our strategic initiatives and transformation plan (or are delayed for reasons outside of our control), we may not be able to realize the full benefits of our plan. Furthermore, if we are unable to successfully drive employee or customer adoption of certain strategic initiatives, we may not realize the full benefits of our plan. Additionally, failure to make progress on our plans (or failure to accurately measure progress on our plan), may disrupt the conduct of our business and divert management’s attention and resources. All of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence and negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. However, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. There can be no assurance\n12\nthat all control issues or fraud will be detected. As we continue to grow our business, our internal controls continue to become more complex and require more resources. Further, some of our employees work remotely and could introduce potential vulnerabilities to our financial reporting systems and our internal control environment and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting financial results and may harm our operating results. In addition, if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of each fiscal year end, we may be exposed to negative publicity, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls and any such resulting negative publicity may negatively affect our business and stock price.\nAdditionally, the existence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock.\nMACROECONOMIC, INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL RISKS\nUncertainty and/or deterioration in general macro-economic conditions domestically and globally, including inflation or deflation, employment rates and wages, changes in tax policies, changes in energy costs, uncertain credit markets, or other economic conditions, could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have been and may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions, including inflation or deflation, domestic outputs, geopolitical uncertainty and unrest, employment rates and wages, including increases in minimum wage, changes in tax policies, changes in energy costs, instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, elevated interest rates for prolonged periods, monetary policies, volatile exchange rates, changes in fiscal and regulatory priorities resulting from the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and other challenges that could affect the global economy. Both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources, which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products.\nOur vendors may also be adversely affected by these and other uncertain or deteriorating macro-economic conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our operating results.\nBecause the functional currency of most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency, but our financial reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we are required to translate the assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, we face foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to third-party customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank lines of credit with creditors denominated in foreign currencies.\nForeign currency exchange rates have affected our net sales, net earnings, and operating results and could continue to result in declines in our reported net sales and net earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the comparative prices between products we sell and products our foreign competitors sell in the same market, which may decrease demand for our products. Substantial exchange rate fluctuations as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar or otherwise, may have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows, as well as the comparability of our Consolidated Financial Statements between reporting periods. While we actively manage our foreign currency market risk in the normal course of business by entering into various derivative instruments to hedge against such risk, these derivative instruments involve risks and may not effectively limit our underlying exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or minimize our net earnings and cash volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes. Further, the failure of one or more counterparties to our foreign currency exchange rate contracts to fulfill their obligations to us could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\n13\nWe have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health. For example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things:\n•\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to our unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured senior notes;\n•\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n•\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures or other cash requirements;\n•\nlimit our ability to incur additional debt with acceptable terms; and\n•\nexpose us to fluctuations in interest rates.\nThe terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees. A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also guarantee the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores and certain other affiliates in which we have a non-controlling equity ownership interest. To date, we have not experienced any significant losses in connection with these guarantees. However, if any of the borrowers under these guarantees experienced a default, we may be required to satisfy their payment obligations in an amount that could be material.\nIn addition, our indebtedness is rated by credit rating agencies. Our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors that may or may not be within our control. The interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility, as well as any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future, are impacted by our credit ratings. Accordingly, any negative impact of our credit ratings, or placement of our credit ratings on “review” or “watch” status, could result in higher interest expense and could impact the terms of any additional indebtedness we incur in the future.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nWe may be affected by global climate change or legal, tax, regulatory, or market responses to such change.\nThe concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”). For example, regulations that impose mandatory requirements related to GHG continue to be considered by or have been issued by policy makers in both the federal and certain state governments in the U.S., by the European Union, and by national governments in Canada, the U.K., Australia and elsewhere. Many of the regulations that have been issued create mandatory, annual reporting requirements related to carbon emissions and other sustainability-related information that will ultimately be subject to audit and could expose our company to fines, regulatory inquiry or negative publicity if we fail to comply. Additionally, significant increases in fuel economy requirements, new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or new federal or state incentive programs that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for the products we sell. We may not be able to accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations with respect to electric vehicles and other technologies that minimize emissions. Laws enacted to reduce GHG could directly or indirectly affect our suppliers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in automotive technology (including the adoption of electric vehicles) and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nBecause we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other costs as well as reputational harm.\nWe are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees or other third parties for various reasons, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, we are party to, among other litigation, numerous pending product liability lawsuits relating to our national distribution of automotive parts\n14\nand supplies, many of which involve claims of personal injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts distributed by us. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In particular, on July 8, 2021, the Washington Supreme Court overturned the order of the Washington Court of Appeals and reinstated the trial court's damage award of $77 million against us.\nAdditionally, we are subject to an increasing number of laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate as well as governmental regulations relating to taxes, environmental protection, product quality standards, cybersecurity, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data privacy, building and zoning requirements, and employment law matters. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs. In addition, our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.\nChanges in legislation or government regulations or policies, particularly those relating to taxation and international trade, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nOur business is global, so changes to existing international trade agreements, blocking of foreign trade, increased protectionism, or imposition of tariffs on foreign goods could result in decreased revenues and/or increases in pricing, either of which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods. For instance, the United States imposed Section 232 tariffs on many imported products of steel and aluminum in March 2018 and expanded the tariffs to additional derivative products of steel and aluminum effective February 8, 2020. The United States imposed Section 301 tariffs on most imported products from China starting in July 2018. Although the United States and China reached a Phase One trade deal in January 2020, there was no Phase Two trade deal implemented and most of the tariffs imposed remain in place, while uncertainty persists in the trade relationship between the two countries that impacts the global trade landscape.\nIn addition, as a global business, we are subject to taxation in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the tax laws of these jurisdictions, or in the interpretation or enforcement of existing tax laws, could subject our business to audits, inquiries and legal challenges from taxing authorities and could reduce the benefit of tax structures previously implemented for our operations. As a result, we may incur additional costs, including taxes and penalties for historical periods, that may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGENERAL RISKS\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.\nMany factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers, business partners, investors, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to corporate social responsibility and disclosures and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as environmental stewardship and sustainability, supply chain management, climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion, workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur stock price is subject to fluctuations, and the value of your investment may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations, and may be subject to fluctuations in the future based upon external economic and market conditions. The stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. These broad market, geopolitical and industry factors among others may harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance and growth outlook, and the value of your investment may decline."

The CISO, along with the Chief Information and Digital Officer (\"CIDO\"), each have over 15 years of prior work experience in various roles involving information technology, including security, compliance, and systems. The CISO provides periodic reports, which take into account information from internal stakeholders, known privacy and information security vulnerabilities, threat detection plans, and information from external sources such as reported security incidents, industry trends, and third party evaluations to our CIDO, who provides regular updates to our Audit Committee, Chief Executive Officer, and other members of our executive team. The Audit Committee receives regular updates specific to the Company’s cyber security program and IT security risk, including descriptions of mitigation and incident response plans, projects to continually enhance our information security systems, overviews of awareness and training programs and the emerging threat landscape. The Board of Directors (\"Board\") has ultimate oversight for risks relating to our information security program and practices and receives periodic updates from the Audit Committee Chair on cybersecurity and IT security risk and mitigation strategies, as well as periodic updates directly from the CIDO and CISO. Our program is regularly evaluated by internal and external resources with the results of those reviews reported to senior management, the Audit Committee and the Board. We also actively engage with key vendors, industry participants, and intelligence and law enforcement communities for benchmarking and awareness of best practices as part of our continuing efforts to evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of our information security policies and procedures. As part of our cybersecurity risk management system, our governance, risk & compliance team tracks and logs privacy and security incidents across GPC as well as performs third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors and suppliers. The results of our evaluations and the feedback from our engagements are used to drive alignment on, and prioritization of, initiatives to enhance our cybersecurity strategies, policies, and processes and make recommendations to improve processes.\nOur policies, standards, processes and practices for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats are integrated into our overall risk management program and are based on frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (“NIST CSF”) and other applicable industry standards. In connection with our information security program, we perform ongoing internal and external risk assessment activities, and deploy systems, processes, and procedures across our global business units in response to identified risks. As cybersecurity events are detected via our global processes, the potential impact of the events are assessed using a variety of methods, and our incident response plan is enacted as needed. The incident response plan is periodically evaluated by our cybersecurity team as well as by independent advisors using simulated security events. Security awareness training is also key component of our information security program and involves required training for all our teammates.\nAlthough we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity to date, our computer systems and\nthe computer systems of our third-party service providers have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to\nunauthorized access or phishing attempts, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other malicious codes. For\nmore information about these and other information security risks we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Strategic\nand Operational Risks.”"

While we have historically paid dividends to holders of our common stock on a quarterly basis and expect to continue doing so going forward, the declaration and payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our earnings, financial condition, business development needs and regulatory considerations, and are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nStock Performance Graph\nSet forth below is a line graph comparing the yearly dollar change in the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock against the cumulative total shareholder return of the Standard and Poor’s (\"S&P\") 500 Stock Index and a peer group composite index (“Peer Index”) structured by us as set forth below for the five year period that commenced December 31, 2018 and ended December 31, 2023. This graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2018 in Genuine Parts Company common stock, the S&P 500 Stock Index (we are a member of the S&P 500 Stock Index, and our cumulative total shareholder return went into calculating the S&P 500 Stock Index results set forth in the graph) and the peer group composite index as set forth below, and assumes reinvestment of all dividends.\nComparison of five year cumulative total shareholder return\nGenuine Parts Company, S&P 500 Stock Index and peer group composite index\n18\nIn constructing the Peer Index for use in the stock performance graph above, we used the shareholder returns of various publicly held companies (weighted in accordance with each company’s stock market capitalization at December 31, 2018 and including reinvestment of dividends) that compete with us in our two industry segments: automotive parts and industrial parts (each group of companies included in the Peer Index as competing with us in a separate industry segment is hereinafter referred to as a “Peer Group”). Included in the automotive parts Peer Group are those companies making up the Dow Jones U.S. Auto Parts Index (we are a member of such industry group, and its individual shareholder return was included when calculating the Peer Index results set forth in the performance graph). Included in the industrial parts Peer Group are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., Fastenal Company, and W.W. Grainger, Inc. In determining the Peer Index, each Peer Group was weighted to reflect our annual net sales in each industry segment.\nHolders\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 6,690 holders of record of the company’s common stock. The number of holders of record does not include beneficial owners of the common stock whose shares are held in the names of various dealers, clearing agencies, banks, brokers and other fiduciaries.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table provides information about the purchases of shares of the company’s common stock during the three month period ended December 31, 2023:\n(1)\nIncludes shares surrendered by employees to the company to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of shares of restricted stock, the exercise of share appreciation rights and/or tax withholding obligations.\n(2)\nOn August 21, 2017, the Board of Directors announced that it had authorized the repurchase of 15 million shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The authorization for these repurchase plans continues until all such shares have been repurchased or the repurchase program is terminated by action of the Board of Directors. The program may be suspended at any time and does not have an expiration date. Approximately 8.5 million shares authorized remain available to be repurchased by the company. There were no other repurchase plans announced as of December 31, 2023."

Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nGenuine Parts Company is a global service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive and industrial replacement parts. We have a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia.\nIn 2023, we conducted business in North America, Europe and Australasia from more than 10,700 locations. Our Automotive business operated in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, France, the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand in 2023 and accounted for approximately 62% of total revenues for the year. Our Industrial business operated in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore and accounted for approximately 38% of total revenues.\nOur mission is to be an employer of choice, supplier of choice, valued customer, good corporate citizen and investment of choice for all our shareholders. Additionally, we strive to be a respected community member that gives back to the communities in which we operate. Our strategic financial objectives are intended to align with our mission and drive value for all our stakeholders. Our strategic financial objectives include: (1) revenue growth in excess of market growth; (2) continuously improving operating margins; (3) maintaining a strong balance sheet and cash flows; and (4) effective capital allocation.\nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nWe consider a variety of performance and financial measures in assessing our business, and the key performance indicators used to measure our results are summarized below.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales refer to period-over-period comparisons of our net sales excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency and other. Our calculation of comparable sales is computed using total business days for the period and is inclusive of both company-owned stores and sales to our independent owner's stores. We consider this metric useful to investors because it provides greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our core ongoing operations. This metric is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry, although our calculation of the metric may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because not all companies and analysts calculate this metric in the same manner.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is referred to as gross margin. Cost of goods sold primarily represents the cost of merchandise sold, including the cost of inbound freight from suppliers. It also includes the effects of supplier volume incentives and inventory adjustments. Our gross profit is variable in nature and generally follows changes in net sales. We believe that gross profit and gross margin are useful measures because they allow management, analysts, investors and others to evaluate the profit we generate from our sales, before operating and other expenses and income.\nSelling, Administrative and Other Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nSG&A includes all personnel and personnel-related costs at our corporate offices, segment headquarters, distribution centers, stores and branches, which accounts for more than 60% of total SG&A. Additional costs in SG&A include our facilities, freight and delivery, marketing, advertising, technology, digital, legal and professional costs. Freight and delivery costs are the shipping and handling costs incurred related to delivering merchandise to our customers. We believe SG&A is a useful measure because it allows management, analysts, investors and others to understand the level of costs we incur operating our business each period.\nSegment Profit and Segment Margin\nSegment profit is calculated as net sales less costs of goods sold, operating expenses, and certain non-operating expenses attributable to the segment (e.g., foreign currency), excluding general corporate expenses, net interest expense, intangible asset amortization, and other unallocated amounts that are primarily driven by corporate initiatives. Operating expenses include SG&A at our segments. Segment profit as a percentage of segment net sales is referred to as segment margin.\n20\nWe believe that segment profit and segment margin are useful measures because they allow management, analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of our segments, after the effects of operating and other expenses and income associated with those businesses. Refer to the Segment Data Footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNet Income and EBITDA\nWe believe that net income and EBITDA, along with their adjusted measures, are useful measures of operating performance. EBITDA helps us assess the underlying profitability of our company’s business operations before the effects of certain net expenses that directly arise from our capital investment decisions (depreciation, amortization), financing decisions (interest), and tax strategies (income taxes). Net Income represents our profitability after the effects of all operating and other expenses and income.\nThe adjusted measures of EBITDA and net income eliminate certain non-recurring charges and other items that we do not believe are reflective of our ongoing business performance. These adjusted measures help us evaluate our operating performance on a comparable basis from period-to-period so that we can better understand the ongoing factors and trends affecting our business operations. We also use adjusted EBITDA, together with net income and segment profit, to forecast our performance, evaluate our actual results against our forecasts and compare our results to others in the industries that we serve. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure of performance included in our executive incentive compensation plans. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a discussion of how we define adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur discussion of our results focuses on 2023 and 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between those periods. Discussions of 2021 results and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 results are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nOur sales increased 4.5% in 2023, highlighted by the strength of our Industrial and international automotive businesses, which continued to grow as a result of increased market share and the benefits of recent acquisitions. Our sales growth in 2023 was partially offset by a slight decline in sales at our U.S. Automotive business, which was negatively impacted by moderating inflation levels, which adversely impacted the pricing environment year-over-year, and higher interest rates, which reduced sales to our independent owners.\nOur earnings grew 11.3% in 2023, driven by sales growth in our Industrial and international automotive businesses combined with a 90 basis point improvement in gross margin, which resulted from our investments in pricing initiatives and strategic sourcing programs.\n21\nOur results of operations are summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNet Sales\nOur net sales increase of 4.5% includes a 3.1% comparable sales increase and a 2.0% positive impact from acquisitions, slightly offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency and other of 0.6%.\nAutomotive\nNet sales for Automotive were $14.2 billion in 2023, a 4.2% increase from 2022. The increase includes a 2.8% contribution from acquisitions and 2.1% growth in comparable sales, partially offset by a 0.7%\nunfavorable impact from foreign currency and other.\nThe increase in comparable sales is driven by higher sales in our international businesses, partially offset by a decline in comparable sales in our U.S. Automotive business. Our international businesses benefited from successfully executing strategic initiatives to grow market share and a favorable pricing environment driven by inflation levels, particularly in Europe. These initiatives include investing in technology and enhancing our supply chains to better serve core customers, continuing to expand the rollout of private-label, NAPA branded products in Europe and focusing on the development of key customer accounts. The decline in sales in our U.S. Automotive business was due to a combination of factors, including higher interest rates, which reduced sales to our independent owners. In addition, inflation levels, which produced a benefit to the price we charge to our customers in 2022, moderated throughout 2023, reducing sales year-over-year. Further, lingering supply chain constraints negatively impacted inventory availability in certain product categories resulting in lower sales.\n22\nThe net sales benefit Automotive received from acquisitions includes the impact of our entry into new markets in Spain and Portugal in 2022 and continued expansion in those markets in 2023. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency primarily results from the weakening of the Australian and Canadian dollars compared to the U.S. dollar throughout 2023. The strengthening of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar largely offset this unfavorable impact.\nIndustrial\nNet sales for Industrial were $8.8 billion in 2023, a 4.9% increase from 2022. The increase includes 4.8% growth in comparable sales and a 0.6% contribution from acquisitions. This was slightly offset by a 0.5% unfavorable impact of currency translation.\nOur growth in comparable sales reflects the positive impact of our ongoing sales and pricing initiatives and continued growth in many of the industry segments we serve. Our initiatives include investments to drive improved pricing, technology and supply chain capabilities that are helping to win market share. We attribute our success to our highly diversified product and service offerings, the size and scale or our global network, and strategic acquisitions, including the ongoing benefits from the 2022 acquisition of KDG.\nGross Profit & Gross Margin\nGross profit increased $551 million, or approximately 7.1%, from 2022 and gross margin increased to 35.9% from 35.0% in 2022. The increase in gross profit in 2023 was primarily driven by the increases in net sales. The 90 basis point improvement in gross margin was driven by our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives. These initiatives include enhancing technology to generate better pricing data and analytics, which allows us to respond in real time to shifting pricing dynamics across each market we serve as well as strategies related to sourcing product more efficiently.\nOperating Expenses\nSG&A expenses represent 26.7% of net sales in 2023 compared to 26.1% of net sales in 2022. The increase is primarily driven by planned increases in personnel costs due to wage inflation and global investments in information technology to support our ongoing strategic initiatives. Our investments in technology include improving the digital experience for our employees and customers, enhancing our pricing technology, increasing the automation used in our distribution centers, and modernizing our payment platforms, among others. We also are investing in our supply chain to ensure we have the right assortment for our customers, positioned closer to their places of business so that we can distribute product at a lower cost. Finally, we incurred increased rent and facilities costs in 2023, primarily from inflation on lease renewals and costs for new automotive stores and outlets opened in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn February 2024, we approved and announced a global restructuring designed to better align our assets and further improve the efficiency of the business. This initiative includes an announced voluntary retirement offer in the U.S., along with a rationalization and optimization of certain distribution centers, stores and other facilities. We expect to incur costs of between $100 million and $200 million related to the restructuring efforts in 2024. As a result of the global restructuring, we expect to realize approximately $20 to $40 million of savings in 2024, and approximately $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis. We expect to substantially complete the initiative by the end of 2025. The estimated charges that we expect to incur are subject to a number of assumptions, and actual amounts may differ materially from such estimates. We may also incur additional charges not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of these initiatives.\nNon-Operating Expenses and Income\nWe incurred $5 million in net non-operating expenses in 2023, a $37 million change from $42 million in net non-operating expenses in 2022. This category primarily includes net interest expense, pension and investment income, foreign currency gains and losses, and fees associated with our Accounts Receivable Sales Agreement (\"A/R Sales Agreement\"). The $37 million change includes the effects of a $27 million increase in other non-operating income driven by increased pension income, foreign currency gains, and income from cash surrender value of life insurance policies. It also includes the effects of a $9 million decrease in net interest expense in 2023, which reflects the effects of funding more capital expenditures and adjusting our capital structure to reduce our dependency on higher-cost, short-term financing.\n23\nSegment Profit\nAutomotive\nAutomotive segment profit for 2023 was $1.2 billion, a decrease of 1.4% from 2022. Segment margin decreased 50 basis points to 8.2% in 2023 compared to 8.7% in 2022. Automotive segment margin was negatively impacted by lower sales in the U.S., as described herein, combined with planned investments in wages and information technology.\nIndustrial\nIndustrial segment profit increased 24.4% to $1.1 billion and its segment margin improved 200 basis points to 12.5% compared to 10.5% in 2022. The improved Industrial segment margin is primarily due to continued sales growth and our focus on leveraging expenses and executing supply chain initiatives as well as other strategic initiatives in areas such as category management and pricing. Our segment margin also benefited from the accelerated integration of KDG, allowing us to realize more synergies earlier than planned.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 24.4% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 24.8% in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the rate decrease is primarily due to domestic tax credit benefits and statute-related adjustments.\nEffective for years starting on or after December 31, 2023, certain countries have enacted legislation establishing a global 15% per-country minimum tax, which we do not expect to have a material impact to our financial statements.\nNet Income\nNet income was $1.3 billion in 2023 compared to $1.2 billion in 2022. Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") was $9.33 in 2023, up 12.3% compared to $8.31 in 2022. Adjusted net income was $1.3 billion in 2023, an increase of 10.9% from $1.2 billion in 2022. Adjusted diluted EPS was $9.33, a 11.9% increase compared to $8.34 in 2022. EBITDA was $2.2 billion in 2023, an increase of 8.2% from $2.0 billion in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 billion in 2023, an increase of 7.9% from $2.0 billion in 2022.\nThe growth in these metrics in all periods presented reflects improved segment margin, primarily in our Industrial segment, driven by higher revenue, particularly in our international business. We also benefited from the continued execution of our strategic pricing and other initiatives, as discussed more fully in the commentary above.\nAdjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures (see table below for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures).\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following tables set forth reconciliations of net income and diluted EPS to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, respectively, to account for the impact of adjustments. We also include reconciliations from net income to adjusted EBITDA, net income to total segment profit and total segment margin and segment profit to segment EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for each segment. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, total segment profit and adjusted EBITDA, which are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations. We consider these metrics useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We believe these measures to be useful to enhance the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors, as well as to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with our core operations. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.\n24\nThe table below represents a reconciliation from GAAP net income to adjusted net income:\nThe table below represents amounts per common share assuming dilution:\n(1)\nAdjustment reflects a gain on the sale of real estate that had been leased to S.P. Richards.\n(2)\nAdjustment reflects insurance recoveries in excess of losses incurred on inventory, property, plant and equipment and other fire-related costs.\n(3)\nAdjustment to remeasure product liability for a revised estimate of the number of claims to be incurred in future periods, among other assumptions.\n(4)\nAdjustment primarily includes costs of $67 million associated with the January 3, 2022 acquisition and integration of KDG which includes a $17 million impairment charge. The impairment charge was driven by a decision to retire certain legacy trade names, classified as other intangible assets, prior to the end of their estimated useful lives as part of executing our KDG integration and rebranding strategy. Separately, this adjustment includes an $11 million loss related to an investment.\n(5)\nWe determine the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments by considering the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdictions of the underlying non-GAAP adjustments, including any related valuation allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we applied the statutory income tax rates to the taxable portion of all of our adjustments, which resulted in a tax impact of $137 thousand. A portion of our transaction\n25\ncosts included in our non-GAAP adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2022 were not deductible for income tax purposes; therefore, no statutory income tax rate was applied to such costs.\nThe table below represents a reconciliation from GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA:\n(1)\nAmounts are the same as adjustments included within the adjusted net income table above.\nThe table below clarifies where the adjusted items are presented in the consolidated statement of income:\nThe table below represents a reconciliation from GAAP net income to total segment profit:\n(1)\nAmounts are the same as adjustments included within the adjusted net income table above.\n(2)\nRepresents GAAP net income as a percentage of GAAP net sales.\n(3)\nRepresents total segment profit as a percentage of GAAP net sales.\n26\nThe table below represents a reconciliation from segment profit to segment EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:\n(1)    These represent costs for certain functions, including cybersecurity and product liability litigation that were transferred to Corporate beginning in 2023 to be streamlined and centrally managed. We presented the 2022 comparative period to reflect how management manages these costs in 2023 and going forward.\n(2)    Amounts are the same as adjustments included within the adjusted net income table above.\nOUTLOOK\nWe expect continued revenue and earnings growth in 2024, despite uncertain economic conditions. Positive trends related to miles driven, aging vehicles and continued limited new car inventory remain supportive of the sustained demand for our global Automotive business. In addition, we believe our Industrial business benefits from the diversity of our product and service offerings. We expect our growing capabilities in industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and conveyance to be differentiators for our business.\nWe expect macroeconomic headwinds to result in continued pressure in 2024. In particular, our customers are facing economic challenges from persistent cost and wage inflation, heightened interest rates and general economic uncertainty. Our 2024 Automotive net sales growth includes the negative impact of new supplier incentives that will benefit our customers. We negotiated these as part of changing certain supplier relationships. The new supplier incentives we receive will be recognized as part of our inventory cost, reducing cost of sales, and the incentives we pass to our customers will be recognized as a reduction of net sales. On a like-for-like basis, we do not anticipate any significant negative impact to gross profit from these new arrangements. We expect this structure, among other factors, to continue to impact our overall sales growth throughout 2024.\nWe are committed to improving operating leverage and continued earnings growth through disciplined cost actions and initiatives. We continue to execute our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives and expect to drive improvement in gross margins. We expect to continue to make global investments in information technology and supply chain to support our ongoing strategic initiatives and improve our product availability across all categories, which will impact our costs. We will continue to manage inventory strategically to maximize our ability to quickly adjust with customer demand, which will impact our cash from operations. We remain committed to driving sales\n27\nand earnings growth throughout 2024, while continuing to return cash to our shareholders. Our outlook for 2024 reflects the ongoing confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute through the dynamic economic environment.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nOur cash balance at December 31, 2023 was $1.1 billion compared to cash of $653 million a year ago. Accounts receivable increased $35 million, or 1.6%, from December 31, 2022 primarily due to higher net sales. Inventory increased $235 million, or 5.3% from December 31, 2022 in association with new store openings in Automotive and improving inventory levels based on customer demand. Accounts payable increased $43 million, or 0.8% from December 31, 2022 due to increased purchases to support higher net sales. Total debt of $3.9 billion at December 31, 2023 increased $577 million from December 31, 2022 primarily due to the November 1, 2023 Senior Notes offering (as discussed below).\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur strong financial position and cash flow performance have provided us with the capacity to invest in acquisitions, capital expenditures and technology to support our global growth strategy, as well as return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by issuing commercial paper, private and public issuances of debt and bank borrowings.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nA summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows:\nOperating Activities\nThe cash provided by operating activities decreased $31 million compared to 2022. The decrease is driven by changes in working capital, primarily the result of extended payment terms received in 2021 and 2022 that did not repeat in the current year. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income.\nInvesting Activities\nWe continue to invest in our business through strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to broaden our product and service offerings, improve our business operations and expand our global footprint. In 2023, net cash used in investing activities included $513 million in capital expenditures to improve our supply chain, facilities, and technology environment and $309 million used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities. Additionally, we received $80 million related to cash proceeds from the sale of our remaining investment in S.P. Richards and other investments and $25 million proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities reflects dividends paid to shareholders of $527 million and repurchases of our common stock of $261 million. This was partially offset by $531 million of cash after application of the net proceeds from debt primarily from the 2023 Senior Notes offering (described below). In 2023, we announced a 6% increase in our regular quarterly cash dividend, we have paid a cash dividend every year since going public in 1948, and 2023 marks the 67th consecutive year of increased dividends paid to shareholders.\nCurrently, we believe that our cash on hand and available short-term and long-term sources of capital are sufficient to fund our operations in both the short and long term, including working capital requirements, strategic acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures, scheduled debt and interest payments, and income tax obligations.\nNotes and Other Borrowings\nOn November 1, 2023, we issued $425 million of unsecured 6.50% Senior Notes due 2028. Simultaneously, we issued $375 million of unsecured 6.88% Senior Notes due 2033. For both offerings, interest is payable semi-annually on November 1 and May 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2024.\n28\nOn November 29, 2023, we entered into a commercial paper program that allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to $1.5 billion. As of December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $3.9 billion of unsecured Senior Notes outstanding. Approximately $1.6 billion of these borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants under our Syndicated Facility Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2020, as amended (the \"Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\") and our outstanding unsecured Senior Notes. Any failure to comply with our debt covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our financing arrangements or require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could create cross defaults under other debt arrangements and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe ended the year with $2.6 billion of total liquidity (comprising $1.5 billion availability on the revolving credit facility and $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents). Due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, we also had unused letters of credit of approximately $71 million outstanding at December 31, 2023. Our unused letters of credit expire within one year, but have automatic renewal clauses. From time to time, we may enter into other credit facilities or financing arrangements to provide additional liquidity and to manage against foreign currency risk.\nOur total average cost of debt was 3.16% at December 31, 2023 and 2.33% at December 31, 2022. Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $64 million and $74 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Refer to the Debt Footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nContractual and Other Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our material cash requirements at December 31, 2023 that we expect to be paid in cash. The table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, including legal contingencies and uncertain tax positions. The amounts presented are based on various estimates and actual results may vary from the amounts presented.\nPurchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual cash requirement, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.\nAdditionally, we guarantee the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which we have a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to our guarantee. At December 31, 2023, the total borrowings of the independents and affiliates subject to guarantee by the company were approximately $954 million. These loans generally mature over periods from one to six years. Our amount of commitment expiring in 2024 is approximately $342 million. To date, we have had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings.\nShare Repurchases\nIn 2023, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate $261 million, and we had remaining authority to purchase approximately 8.5 million shares of our common stock at December 31, 2023. We expect to remain active in our share repurchase program and continue to return capital to our shareholders. There were no other repurchase plans announced as of December 31, 2023.\n29\nCapital Resources\nOur total debt outstanding at December 31, 2023 increased by $577 million from December 31, 2022, as discussed above.\nWe expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both short-term and long-term bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new long-term debt. The availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected, however, by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios. The table below reflects our debt ratings by Standard & Poor’s (\"S&P\") and Moody’s as of December 31, 2023, which provide an enhanced understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of debt. A debt rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or\nhold and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For further information on the critical accounting policies, see the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsideration Received from Vendors\nWe frequently enter into agreements with our vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives. Generally, we earn inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other similar criteria. We accrue for the receipt of these incentives as a deduction from our inventory carrying cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year. We recognize these incentives in earnings as a reduction of costs of goods sold as the corresponding inventory is sold to our customers. While management believes we will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2024 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives. Consideration receivable from vendors, generally reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets, was $928 million and $847 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAt least annually, we evaluate property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating for impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows which requires judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Refer to the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing.\n30\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nOur benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of our pension plan assets. Our U.S. plan, our largest pension plan, is well-funded, with a fund status of 131% at December 31, 2023. The plans in Europe are unfunded and therefore there are no plan assets. Our pension plan investment strategy implemented by our management is to achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada, as well as fiduciary standards. The long-term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long-term rates of return. Our investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (38% U.S. Large-cap stocks, 4% U.S. Mid-cap stocks, 5% U.S. Small-cap stocks, 10% International stocks, 3% Emerging Market stocks and 40% Barclays U.S. Gov/Credit Index).\nWe make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension income. We believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and turnover rates. Refer to the Employee Benefit Plans Footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these assumptions.\nBased on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as an asset study that was performed based on our asset allocations and future expectations, our expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2024 pension income is 7.61% for the plans. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of our benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships.\nThe discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high-quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 5.30% at December 31, 2023.\nOur pension income for 2023 is determined at the December 31, 2022 measurement date. A 25 basis point increase in discount rate would result in an approximate $44 million decrease on our projected benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would result in approximate $46 million increase on our projected benefit obligation. A 25 basis point change in discount rate would have an immaterial impact on our pension income. A 25 basis point change in expected return on asset would have an approximate $6 million impact on our pension income. These sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time and assume no changes to the design of the pension plans.\nEffective December 31, 2013, our defined benefit pension plans were amended to freeze benefit plan accruals for participants and provide for immediate vesting of accrued benefits. Net periodic benefit income for our defined benefit pension plans was $44 million, $27 million, and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The income associated with the pension plans in 2023, 2022 and 2021 reflects the impact of the freeze. Refer to the Employee Benefit Plans Footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire businesses, we apply the acquisition method of accounting and recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date, which requires significant estimates and assumptions. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method requires us to record provisional amounts for any items for which the accounting is not complete at the end of a reporting period. We must complete the accounting during the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year. Adjustments made during the measurement period could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe typically measure customer relationships and other intangible assets using an income approach. Significant estimates and assumptions used in this approach include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset (e.g., future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins). If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired tangible and intangible\n31\nassets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased, or the acquired asset could be impaired.\nLegal and Product Liabilities\nWe accrue for potential losses related to legal disputes, litigation, product liabilities, and regulatory matters when it is probable (the future event or events are likely to occur) that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nTo calculate product liabilities, we estimate potential losses relating to pending claims and also estimate the likelihood of additional, similar claims being filed against us in the future. To estimate potential losses on claims that could be filed in the future, we consider claims pending against us, claim filing rates, the number of codefendants and the extent to which they share in settlements, and the amount of loss by claim type. The estimated losses for pending and potential future claims are calculated on a discounted basis using risk-free interest rates derived from market data about monetary assets with maturities comparable to those of the projected product liabilities. We use an actuarial specialist to assist with measuring our product liabilities. While we believe our legal and product liability estimates are reasonable in light of all available information, if one or more legal claims were to greatly exceed our estimates, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Refer to the Commitments and Contingencies Footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding product liabilities.\nSelf Insurance\nWe are self-insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs. A reserve for claims incurred but not reported is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by our claims administrators. These reserves are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year.\nLong-term insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for our workers’ compensation program. In addition, we carry various large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for the majority of workers’ compensation liabilities. We record the workers’ compensation reserves based on an analysis performed by an independent actuary. The analysis calculates development factors, which are applied to total reserves as provided by the various insurance companies who underwrite the program. While we believe that the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect workers’ compensation costs.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements."

    "text": "Although we do not face material risks related to commodity prices, we are exposed to changes in interest rates and in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses.\nForeign Currency\nWe incur translation gains or losses resulting from the translation of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes. For the periods presented, our principal foreign currency exchange exposures are the Euro, the primary functional currency of our European operations; the Canadian dollar, the functional currency of our Canadian operations; and the Australian dollar, the primary functional currency of our Australasian operations. We monitor our foreign currency exposures and from time to time, we enter into currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange exposure, in regard to the Australian and Canadian dollar, negatively impacted our results, while the Euro positively impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Foreign currency exchange exposure, particularly in regard to the Australian and Canadian dollar, and to a lesser extent the Euro, positively impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring 2023 and 2022, it was estimated that a 10% shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $797 million and $723 million, respectively. A 15% shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $1.2 billion in 2023 and $1.1 billion in 2022. A 20% shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $1.6 billion in 2023 and $1.4 billion in 2022.\n32\nInterest Rates\nWe are subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt and with respect to the A/R Sales Agreement, for which the fees are linked to interest rate changes. We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. As of December 31, 2023, we primarily had fixed-rate debt. Based on our variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have an immaterial impact in 2023 and 2022 and would increase the fees on our A/R Sales Agreement by $10 million.\nInflation\nIn fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we experienced inflationary pressures across various parts of our business and operations, including, but not limited to, increases to our product costs, overhead costs and rising costs across our supply chain. We continue to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. If our costs were to be subject to more significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases or other cost efficiency measures. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n33"

    "text": "ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n34\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n35\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the company’s auditor since 1948.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 22, 2024\n36\nGenuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In Thousands, Except Share Data and per Share Amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\n37\nGenuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(In Thousands, Except per Share Amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\n38\nGenuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n(In Thousands, Except per Share Amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\n39\nGenuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\n(In Thousands, Except Share Data and per Share Amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\n40\nGenuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(In Thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\n41\nGenuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness\nGenuine Parts Company is a distributor of automotive replacement parts and industrial parts and materials. We serve a diverse customer base through a network of more than\n10,700\nlocations throughout North America, Europe, and Australasia and, therefore, have limited exposure from credit losses to any particular customer, region, or industry segment. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral.\nWe have evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include all of our accounts. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is not material to our consolidated net income. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the differences could be material.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe primarily recognize revenue at the point the customer obtains control of the products or services and at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received for those products or services.\nRevenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, variable consideration and any taxes collected from customers that will be remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue recognized over time is not significant. Payment terms with customers vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. We do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of significant financing components based on the expectation that the period between when we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Arrangements with customers that include payment terms extending beyond one year are not significant. Liabilities for customer incentives, discounts, or rebates are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nProduct Distribution Revenues\nWe generate revenue primarily by distributing products through wholesale and retail channels. For wholesale customers, revenue is recognized when title and control of the goods has passed to the wholesale customer. Retail revenue is recognized at the point of sale when the goods are transferred to customers and consideration is received. Shipping and handling activities are performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the products. Costs associated with shipping and handling to our customers are considered costs to fulfill a contract and are included in selling, administrative and other expenses in the period they are incurred.\nOther Revenues\nWe offer software support, product cataloging, marketing, training and other membership program and support services to certain customers. This revenue is recognized as services are performed. Revenue from these services is recognized over a short duration and the impact to our consolidated financial statements is not significant.\nVariable Consideration\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return and may include variable consideration in the form of incentives, discounts, credits or rebates. We estimate variable consideration based on historical experience to determine the expected amount to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We recognize estimated variable consideration as an adjustment to the transaction price when control of the related product or service is transferred. The realization of variable consideration occurs within a short period of time from product delivery; therefore, the time value of money effect is not significant.\n42\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of our foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars at the current and average exchange rates, respectively. The foreign currency translation adjustment is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.\nTrade Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe evaluate the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on various factors, including historical experience, current economic conditions and future expected credit losses and collectability trends. We will periodically adjust this estimate when we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While we have a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which we operate could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately $\n26\nmillion, $\n20\nmillion, and $\n18\nmillion, respectively. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $\n57\nmillion and $\n54\nmillion, respectively.\nMerchandise Inventories, Including Consideration Received From Vendors\nMerchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for a majority of U.S. automotive and industrial parts, and generally by the weighted average method for non-U.S. and certain other inventories. If the FIFO method had been used in place of LIFO, cost would have been approximately $\n880\nmillion and $\n835\nmillion higher than reported at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Reductions in certain industrial parts inventories resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory layers, which reduced cost of goods sold by immaterial amounts in 2023 and 2021. There were\nno\nliquidations of LIFO inventory layers in 2022.\nWe identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimate appropriate provisions related thereto. Historically, these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of our inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. While we have no reason to believe our inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, our risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur.\nWe enter into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of our vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives. Generally, we earn inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria. We accrue for the receipt of these incentives as part of our inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year. While management believes we will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2024 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist primarily of consideration receivable from vendors, prepaid expenses, income taxes and other miscellaneous receivables.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of prepaid expenses and other current assets reported within the consolidated balance sheets at December 31:\nConsideration receivable from vendors include rebates receivable for various vendor funding programs.\n43\nGoodwill\nWe review our goodwill annually for impairment in the fourth quarter, or sooner if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or a level below an operating segment (a component). A component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information and operating results are available and management regularly reviews that information. However, we may aggregate two or more components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics.\nTo review goodwill at a reporting unit for impairment, we generally elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include adverse macroeconomic, industry or market conditions, cost factors, or financial performance. If we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment or conclude from our assessment of qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must perform a quantitative test to evaluate goodwill impairment.\nTo perform a quantitative test, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that amount to the reporting unit's carrying value. We typically calculate the fair value by using a combination of a market approach and an income approach that is based on a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions used in the market approach generally include benchmark company market multiples and the assumptions used in the income approach generally include the projected cash flows of the reporting unit, which are based on projected revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, the estimated weighted average cost of capital, working capital and terminal value. We use inputs and assumptions we believe are consistent with those a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. We recognize goodwill impairment (if any) as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nRefer to the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Footnote for further information on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing.\nLong-Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill\nWe assess our long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. To analyze recoverability, we project undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets. If these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment would be recognized, resulting in a write-down of assets with a corresponding charge to\nearnings\n. Impairment losses, if any, are measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets.\nThere were\nno\nimpairment losses in 2023. In 2022 and 2021, we recognized losses related to impairments and disposals of $\n17\nmillion and $\n61\nmillion, respectively. Refer to the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Footnote and the Property, Plant and Equipment Footnote for more information on the losses that occurred in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOther Assets\nOther assets consist primarily of cash surrender value of life insurance policies, equity method and other investments, guarantee fees receivable, and deferred compensation benefits.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are primarily determined on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives of each asset: buildings,\n10\nto\n40\nyears; machinery and equipment,\n5\nto\n15\nyears; software,\n3\nto\n5\nyears; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements.\nOther Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities consist primarily of current lease obligations, allowances for sales returns expected within the next year, accrued compensation, accrued income and other taxes, and other reserves for expenses incurred.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities consist primarily of allowances for sales returns expected after the next year, guarantee obligations, accrued taxes and other non-current obligations.\nSelf-Insurance\nWe are self-insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs. A reserve for claims incurred but not reported is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by our claims administrators. These reserves are\n44\nincluded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year.\nLong-term insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for our workers’ compensation program. We carry high deductible policies for a majority of these liabilities. We record our reserves based on an analysis performed by an independent actuary. The analysis involves calculating loss development factors and applying them to reserves supplied by our insurance providers. While we believe the assumptions used in these calculations are appropriate, significant changes in actual experience or our assumptions could materially affect the worker’s compensation costs and reserves recorded.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire businesses, we apply the acquisition method of accounting and recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date, which requires significant estimates and assumptions. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method requires us to record provisional amounts for any items for which the accounting is not complete at the end of a reporting period. We must complete the accounting during the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year. Adjustments made during the measurement period could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe typically measure customer relationships and other intangible assets using an income approach. Significant estimates and assumptions used in this approach include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset (e.g., future revenue growth rates and EBITDA Margin). If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired tangible and intangible assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased, or the acquired asset could be impaired.\nLegal and Product Liabilities\nWe accrue for potential losses related to legal disputes, litigation, product liabilities, and regulatory matters when it is probable (the future event or events are likely to occur) that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nThe product liability amount reflects our reasonable estimate of losses based upon currently known facts. To calculate the liability, we estimate potential losses relating to pending claims and also estimates the likelihood of additional, similar claims being filed against us in the future. To estimate potential losses on claims that could be filed in the future, we consider claims pending against us, claim filing rates, the number of codefendants and the extent to which they share in settlements, and the amount of loss by claim type. The estimated losses for pending and potential future claims are calculated on a discounted basis using risk-free interest rates derived from market data about monetary assets with maturities comparable to those of the projected product liabilities. We use an actuarial specialist to assist with measuring our product liabilities.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Additionally, ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurements\n, defines levels within a hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs.\n•\nLevel 1- Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\n•\nLevel 2- Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\n•\nLevel 3- Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of our senior unsecured notes was approximately $\n3.7\nbillion and $\n2.9\nbillion, respectively, which are designated as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Our valuation technique is based primarily on prices and other relevant information generated by observable transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\n45\nDerivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and are designated as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. They are valued using inputs other than quoted prices, such as foreign exchange rates and yield curves.\nFair value measurements of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities are primarily used in the impairment analyses of goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets. These involve fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, and borrowings under the line of credit approximate their respective fair values based on the short-term nature of these instruments.\nFair value measurement using unobservable inputs is inherently uncertain, and the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used since December 31, 2022.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nWe are exposed to various risks arising from business operations and market conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates and certain foreign currencies. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative and non-derivative instruments as risk management tools to mitigate the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks. The objective of using these tools is to reduce fluctuations in our earnings, cash flows and net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries associated with changes in these rates. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. We have not historically incurred, and do not expect to incur in the future, any losses as a result of counterparty default related to derivative instruments.\nWe formally document relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow to be paid. We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivative and non-derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items. When a designated instrument is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs are classified as selling, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and totaled approximately $\n451\nmillion, $\n407\nmillion, and $\n350\nmillion, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $\n234\nmillion, $\n236\nmillion, and $\n211\nmillion in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nAccounting for Legal Costs\nWe expense legal costs related to loss contingencies as they are incurred.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe maintain various long-term incentive plans, which provide for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), restricted stock, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance awards, dividend equivalents and other share-based awards. SARs represent a right to receive upon exercise an amount, payable in shares of common stock, equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise over the base value of the grant. The terms of such SARs require net settlement in shares of common stock and do not provide for cash settlement. RSUs represent a contingent right to receive\none\nshare of our common stock at a future date. The majority of awards previously granted vest on a pro-rata basis for periods ranging from\none\nto\nthree years\nand are expensed accordingly on a straight-line basis. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. We issue new shares upon exercise or conversion of awards under these plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes. In addition, valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be\n46\nrealized. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income, future reversals of existing temporary differences, recent financial operations and tax planning strategies.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.\nNet Income per Common Share\nBasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted net income per common share includes the dilutive effect of stock options, stock appreciation rights and nonvested restricted stock awards options. Options to purchase approximately\n3\nthousand,\n4\nthousand, and\n186\nthousand shares of common stock ranging from $\n72\n- $\n179\nper share were outstanding at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These options were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per common share because the options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market prices of common stock in each respective year.\nThe following table summarizes basic and diluted shares outstanding for the year ended December 31:\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nChanges to U.S. GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in the form of Accounting Standard Updates (“ASUs”) to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs and any not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are expected to have a minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n.\nThis standard removes certain exceptions for performing intraperiod tax allocations, requires recognition of deferred taxes for investments, and requires calculating income taxes in interim periods. The guidance also simplifies the accounting for franchise taxes, transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effect of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in interim periods. We adopted ASU 2019-12 as of January 1, 2021, and recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase opening retained earnings by $\n6\nmillion.\nLiabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. This standard requires disclosure of the key terms of outstanding supply chain finance programs and a rollforward of the related amounts due to vendors participating in these programs. The new standard does not affect the recognition, measurement or financial statement presentation of any amounts due. The guidance was effective in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective for our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024. We adopted ASU 2022-04, including the early adoption of the rollforward, during the year ended December 31, 2023. For additional information, refer to the Supply Chain Finance Programs Footnote.\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This standard requires disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of other segment items by reportable segment, and all annual disclosures\n47\ncurrently required by Topic 280 to be included in interim periods. The guidance is effective for our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and subsequent interim periods, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The standard requires disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and additional information for reconciling items, income before tax expense disaggregated between domestic and foreign,  income tax expense disaggregated by federal, state and foreign, as well as further information on income taxes paid. The guidance is effective for our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our financial statements and disclosures.\n2.\nSegment Data\nOur reportable segments consist of the Automotive Parts Group (\"Automotive\") and Industrial Parts Group (\"Industrial\"). Within the reportable segments, certain of our operating segments are aggregated since they have similar economic characteristics, products and services, type and class of customers, and distribution methods.\nOur Automotive segment distributes replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all makes and models of automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles.\nOur Industrial segment distributes a wide variety of industrial bearings, mechanical and fluid power transmission equipment, including hydraulic and pneumatic products, material handling components and related parts and supplies.\nInter-segment sales are not significant. Segment profit for each industry segment is calculated as net sales less costs of goods sold, operating expenses, and certain non-operating expenses attributable to the segment (e.g., foreign currency), excluding general corporate expenses, net interest expense, intangible asset amortization, and other unallocated amounts that are primarily driven by corporate initiatives. Approximately $\n577\nmillion, $\n472\nmillion, and $\n438\nmillion of income before income taxes were generated in jurisdictions outside the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Net sales and net property, plant and equipment by country relate directly to our operations in the respective country. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents and headquarters’ facilities and equipment.\nThe following table presents a summary of our reportable segment financial information:\n48\nThe following table presents a summary of the other unallocated costs:\n(1)\nAmount reflects a gain on the sale of real estate that had been leased to S.P. Richards.\n(2)\nAmount reflects insurance recoveries in excess of losses incurred on inventory, property, plant and equipment and other fire-related costs.\n(3)\nAmount to remeasure product liability for a revised estimate of the number of claims to be incurred in future periods, among other assumptions.\n(4)\nAmount reflects damages reinstated by the Washington Supreme Court order on July 8, 2021 in connection with a 2017 automotive product liability claim.\n(5)\nAmount reflects a loss on an internally developed software project that was disposed of due to a change in management strategy related to advances in alternative technologies.\n(6)\nAdjustment relates to gains recognized upon remeasurement of certain equity investments to fair value upon acquiring the remaining equity of those entities.\n(7)\nAmount for 2022 primarily includes costs of $\n67\nmillion associated with the January 3, 2022 acquisition and integration of KDG which includes a $\n17\nmillion impairment charge. The impairment charge was driven by a decision to retire certain legacy trade names, classified as other intangible assets, prior to the end of their estimated useful lives as part of executing our KDG integration and rebranding strategy. Separately, this adjustment includes an $\n11\nmillion loss related to an investment. Amount for 2021 includes transaction and other costs related to acquisitions.\nThe following table presents a summary of our reportable segment total assets:\n49\nThe following table presents a summary of select financial information by reportable segment:\nNet sales are disaggregated by geographical region for each of our reportable segments, as we deem this presentation best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of net sales and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nThe following table presents disaggregated geographical net sales from contracts with customers by reportable segment:\n50\n3.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 by reportable segment, as well as other identifiable intangible assets, are summarized as follows:\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2023. We assess the value of our goodwill under either a quantitative or qualitative assessment for our various reporting units. To complete a qualitative assessment, we evaluate historical revenue and operating profit growth trends, market conditions and other factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's goodwill is impaired. We complete quantitative assessments for reporting units that fail our qualitative assessments, or otherwise on a periodic basis. To complete a quantitative assessment, we calculate a reporting unit's fair value using a combination of income and market approaches, which involve significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). In the income approach, we primarily use these assumptions: projected revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins, the estimated weighted average cost of capital, and terminal value. In the market approach, we primarily use benchmark company market multiples. We believe the inputs and assumptions we use are consistent with those a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Once calculated, we verify whether the reporting unit's fair value is higher than its carrying amount. If the fair value is lower, we recognize an impairment, generally for the difference. Based on these assessments, we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during 2023 or 2022.\nIf there are sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions in future periods affecting the projected earnings and cash flows at our reporting units, among other things, there can be no assurance that goodwill at one or more reporting units may not be impaired.\nIn June 2022, we recognized a $\n17\nmillion non-cash impairment charge related to our decision to retire certain legacy Industrial trade names, classified as other intangible assets, prior to the end of their estimated useful lives as part of the KDG integration and rebranding strategy. We evaluate other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators annually, or more frequently if circumstances change.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization relating to other intangible assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n51\nAmortization expense for other intangible assets totaled $\n147\nmillion, $\n157\nmillion, and $\n103\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nEstimated other intangible assets amortization expense for the succeeding five years is as follows (in thousands):\n4.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, consisted of the following:\n5.\nAccounts Receivable Sales Agreement\nWe have an A/R sales agreement to sell short-term receivables from certain customer trade accounts to the unaffiliated financial institutions on a revolving basis. The A/R Sales Agreement has a\n3\nyear term, which we intend to renew.\nAs part of the A/R Sales Agreement, we routinely sell designated pools of receivables as they are originated by it and certain U.S. subsidiaries to a separate bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity (“SPE”). The assets of the SPE would be first available to satisfy the creditor claims of the unaffiliated financial institutions. We control and therefore consolidate the SPE in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe SPE transferred ownership and control of certain receivables that met certain qualifying conditions to the unaffiliated financial institutions in exchange for cash. We account for transactions with the unaffiliated financial institutions as sales of financial assets, with the associated receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet. The remaining receivables held by the SPE were pledged to secure the collectability of the sold receivables. The amount of receivables pledged as collateral as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is approximately $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion, respectively.\nWe continue to be involved with the receivables transferred by the SPE to the unaffiliated financial institutions by providing collection services. As cash is collected on sold receivables, the SPE continuously transfers ownership and control of new qualifying receivables to the unaffiliated financial institutions so that the total principal amount outstanding of receivables sold is approximately $\n1.0\nbillion at any point in time (which is the maximum amount allowed under the agreement). The future amount of receivables outstanding as sold could decrease, based on the level of activity and other factors. Total principal amount outstanding of receivables sold is approximately $\n1.0\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the activity and amounts outstanding under the A/R Sales Agreement as of period end:\nContinuous cash activity related to the A/R Sales Agreement is reflected in cash from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nThe SPE incurs fees due to the unaffiliated financial institutions related to the accounts receivable sales transactions. Those fees, which totaled $\n60\nmillion, $\n27\nmillion, and $\n11\nmillion in 2023, 2022, and 2021,\n52\nrespectively, are recorded within other non-operating expense (income) in the consolidated statements of income. The SPE has a recourse obligation to repurchase from the unaffiliated financial institutions any previously sold receivables that are not collected due to the occurrence of certain events, including credit quality deterioration and customer sales returns. The reserve recognized for this recourse obligation as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is not material. The servicing liability related to our collection services also is not material, given the high quality of the customers underlying the receivables and the anticipated short collection period.\n6.\nDebt\nThe weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings was approximately\n3.16\n% and\n2.33\n% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCertain borrowings require us to comply with a financial covenant with respect to a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, we also had unused letters of credit of approximately $\n71\nmillion outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOn November 1, 2023, we issued $\n425\nmillion of unsecured\n6.50\n% Senior Notes due 2028. Simultaneously, we issued $\n375\nmillion of unsecured\n6.88\n% Senior Notes due 2033. For both offerings, interest is payable semi-annually on November 1 and May 1 of each year, beginning May 1, 2024. We utilized the proceeds from these offerings to repay the Series F Private Placement Notes and outstanding indebtedness under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and for other general corporate purposes.\nOn November 29, 2023, we established a commercial paper program that allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to $\n1.5\nbillion outstanding. The maturities of the commercial paper notes vary but may not exceed\n364\ndays from the date of issuance. The commercial paper notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and will rank pari passu with unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are issued at par less a discount representing an interest factor or, if interest bearing, at par. The net proceeds of issuances of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2023, we had\nno\nborrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program.\n53\nThe following table summarizes our debt as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nThe following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our debt for the years succeeding December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n54\n7.\nSupply Chain Finance Programs\nSeveral global financial institutions offer voluntary supply chain finance (“SCF”) programs which enable our suppliers (generally those that grant extended terms), at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from us to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that takes advantage of our credit rating and may be beneficial to them. We and our suppliers agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers range from\n30\nto\n360\ndays. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to us and they issue the associated invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. In turn, we direct payment to the financial institutions, rather than the suppliers, for the invoices sold to the financial institutions. No guarantees are provided by us or any of our subsidiaries on third-party performance under the SCF program; however, we guarantee the payment by our subsidiaries to the financial institutions participating in the SCF program for the applicable invoices. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in the line item\naccounts payable\nin our consolidated balance sheets.\nAll activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\n8.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe have designated certain derivative instruments and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, as hedges of the foreign currency exchange rate exposure of our Euro-denominated net investment in a European subsidiary. We apply the spot method to assess the hedge effectiveness of the derivative instruments and this assessment for each instrument excludes the initial value related to the difference at contract inception between the foreign exchange spot rate and the forward rate (i.e., the forward points). The initial value of this excluded component is recognized as a reduction to interest expense in a systematic and rational manner over the term of the derivative instrument. All other changes in value for the net investment hedges are included in AOCL within foreign currency translation and would only be reclassified to earnings if the European subsidiary were liquidated, or otherwise disposed. Upon settlement, the cash paid or received generally is reflected in investing activities in the statement of cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes the location and carrying amounts of the derivative instruments and the foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, that are designated and qualify as part of hedging relationships (in thousands):\n55\nThe table below presents pre-tax gains and losses related to net investment hedges for the year ended December 31:\n9.\nLeased Properties\nWe primarily lease real estate for retail stores, branches, distribution centers, office space and land. We also lease equipment (primarily vehicles).\nMost real estate leases include\none\nor more options to renew, with renewal terms that generally can extend the lease term from\none\nto\n20\nyears or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our discretion. We evaluate renewal options at lease inception and on an ongoing basis, and include renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise in the expected lease terms when classifying leases and measuring lease liabilities. We elected a policy of not recording leases on the consolidated balance sheets when the leases have a term of 12 months or less and we are not reasonably certain to elect an option to purchase the leased asset. Lease agreements generally do not require material variable lease payments, residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nThe table below presents the locations of the operating lease assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets:\nThe depreciable lives of operating lease assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term.\nOur leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate we would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment. We used incremental borrowing rates as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date.\nOur weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for operating leases are:\n56\nThe table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under noncancelable operating leases with terms of more than one year to the total operating lease liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nFuture minimum lease payments include $\n52\nmillion related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Future minimum lease payments exclude $\n77\nmillion related to operating leases that have not yet commenced. These leases are expected to commence in 2024 with lease terms of\n3\nto\n15\nyears.\nThe table below presents operating lease costs and supplemental cash flow information related to leases:\nOperating lease costs are included within selling, administrative and other expenses on the consolidated statements of income. Short-term lease costs, variable lease costs and sublease income were not material for the periods presented. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities is included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n10.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nOur defined benefit pension plans cover employees in the U.S., Canada, and Europe who meet eligibility requirements. The plan covering U.S. employees is noncontributory, and our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan was frozen as of December 31, 2013. No further benefits were provided after this date for additional credited service or earnings, and all participants became fully vested as of December 31, 2013. The Canadian plan is contributory, and benefits are based on career average compensation. Our funding policy is to contribute an amount equal to the minimum required contribution under applicable pension legislation. For the plans in the U.S. and Canada, we may increase our contribution above the minimum, if appropriate to our tax and cash position and the plans’ funded position. The European plans are funded in accordance with local regulations.\nWe also sponsor supplemental retirement plans covering employees in the U.S. and Canada. We use a measurement date of December 31 for our pension and supplemental retirement plans.\nSeveral assumptions are used to determine the benefit obligations, plan assets, and net periodic income. The discount rate for the U.S. pension plan is calculated using a bond matching approach to select specific bonds that would satisfy the projected benefit payments. The bond matching approach reflects the process that would be used to settle the pension obligations. The discount rate for non U.S. plans are set by using Willis Towers Watson's RATE:Link model. For each plan, this approach reflects yields available on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay the plan's benefits when due. The expected return on plan assets is based on a calculated market-related value of plan assets, where gains and losses on plan assets are amortized over a\nfive year\nperiod and accumulate in other comprehensive income. Other non-investment unrecognized gains and losses are amortized in future net income based on a “corridor” approach, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year. The unrecognized gains and losses in excess of the corridor criteria are amortized over the average future lifetime or service of plan participants, depending on the plan. These assumptions are updated at each annual measurement date.\n57\nChanges in benefit obligations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were:\nThe benefit obligations for our U.S. pension plans included in the above were $\n1.7\nbillion and $\n1.7\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., Canada, and Europe was approximately $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n1.9\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor the U.S. pension plan, there was a net actuarial liability loss of $\n50\nmillion and an asset gain of $\n47\nmillion. The liability loss was comprised primarily from a decrease in the discount rate. For the U.S. supplemental retirement plan, there was a net actuarial liability loss of $\n20\nmillion. The liability loss is the result of a $\n5\nmillion loss associated with a decrease in the discount rate, an $\n11.2\nmillion demographic loss related to new entrants, and an $\n8.5\nmillion loss associated with higher than expected incentive payouts.These losses were offset by updates that were made to other assumptions, including termination rates, retirement rates, percent married, spouse age difference, and benefit payment form elected based on the results of an experience study performed during 2023. The net impact of these updates is a gain of $\n4.8\nmillion.\nThe assumptions used to measure the pension benefit obligations for the plans at December 31, 2023 and 2022, were:\nChanges in plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were:\nThe fair values of plan assets for our U.S. pension plans included in the above were $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n1.9\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n58\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were as follows:\nThe asset allocations for our funded pension plans at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the target allocation for 2024, by asset category were:\nOur benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the funds. The plans in Europe are unfunded and, therefore, there are no plan assets. The pension plan strategy implemented by our management is to achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada as well as fiduciary standards. The long-term primary investment objectives for the pension plans are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital, without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power, and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long-term rates of return. Our investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (\n38\n% U.S. Large-cap stocks,\n4\n% U.S. Mid-cap stocks,\n5\n% U.S. Small-cap stocks,\n10\n% International stocks,\n3\n% Emerging Market stocks and\n40\n% Barclays U.S. Gov/Credit Index).\nThe fair values of the plan assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, by asset category, are shown in the tables below. Various inputs are considered when determining the value of our pension plan assets. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. Level 1 represents observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 represents other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.). Level 3 represents significant unobservable inputs (including our own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments). Certain investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value (\"NAV\") per share as a practical expedient and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe valuation methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded on the last day of the calendar plan year. Debt securities including corporate bonds, U.S. Government securities, and asset-backed securities are valued using price evaluations reflecting the bid and/or ask sides of the market for an investment as of the last day of the calendar plan year.\n59\n60\nEquity securities include Genuine Parts Company common stock in the amounts of $\n209\nmillion (\n9\n% of total plan assets) and $\n262\nmillion (\n12\n% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Dividend payments received by the plan on company stock totaled approximately $\n6\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Fees paid during the year for services rendered by parties in interest were based on customary and reasonable rates for such services.\nBased on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as an asset study that was performed based on our asset allocations and future expectations, our expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2024 pension income is\n7.61\n% for the plans. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of our benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships.\nThe following table sets forth the funded status of the plans and the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31:\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of:\n61\nThe following table reflects the total benefits expected to be paid from the pension plans’ or our assets. Of the pension benefits expected to be paid in 2024, approximately $\n13\nmillion is expected to be paid from employer assets. Expected employer contributions below reflect amounts expected to be contributed to funded plans.\nInformation about the expected cash flows for the pension plans follows (in thousands):\nNet periodic benefit income included the following components:\nService cost is recorded in selling, administrative and other expenses in the consolidated statements of income while all other components are recorded within other non-operating expenses (income). Pension benefits also include amounts related to supplemental retirement plans.\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:\nThe assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit income for the plans follow:\nWe have\none\ndefined contribution plan in the U.S. that covers substantially all of our domestic employees. Employees receive a matching contribution of\n100\n% of the first\n5\n% of the employees’ salary.\nTotal plan expense was approximately $\n77\nmillion in 2023, $\n69\nmillion in 2022, and $\n60\nmillion in 2021.\n62\n11.\nAcquisitions\nFor each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of their respective acquisition dates. The results of operations for acquired businesses are included in our consolidated statements of income beginning on their respective acquisition dates.\n2023\nWe acquired several businesses for approximately $\n322\nmillion, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2023. Approximately $\n300\nmillion was related to our Automotive segment and $\n22\nmillion was related to Industrial. During the year we recognized approximately $\n389\nmillion and $\n48\nmillion of sales, net of store closures, related to our 2023 Automotive and Industrial acquisitions, respectively. We recognized approximately $\n219\nmillion of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with these acquisitions. Other intangible assets acquired of $\n99\nmillion consisted of customer relationships with a weighted average amortization life of\n20\nyears.\nWe did not recognize any significant measurement period adjustments related to finalizing acquisition accounting during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n2022\nWe acquired several businesses for approximately $\n1.6\nbillion, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2022. Approximately $\n1.3\nbillion was related to our Industrial segment, primarily the acquisition of KDG discussed further below, and $\n300\nmillion was related to Automotive.\nWe recognized approximately $\n562\nmillion of sales, net of store closures, and $\n239\nmillion of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our Automotive acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022. The other intangible assets acquired consisted of customer relationships of $\n76\nmillion, trademarks of $\n9\nmillion, and other intangibles of $\n4\nmillion with weighted average amortization lives of\n18\n,\n15\n, and\n3\nyears, respectively.\nOn January 3, 2022, the company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Motion Industries, Inc., acquired all of the equity interests in KDG for a purchase price of approximately $\n1.3\nbillion in cash, net of cash acquired of approximately $\n30\nmillion. KDG contributed approximately\n5\n% of net sales included in our consolidated statement of income from January 3, 2022 to December 31, 2022. The KDG acquisition was financed using a combination of borrowing under the existing unsecured revolving credit facility, proceeds of $\n200\nmillion from the selling of additional receivables under our amended A/R Sales Agreement, and $\n109\nmillion of cash.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date for the KDG acquisition as well as adjustments made when finalizing the acquisition accounting during the year ended December 31, 2022 (referred to as the \"measurement period adjustments\"). The measurement period adjustments primarily resulted from revisions to the valuation of inventory and intangible assets, deferred taxes, and long-term liabilities.\n63\nThe other intangible assets acquired included $\n527\nmillion of customer relationship intangibles and a $\n41\nmillion favorable trade name licensing agreement, with amortization lives of\n17\nand\n1.5\nyears, respectively. The other intangible assets have a total weighted amortization life of\n16\nyears. We used the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach to measure KDG's customer relationships, which is sensitive to certain assumptions including discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis for the forecasted results (e.g., future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins). These assumptions are forward-looking in nature and are dependent on the future performance of the acquired business and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nThe goodwill was assigned to the Industrial segment and is attributable primarily to expected synergies and the assembled workforce. Approximately $\n261\nmillion of the goodwill recognized as part of the acquisition was tax deductible.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, approximately $\n5\nmillion of inventory amortization step-up cost related to this acquisition was included in cost of goods sold. Further, $\n62\nmillion of transaction and other one-time costs, inclusive of an impairment charge, were included in selling, administrative, and other expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Refer to the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Footnote for more information on the impairment charge.\nIf the KDG acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2021 and if its results of operations had been included in our consolidated results since that date, our unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income would have reflected net sales of approximately $\n22.1\nbillion and $\n19.9\nbillion and net income on a per share diluted basis of $\n8.47\nand $\n6.02\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that we would have reported had the transaction actually occurred at the beginning of this period, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.\nThe adjustments to the pro forma amounts include, but are not limited to, applying our accounting policies, amortization related to fair value adjustments to intangible assets, one-time acquisition accounting adjustments, interest expense on acquisition related debt and debt not assumed, and any associated tax effects. The pro forma results do not include any cost savings or other synergies that may result from the acquisition.\nEarnings related to KDG included in our consolidated statement of income from January 3, 2022 to December 31, 2022 are impracticable to provide due to KDG’s ongoing integration into Motion, which commenced shortly after the acquisition date.\n2021\nWe acquired several businesses for approximately $\n282\nmillion, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n64\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $\n220\nmillion and $\n25\nmillion of sales, net of store closures, related to our 2021 Automotive and Industrial acquisitions, respectively. We recognized approximately $\n160\nmillion of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the 2021 acquisitions. Other intangible assets acquired consisted of customer relationships with a weighted average amortization life of\n20\nyears.\nWe did not recognize any significant measurement period adjustments related to finalizing acquisition accounting for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n12.\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation costs of $\n57\nmillion, $\n38\nmillion, and $\n26\nmillion, were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The total income tax benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of income for share-based compensation arrangements were approximately $\n15\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion, and $\n7\nmillion for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2023, total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was approximately $\n60\nmillion. There have been no modifications to valuation methodologies or methods during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were\n7\nmillion shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future equity-based compensation awards.\nA summary of our restricted stock units activity and related information is as follows:\nA summary of our stock appreciation rights activity and related information is as follows:\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of SARs exercised and RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $\n89\nmillion, $\n62\nmillion, and $\n73\nmillion, respectively. The fair value of RSUs is based on the price of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value of SARs is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. We ceased issuing SARs in 2017. The total fair value of SARs and RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $\n41\nmillion, $\n29\nmillion, and $\n25\nmillion, respectively.\n65\n13.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following tables present the changes in AOCL by component:\nThe AOCL components related to the pension benefits are included in the computation of net periodic benefit income in the Employee Benefit Plans Footnote. The nature of the cash flow hedges are discussed in the Derivatives and Hedging Footnote. Generally, tax effects in AOCL are established at the currently enacted tax rate and reclassified to net income in the same period that the related pre-tax AOCL reclassifications are recognized.\n66\n14.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nWe currently hold approximately $\n170\nmillion in gross net operating losses, of which approximately $\n81\nmillion will carry forward indefinitely. The remaining net operating losses of approximately $\n89\nmillion will begin to expire in 2024.\nThe components of income before income taxes are as follows:\nThe components of income tax expense are as follows:\n67\nThe reasons for the difference between total tax expense and the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes are as follows:\n(1)\nU.S. statutory rates applied to income are as follows: 2023, 2022 and 2021 at 21%.\n(2)\nOur effective tax rate reflects the impact of having operations outside of the U.S. which are taxed at statutory rates different from the U.S. statutory rate, with some income being fully or partially exempt from income taxes due to various operating and financing activities.\nWe account for Global Intangible Low Taxed income in the year the tax is incurred as a period cost.\nWe, or one of our subsidiaries, file income tax returns in the U.S., various states, and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020 or subject to foreign income tax examinations for years ended prior to 2013. We are currently under audit in some of our state and foreign jurisdictions. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits recognized in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not possible to estimate the effect, if any, of the amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recognized uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits; however, we do not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next 12 months.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nThe amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $\n22\nmillion and $\n21\nmillion, respectively, of which approximately $\n20\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion, respectively, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\nDuring the tax years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we paid, received refunds, or accrued insignificant interest and penalties. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we estimate that we have an outside basis difference in certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $\n1.2\nbillion, which includes the cumulative undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. We continue to be indefinitely reinvested in this outside basis difference. Determining the amount of net unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis difference in these entities is not practicable. This is due to the complexities associated with the calculation to determine residual taxes on the undistributed earnings, including the availability of foreign tax credits, applicability of any additional local withholding tax and other indirect tax consequences that may arise due to the distribution of these earnings.\nIn 2023, certain countries have enacted legislation and implemented policies resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project under Pillar Two, which establishes a global 15% per-country minimum tax. The rules are applicable for fiscal years starting on or\n68\nafter December 31, 2023. We estimate an immaterial impact to the tax provision related to the Pillar Two legislation in 2024 and will continue to monitor implementation in the countries in which we operate.\n15.\nGuarantees\nWe guarantee the borrowings of certain independently controlled automotive parts stores and businesses (“independents”) and certain other affiliates in which we have a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (“affiliates”). Presently, the independents are generally consolidated by unaffiliated enterprises that have controlling financial interests through ownership of a majority voting interest in the independents. We have no voting interest or equity conversion rights in any of the independents. We do not control the independents or the affiliates but receive a fee for the guarantees. We have concluded that the independents are variable interest entities, but that we are not the primary beneficiary. Specifically, the equity holders of the independents have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance including, but not limited to, decisions about hiring and terminating personnel, local marketing and promotional initiatives, pricing and selling activities, credit decisions, monitoring and maintaining appropriate inventories, and store hours. Separately, we concluded that the affiliates are not variable interest entities. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to our guarantees. While such borrowings of the independents and affiliates are outstanding, we are required to maintain compliance with certain covenants. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nAt December 31, 2023, the total borrowings of the independents and affiliates subject to guarantee by us were approximately $\n954\nmillion. These loans generally mature over periods from\none\nto\nsix years\n. We regularly monitor the performance of these loans and the ongoing operating results, financial condition and ratings from credit rating agencies of the independents and affiliates that participate in the guarantee programs.\nIn the event that we are required to make payments in connection with these guarantees, we would obtain and liquidate certain collateral pledged by the independents or affiliates (e.g., accounts receivable and inventory) to recover all or a substantial portion of the amounts paid under the guarantees. We recognize a liability equal to current expected credit losses over the lives of the loans in the guaranteed loan portfolio, based on a consideration of historical experience, current conditions, the nature and expected value of any collateral, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. To date, we have had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings and the current expected credit loss reserve is not material. As of December 31, 2023, there are no material guaranteed loans for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and recovery is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.\nWe have recognized certain assets and liabilities amounting to $\n59\nmillion and $\n67\nmillion for the guarantees related to the independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities relate to our noncontingent obligation to stand ready to perform under the guarantee programs and they are distinct from our current expected credit loss reserve.\n16.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLegal Matters\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings, many involving routine litigation incidental to the businesses, including approximately\n2,451\npending product liability lawsuits resulting from our national distribution of automotive parts and supplies. Many of these involve claims of personal injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts we distributed. The amount accrued for pending and future claims was $\n244\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, which represented our best estimate of the liability within our calculated range of $\n196\nmillion to $\n277\nmillion, discounted using a discount rate of\n3.88\n%. The amount accrued for pending and future claims was $\n220\nmillion as of December 31, 2022, which represented our best estimate of the liability within our calculated range of $\n190\nmillion to $\n270\nmillion, discounted using a discount rate of\n3.83\n%. Our undiscounted product liability was $\n308\nmillion and $\n285\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe amounts recognized are based on the best available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. While litigation of any type contains an element of uncertainty, we believe that our insurance coverage and our defense, and ultimate resolution of pending and reasonably anticipated claims will continue to occur within the ordinary course of our business and that resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOn April 17, 2017, a jury awarded damages against the company of $\n82\nmillion in a litigated automotive product liability dispute. Through post-trial motions and offsets from previous settlements, the initial verdict was reduced to $\n77\nmillion. We believed the verdict was not supported by the facts or the law and was contrary to our role in the automotive parts industry. We challenged the verdict through an appeal to a higher court. On February 19, 2020, the\n69\nWashington Court of Appeals issued an order entirely reversing the jury's finding on damages and ordering a new trial on damages. The plaintiffs subsequently appealed this order to the Washington Supreme Court. On July 7, 2020, the Washington Supreme Court indicated that it would consider a further appeal on this matter, and oral arguments occurred on November 10, 2020. On July 8, 2021, the Washington Supreme Court overturned the order of the Washington Court of Appeals and reinstated the trial court's damage award of $\n77\nmillion against the company. We recorded an adjustment to increase selling, administrative and other expenses by approximately $\n77\nmillion, inclusive of statutory interest and insurance coverage, in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. The damage award and statutory interest was fully paid as of December 31, 2021.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nItem 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period.\n17.\nSubsequent Events\nIn February 2024, we approved and announced a global restructuring designed to better align our assets and further improve the efficiency of the business. This initiative includes an announced voluntary retirement offer in the U.S., along with a rationalization and optimization of certain distribution centers, stores and other facilities. We expect to incur costs of between $\n100\nmillion and $\n200\nmillion related to the restructuring efforts in 2024. We expect to substantially complete the initiative by the end of 2025. The estimated charges that we expect to incur are subject to a number of assumptions, and actual amounts may differ materially from such estimates. We may also incur additional charges not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of these initiatives.\n70"

    "text": "Management’s conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2023, to ensure that material information was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nThe management of Genuine Parts Company and its Subsidiaries (the “company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nOur internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and to the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our published consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\ni. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\nii. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\niii. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, including our CEO and CFO, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (\"COSO\") in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.” Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which also audited our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Ernst & Young LLP's report on our internal control over financial reporting is set forth below.\n71\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion\n.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 22, 2024\n72"
