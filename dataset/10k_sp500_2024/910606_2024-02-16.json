    "text": "Regency Centers Corporation is a fully integrated real estate company and self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust that began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993.  Our corporate headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida.  Regency Centers, L.P. is a subsidiary through which Regency Centers Corporation conducts substantially all of its operations, and which owns, directly or indirectly, substantially all of its assets.  Our business consists of acquiring, developing, owning, and operating income-producing retail real estate principally located in suburban trade areas with compelling demographics within the United States of America (\"USA\" or \"United States\").  We generate revenues by leasing space to necessity, service, convenience, and value-based retailers serving the essential needs of our communities.  Regency has been an S&P 500 Index member since 2017.  Our business experienced material growth in 2023 due to our acquisition of UBP which is further discussed in \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had full or partial ownership interests in 482 properties, primarily anchored by market leading grocery stores, encompassing 56.8 million square feet (\"SF\") of gross leasable area (\"GLA\").  Our Pro-rata share of this GLA is 48.6 million square feet, including our share of properties owned through unconsolidated real estate partnerships.\nWe are a preeminent national owner, operator, and developer of neighborhood and community shopping centers predominantly located in suburban trade areas with compelling demographics that have strategic attributes supporting growth through economic cycles.  Our mission is to create thriving environments for retailers and service providers to connect with surrounding neighborhoods and communities.  Our vision is to elevate quality of life as an integral thread in the fabric of our communities.  Our portfolio includes thriving properties merchandised with highly productive grocers, restaurants, service providers, and best-in-class retailers that connect with their neighborhoods, communities, and customers.\nOur values:\n•\nWe are our people:  Our people are our greatest asset, and we believe that a talented team from diverse backgrounds and experiences makes us better.\n•\nWe do what is right:  We act with unwavering standards of honesty and integrity.\n•\nWe connect with our communities:  We promote philanthropic ideas and strive for the betterment of our neighborhoods by giving our time and financial support.\n•\nWe are responsible:  Our duty is to balance purpose and profit, being good stewards of capital and the environment for the benefit of all our stakeholders.\n•\nWe strive for excellence:  When we are passionate about what we do, it is reflected in our performance.\n•\nWe are better together:  When we listen to each other and our customers, we will succeed together.\n1\nOur goals are to:\n•\nOwn and manage a portfolio of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers anchored primarily by market leading grocers and principally located in suburban trade areas in the most desirable metro areas in the United States.  We believe that this strategy will result in highly desirable and attractive centers with best-in-class retailers.  These centers should command higher rental and occupancy rates resulting in excellent prospects to grow net operating income (\"NOI\");\n•\nCreate shareholder value by increasing earnings and dividends per share that generate total returns at or near the top of our shopping center peers;\n•\nMaintain an industry leading, disciplined development and redevelopment platform to create exceptional retail centers that deliver favorable returns;\n•\nSupport our business activities with a conservative capital structure, including a strong balance sheet with sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs together with a carefully constructed debt maturity profile;\n•\nImplement leading environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") practices through our Corporate Responsibility program to support and enhance our business goals and objectives; and\n•\nEngage and retain an exceptional and diverse team that is guided by our strong values, while fostering an environment of innovation and continuous improvement.\nKey strategies to achieve our goals are to:\n•\nGenerate same property NOI growth that over the long-term consistently ranks at or near the top of our shopping center peers;\n•\nReinvest free cash flow and portfolio enhancement disposition proceeds into high-quality developments, redevelopments and acquisitions in a long term accretive manner;\n•\nMaintain a conservative balance sheet that provides liquidity, financial flexibility and cost-effective funding of investment opportunities, while also managing debt maturities that enable us to weather economic downturns;\n•\nPursue best-in-class ESG programs and practices; and\n•\nAttract, retain, and engage an exceptional and diverse team that is guided by our values while fostering an environment of innovation and continuous improvement.\nCompetition\nWe are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the USA based on revenues, number of properties, GLA, and market capitalization.  There are numerous companies and individuals engaged in our line of business that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that own shopping centers and also anchor some of our shopping centers.  This dynamic results in competition for attracting tenants as well as acquiring existing shopping centers and new development sites.  In addition, brick and mortar shopping centers face continued competition from alternative shopping and delivery methods.  We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by:\n•\nthe market areas in which we operate, and the locations of our shopping centers within those trade areas;\n•\nthe quality of our shopping centers including our strategy of maintaining and renovating these centers to our high standards;\n•\nthe compelling demographics surrounding our shopping centers;\n•\nour relationships with our anchor, shop, and out-parcel tenants;\n•\nour experienced leadership team and cycle-tested expertise; and\n•\nour ability to successfully develop, redevelop, and acquire shopping centers.\n2\nCorporate Responsibility and Human Capital\nTo execute our mission, which is to create thriving environments for retailers and service providers to connect with surrounding neighborhoods and communities, we strive to achieve best-in-class corporate responsibility.  For this reason, corporate responsibility, including our focus on ESG practices that support and enhance our business, is a foundational strategy of Regency.  We believe that alignment of strategy and business sustainability is critical to the long-term success of our Company, our shareholders, the environment, and the communities in which we operate.  To achieve this alignment, our corporate responsibility (which term we use interchangeably with “ESG”) practices are built on four pillars:\n•\nOur People;\n•\nOur Communities;\n•\nEthics and Governance; and\n•\nEnvironmental Stewardship.\nThese practices are guided by three overarching concepts: long-term value creation, our Regency brand and reputation, and the importance of maintaining our culture, which has been a crucial driver of our long-term success.  Our continued commitment to these concepts helps to guide our business strategy, and identify and focus on key corporate responsibility-related drivers that we expect to contribute to our future success.\nWe regularly review our corporate responsibility strategies, goals, and objectives under these four pillars with our Board of Directors (or the \"Board\") and its committees, which oversee our programs.  More information about our corporate responsibility strategy, goals, performance, and reporting, including our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, and our policies and practices related to corporate responsibility, is available on our website at www.regencycenters.com.  The content of our website and other information contained therein, including relating to corporate responsibility, is not incorporated by reference into this Report or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nOur People\n– Our people are our most important asset, and we strive to ensure that they are engaged, passionate about their work, connected to their teams, and supported to deliver their best performance.  Regency recognizes and values the importance to the Company's success of attracting and retaining talented individuals with different skills, backgrounds, and experiences to encourage diversity of thought and ideas.  In addition, we strive to maintain a safe and healthy workspace, promote employee well-being, and empower our employees by focusing on their personal and professional development through training and education opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 497 employees, including 5 part-time employees.  We presently maintain 24 market offices nationwide, including our corporate headquarters in Jacksonville, Florida.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.\nIn 2023, we continued implementing our comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion (\"DEI\") strategy focused on promoting and advancing diversity across our organization.  The goals of this strategy are to attract, recruit, and retain a diverse group of employees to grow, develop, and succeed, as we collectively work to implement our mission and contribute to the long-term success of the organization.  Furthermore, aligned with our near-and long-term human capital goals, we remained focused on employee engagement, leveraging our annual employee survey to identify opportunities to improve and further engage our people.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion -\nWe believe that much of our success is rooted in the diversity and inclusion of our teams and our commitment to a diverse and inclusive culture.  We continue to foster a culture in which everyone is respected, valued, and has an equal opportunity to contribute and thrive.  Our shopping centers are in trade areas throughout the U.S. and our tenants and visitors to our centers represent a cross section of those communities.  We remain focused on building a workforce that represents the many tenants and visitors to our centers we serve and the communities in which we operate.\nOur most recent U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEO-1 survey data can be found on our website, including additional information related to employee gender and ethnic diversity.\nHuman Rights\n– Regency is committed to a workplace free from discrimination and harassment and is focused on advancing fundamental human rights.  Anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training is provided to all employees at orientation, and annually thereafter.\nTalent Attraction and Retention\n– Our core values place a strong importance on our people, which we believe make us an employer of choice.  We understand the importance of attracting and retaining the best talent to sustain our history of success and build long-term value.  We strive to offer some of the most competitive pay and benefits in the industry in which we operate and are continually looking for new opportunities to ensure that we attract and retain our people.\n3\nTraining and Development\n– We strive to provide an environment where our people are connected to their teams, passionate about what they do, and supported to deliver their best efforts and results.  From individual contributors to managers and senior leaders, we want to empower our employees to take control of their career growth and realize their full potential through meaningful training and development opportunities.\nHealth, Safety, and Well-Being\n– The safety, health, and well-being of our people are a top priority for Regency.  We strive to provide a benefit package that is comprehensive, competitive, and thoughtfully designed to attract and retain the best in the business.  We prioritize employee safety at our centers and offices, and require contractors working at our sites to engage in safe work practices.\nOur Communities\n– Our predominately grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers provide many benefits to the communities in which we live and work, including significant local economic impacts in the form of investment, jobs, and taxes.  Our local teams are passionate about investing in and engaging with our communities as they customize and cultivate our centers to create a distinctive environment to bring our tenants and shoppers together for the best retail experience.\nWe believe philanthropy and charitable giving are important elements of our corporate responsibility commitment to the communities in which we operate.  Throughout 2023, Regency supported its employees to serve and invest in community organizations through volunteer and financial support.  Charitable contributions were made directly by the Company, as well as by the vast majority of our employees who donated their time and money to local non-profits directly serving their communities.  Furthermore, as part of our strategy, we continued to improve our communities by investing in property enhancements and placemaking at our new and existing shopping centers.\nEthics and Governance\n– As long-term stewards of our investors’ capital, we are committed to best-in-class corporate governance.  To create long-term value for our stakeholders, we place great emphasis on our culture and core values, the integrity and transparency of our reporting practices, and our overall governance structure in respect of oversight and shareholder rights.\nTo continue to strive for the best achievable mix of skills, experience, backgrounds, tenures, and competencies, including gender, ethnicity, age, and other attributes, Regency’s Board of Directors annually reviews its overall composition and succession planning process.  As an outcome of this process, on September 26, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors elected Kristin A. Campbell to serve as one of the Regency's directors effective January 15, 2023. Ms. Campbell’s skill set, background, experience and competencies align with Regency’s ongoing commitment to board refreshment and best-in-class corporate governance.\nEnvironmental Stewardship\n– We believe sustainability is in the best interest of our investors, tenants, employees, and the communities in which we operate, and we strive to integrate sustainable practices throughout our business.\nWe have identified eight strategic priorities to foster sustainable business practices and minimize both our environmental impact and the long-term risks to Regency’s business: green building, energy efficiency, electric vehicle charging stations, renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) reduction, water conservation, waste management, and climate change as it applies to our real estate portfolio.  We believe these strategic priorities are not only the right thing to do to address environmental concerns such as climate change, resource scarcity and pollution (including GHG emissions reduction), but also support our achievement of key strategic financial and business objectives relating to our operations and development and redevelopment projects.\nThroughout 2023, we continued to make progress towards our target to reduce GHG emissions and collaborate closely with our tenants to minimize their operational environmental impact. Aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), our target aims to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 28% by 2030, measured against a 2019 baseline year, and to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions across all operations by 2050.  In addition, the Company has established targets to enhance energy efficiency, manage water and waste responsibly and invest in renewable energy sources and electric vehicle charging stations. These targets reflect our proactive stance in addressing environmental challenges and contributing to a more sustainable future. Regency’s progress towards these targets, together with our strategy and efforts influenced by climate change, are further described in our  2022 Corporate Responsibility Report.  Based on our current estimates and asset base, we do not expect the pursuit of these targets to materially impact our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a long-term owner, operator, and developer of real estate, we acknowledge the potential for climate change to have a material impact on our properties, people, and long-term success.  Regency wants to ensure that our properties can safely, sustainably, and responsibly withstand the test of time.  We continue to refine our understanding of our exposure to climate-related impacts by conducting ongoing property-level analysis as well as the risks that climate change may pose to our business.\nCompliance with Governmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various regulatory and tax-related requirements within the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Changes to such requirements may result in unanticipated material financial impacts or adverse tax consequences and could materially affect our operating results and financial condition.  Significant regulatory requirements include the laws and regulations described below.\n4\nREIT Laws and Regulations\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the federal income tax laws.  As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders.  Under the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), REITs are subject to numerous regulatory requirements, including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90% of taxable income each year.  We will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income.  We will also generally not qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost.  Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.\nWe have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRS\").  In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Code.  A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes which, to date, have not been material to us.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations (collectively, \"environmental laws\"), we may be liable for some or all of the cost to assess and remediate certain hazardous substances at our shopping centers.  To the extent any environmental issues arise, they most typically stem from the historic practices of current and former dry cleaners, gas stations, and other similar businesses at our centers, as well as the presence of asbestos in some structures.  These environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or committed the acts or omissions that caused the presence of the hazardous substances.  The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly address contamination caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral, and could result in claims by and liabilities to third parties relating to contamination that emanated from our properties.  Although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of assessment and remediation, known environmental liabilities are not currently expected to have a material impact on our financial condition.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nOur executive officers are appointed by our Board of Directors and each of our executive officers has been employed by us for more than five years.

All of our filings with the SEC can be accessed free of charge through our website promptly after filing; however, in the event that the website is inaccessible, we will provide paper copies of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, the most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, current reports filed or furnished on Form 8-K, and all\n5\nrelated amendments, excluding exhibits, free of charge upon request.  These filings are also accessible on the SEC's website at\nwww.sec.gov\n.  The content of our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nGeneral Information\nOur registrar and stock transfer agent is Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, LLC (\"Broadridge\"), Edgewood, NY.  We offer a dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") that enables our shareholders to reinvest dividends automatically, as well as to make voluntary cash payments toward the purchase of additional shares.  For more information, contact Broadridge toll free at (877) 830-4936 or our Shareholder Relations Department at (904) 598-7000.\nThe Company's stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, with its common stock traded under the ticker symbol \"REG,\"  and the Company's 6.250% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, and 5.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock trade under the ticker symbols \"REGCP\", and \"REGCO\", respectively.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is\nKPMG LLP\n,\nJacksonville, Florida\n, Firm ID\n185\n.\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders\nOur 2024 annual meeting of shareholders is currently expected to be held on Wednesday, May 1, 2024, and will be conducted in a virtual-only format to the extent permitted by applicable law.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the required Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") presentations, we use and report certain non-GAAP measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results.  We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.  Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.  We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.\nWe do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders.  The principal limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management's judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP measures.  In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided.  Non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects of the Company.\nDefined Terms\nThe following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand, and evaluate our operational results, and are included in this document:\n•\nCore Operating Earnings\nis an additional performance measure we use because the computation of Nareit Funds from Operations (\"Nareit FFO\") includes certain non-comparable items that affect our period-over-period performance.  Core Operating Earnings excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses, (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt, (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from straight-line rents, above and below market rent amortization, and debt and derivative mark-to-market amortization, and (iv) other amounts as they occur.  We provide reconciliations of both Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders to Nareit FFO and Nareit FFO to Core Operating Earnings.\n•\nDevelopment Completion\nis a Property in Development that is deemed complete upon the earlier of: (i) 90% of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95%, or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations.  Once deemed complete, the property is termed a Retail Operating Property.\n•\nFixed Charge Coverage Ratio\nis defined as Operating EBITDA\nre\ndivided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders.\n•\nNareit EBITDAre\nis a measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax\n6\nexpense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) gains on sales of real estate, (v) impairments of real estate, and (vi) adjustments to reflect the Company's share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\n•\nNareit Funds from Operations (\"Nareit FFO\")\nis a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which Nareit defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sales and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We compute Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition.\nCompanies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions.  Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sale and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs.  This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations.  We provide a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders to Nareit FFO.\n•\nNet Operating Income (\"NOI\")\nis the sum of base rent, percentage rent, recoveries from tenants, other lease income, and other property income, less operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, ground rent, and uncollectible lease income.  NOI excludes straight-line rental income and expense, above and below market rent and ground rent amortization, tenant lease inducement amortization, and other fees.  We also provide disclosure of NOI excluding termination fees, which excludes both termination fee income and expenses.\n•\nA Non-Same Property\nis any property, during either calendar year period being compared, that was acquired, sold, a Property in Development, a Development Completion, or a property under, or being positioned for, significant redevelopment that distorts comparability between periods.  Non-retail properties and corporate activities, including the captive insurance program, are part of Non-Same Property.\n•\nOperating EBITDAre\nbegins with Nareit EBITDAre and excludes certain non-cash components of earnings derived from straight-line rents and above and below market rent amortization.  We provide a reconciliation of Net income to Nareit EBITDAre to Operating EBITDAre.\n•\nPro-rata\ninformation includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our economic share (based on our ownership interest) in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.\nWe provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, when read in conjunction with our reported results under GAAP.  We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of assets, liabilities, operating results, and other metrics, along with certain other non-GAAP measures, makes comparisons of our operating results to those of other REITs more meaningful.  The Pro-rata information provided is not, nor is it intended to be, presented in accordance with GAAP.  The Pro-rata supplemental details of assets and liabilities and supplemental details of operations reflect our proportionate economic ownership of the assets, liabilities, and operating results of the properties in our portfolio\nThe Pro-rata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the assets, liabilities, and operating results of properties in our portfolio.  We do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships, and the Pro-rata presentations of the assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items.  The partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements, which generally provide for such allocations according to their invested capital.  Our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our Pro-rata share.\nThe presentation of Pro-rata information has limitations which include, but are not limited to, the following:\no\nThe amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; and\no\nOther companies in our industry may calculate their Pro-rata interest differently, limiting the comparability of Pro-rata information.\nBecause of these limitations, the Pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP.  We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements, using the Pro-rata information as a supplement.\n•\nProperty In Development\nincludes properties in various stages of ground-up development.\n•\nProperty In Redevelopment\nincludes Retail Operating Properties under redevelopment or being positioned for redevelopment.  Unless otherwise indicated, a Property in Redevelopment is included in the Same Property pool.\n7\n•\nRedevelopment Completion\nis a Property in Redevelopment that is deemed complete upon the earlier of: (i) 90% of total estimated project costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95% for the Company owned GLA related to the project, or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations, if applicable.\n•\nRetail Operating Property\nis any retail property not termed a Property in Development.  A retail property is any property where the majority of the income is generated from retail uses.\n•\nSame Property\nis a Retail Operating Property that was owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar year periods being compared.  This term excludes Properties in Development, prior year Development Completions, and Non-Same Properties.  Properties in Redevelopment are included unless otherwise indicated.\n8"

    "text": "Our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those listed below.  When considering an investment in our securities, carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our other filings and submissions to the SEC, which provide much more information and detail.  If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition and/ or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to the Current Economic and Geopolitical Environments\nInterest rates in the current economic environment may adversely impact our cost to borrow, real estate valuation, and stock price.\nOn multiple occasions during 2022 and 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\"the U.S. Federal Reserve\") raised its benchmark federal funds rate, which has led to numerous increases in interest rates in the credit markets, with further increases possible.  Higher interest rates may negatively impact consumer spending, our tenants' businesses, and/or future demand for space in our shopping centers.\nAdditionally, higher interest rates adversely impact our cost of borrowing.  Our exposure to higher interest rates in the short term includes our variable-rate borrowings, which consist of borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and variable rate based secured notes payable.  Increases in interest rates could increase our financing costs over time, either through near-term borrowings on our floating-rate line of credit or refinancing of our existing borrowings that may incur higher interest expenses related to the issuance of new debt.  Prolonged periods of higher interest rates may negatively impact the valuation of our real estate asset portfolio and could result in a decline of our stock price and market capitalization, which may adversely impact our ability and willingness to raise equity capital on favorable terms through sales of our common shares, including through our At the Market (\"ATM\") program.\nAlthough the extent of any prolonged periods of higher interest rates remains unknown at this time, negative impacts to our cost of capital may also adversely affect our future business plans and growth, at least in the near term.\nCurrent economic challenges, including the potential for recession, may adversely impact our tenants and our business.\nThe success of our tenants in operating their businesses and their corresponding ability to pay us rent continue to be significantly impacted by many current economic challenges, which impact their cost of doing business, including, but not limited to, inflation, labor shortages, supply chain constraints, decreasing consumer confidence and discretionary spending, and increasing energy prices and interest rates.  Additionally, macroeconomic and geopolitical risks create challenges that may exacerbate current market conditions in the United States, including the potential for a recession.\nThese economic challenges could adversely impact our volume of leasing activity, which could include tenant move outs and/or higher levels of uncollectible lease income, as well as negatively affect the business and financial results of our tenants.  The aggregate impacts of these current economic challenges may also negatively affect the overall market for retail space, resulting in decreased demand for space in our centers.  This, in turn, could result in pricing pressure on rent that we are able to charge to new or renewing tenants, such that future rent spreads could be adversely impacted.  Further, we may experience higher costs for tenant buildouts, as costs of materials and labor may increase and supply and availability of both may become more limited.\nUnfavorable developments affecting the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition, and overall results of operations.\nActual events, concerns or speculation about disruption or instability in the banking and financial services industry, such as liquidity constraints or lack of available credit, the failure of individual institutions, or the inability of individual institutions or the banking and financial service industry generally to meet their contractual obligations, could significantly impair our access to capital, delay access to deposits or other financial assets, or cause actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements. Similarly, these events, concerns or speculation could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us and our tenants to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, our critical vendors and business partners also could be adversely affected by these risks as described above, which in turn could result in their committing a breach or default under their contractual agreements with us, their insolvency or bankruptcy, or other adverse effects.\nAny decline in available funding, lack of credit in the commercial real estate market, or access to cash and liquidity resources, or non-compliance of banking and financial services counterparties with their contractual commitments to us, our tenants or our critical vendors and business partners could, among other risks, have material adverse impacts on our ability to meet our operating expenses and other financial needs, could result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations, and could have material adverse impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n9\nCurrent geopolitical challenges could impact the U.S. economy and consumer spending and our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our business, and the businesses of our tenants, largely depends on consumer spending. While we currently own no shopping centers or other assets outside of the U.S. nor have meaningful direct international supply chain exposure, geopolitical challenges and their potential impact on the global macroeconomic environment, including the war involving Russia and Ukraine, Middle East conflicts and wars, and the economic and other possible conflicts involving China (including any slowing of its economy), could impact aspects of the U.S. economy and, therefore, consumer spending. In addition, these geopolitical challenges could impact other areas of the U.S. economy, which could impact our business and the businesses of our tenants through rising inflation and interest rates (and, hence, reduced availability and/or increased costs of borrowing), increased energy prices, labor shortages, supply chain constraints and, potentially, a U.S. economic recession.  It is unclear whether and when these geopolitical challenges and uncertainties will be mitigated or resolved, and what effects they may have on global political and economic conditions over the long term. However, a substantial delay in or lack of resolution of these challenges could have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and consumer spending and, therefore, an adverse effect on our results of operations and the financial condition of the Company.\nRisks Relating to Regency's Financial Performance Relating to the Urstadt Biddle Merger\nRegency may not realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from the Urstadt Biddle merger.\nOn August 18, 2023, Regency completed its merger with Urstadt Biddle.  The success of the merger will depend, in part, on Regency’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from successfully combining its and Urstadt Biddle’s businesses. Regency is devoting substantial management attention and resources to integrating its and Urstadt Biddle’s business practices and operations so that Regency can fully realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers. Nonetheless, the business and assets acquired may not be successful or continue to grow at the same rate as when operated independently or may require greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. The mergers could also result in the assumption of unknown or contingent liabilities. Potential difficulties Regency may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n•\nthe inability to successfully combine the businesses of Regency and Urstadt Biddle in a manner that permits Regency to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the mergers, which would result in some anticipated benefits of the mergers not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated, or at all;\n•\nthe failure to integrate operations and internal systems, programs and controls;\n•\nthe inability to successfully realize the anticipated value from some of Urstadt Biddle’s assets;\n•\nlost sales, loss of tenants and other commercial relationships;\n•\nthe complexities associated with managing the combined company;\n•\nthe complexities of combining two companies with different histories, cultures, markets, strategies and customer bases;\n•\nthe failure to retain key employees of either of the two companies that may be difficult to replace;\n•\nthe disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in services, standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n•\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the mergers; and\n•\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the mergers and integrating Regency’s and Urstadt Biddle’s operations.\nAs a result, the anticipated benefits of the mergers may not be realized fully within the expected time frame or at all or may take longer to realize or cost more than expected, which could adversely affect Regency’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRisk Factors Related to Pandemics or other Health Crises\nPandemics or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants' financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local governments mandated or recommended various actions to reduce or prevent the spread of COVID-19, which altered customer behaviors and temporarily limited many of our tenants’ ability to operate.  As a result, certain tenants requested rent concessions or sought to renegotiate future rents based on changes to the economic environment.  Some tenants chose not to reopen or to honor the terms of their lease agreements.  In addition, moratoria and other legal restrictions in certain states impacted our ability to bring legal action to enforce our leases and our ability to collect rent.  Should\n10\nfederal, state, and local governments mandate or recommend lockdowns again in the future due to a pandemic or other similar health crises, tenants could request rent concessions or seek to renegotiate future rents.\nIn the event of future pandemics or similar health crises, consumers could elect to make more of their purchases online instead of in physical stores and businesses could delay executing new or renewals of leases amidst the immediate and uncertain economic impacts.  These developments, coupled with potential tenant failures and a reduction in newly-formed businesses, could result in decreased demand for retail space in our centers, which could result in lower occupancy or higher levels of uncollectible lease income, as well as downward pressure on rents.  Additionally, delays in construction of tenant improvements due to the impacts of constraints on supply chains and labor, resulting from government ordered lockdowns, could result in delayed rent commencement due to it taking longer for new tenants to open and operate.\nAlthough the vast majority of our lease income is derived from contractual rent payments, the ability of certain of our tenants to meet their lease obligations could be negatively impacted by the disruptions and uncertainties of a new virus strain of COVID-19 or any future pandemic or other health crisis.  Our tenants' ability to respond to these disruptions and uncertainties, including adjusting to governmental orders and changes in their customers' shopping habits and behaviors, may impact their ability to survive, and ultimately, their ability to comply with their lease obligations.  Our future results of operations and overall financial performance could be uncertain should a new virus strain of COVID-19, or any future pandemic or other health crises occur.\nRisk Factors Related to Operating Retail-Based Shopping Centers\nEconomic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow, and increase our operating expenses.\nOur properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of base rent, expense recoveries and other income.  Therefore, our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry.  We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration, leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants, vacant space is not leased to new tenants, and/or tenants demand modified lease terms, including costs for renovations or concessions.  The economic and market conditions potentially affecting the retail industry and our properties specifically include the following:\n•\nchanges in national, regional and local economic conditions;\n•\nchanges in population and migration patterns to/from the markets in which we operate;\n•\ndeterioration in the competitiveness and creditworthiness of our retail tenants;\n•\nincreased competition from the use of e-commerce by retailers and consumers as well as other concepts that could impact more traditional retail;\n•\nlabor challenges and supply delays and shortages due to a variety of macroeconomic factors, including disruptions to global supply chains as a result of wars involving Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Gaza, the slowing of China's economy, pandemics, and/or inflationary pressures;\n•\ntenant bankruptcies and subsequent rejections of our leases;\n•\nreductions in consumer spending and retail sales, including inflationary impacts on consumer behavior;\n•\nreduced tenant demand for retail space;\n•\noversupply of retail space;\n•\nreduced consumer demand for certain retail categories;\n•\nconsolidation within the retail sector;\n•\nincreased operating costs attendant to owning and operating retail shopping centers;\n•\nperceptions by retailers and shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties; and\n•\nother factors which could alter shopping habits or otherwise deter customers from visiting our shopping centers, such as criminal activity, including civil unrest, acts of terrorism, or other types of violent crimes.\nTo the extent that any or a combination of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact the retail industry, our retail tenants, the emergence of new tenants, the demand for retail space, market rents and rent growth, capital expenditures, the percent leased levels of our properties, the value of our properties, our ability to sell, acquire or develop properties, our operating results and our cash flows.\n11\nShifts in retail trends, sales, and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRetailers are increasingly impacted by e-commerce and changes in customer buying habits, including shopping from home and the delivery or curbside pick-up of items ordered online.  Retailers are considering these customer buying habits and other trends when making decisions regarding their brick and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing retail environment.  Many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods which have historically been less likely to be purchased online; however, the continuing change in customer buying habits, including increase in e-commerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of their retail locations in the future or close stores.  For example, our grocer tenants are incorporating e-commerce concepts through home delivery and curbside pick-up, which could reduce foot traffic at our centers.  These alternative delivery methods are more likely to impact foot traffic at our centers in certain higher-income markets where consumers are willing to pay premiums for such services.  Changes in customer buying habits and shopping trends may also impact the profitability and financial condition of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions, and therefore may impact their ability to pay rent.  This shift may adversely impact our percent leased and rental rates, which would impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nChanging economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow.\nEconomic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance.   Our properties in California and Florida represent 23.4% and 19.3%, respectively, of our annualized base rent.  Our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions, such as supply of or demand for retail space, deteriorate more significantly in these states compared to other geographic areas.  Additionally, there is a risk that businesses and residents in major metropolitan cities may relocate to different states or suburban markets.\nOur success depends on the continued presence and success of our \"anchor\" tenants.\n\"Anchor Tenants\" (tenants occupying 10,000 square feet or more) operate large stores in our shopping centers, pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the attraction and success of other tenants by drawing shoppers to the property.  Our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and incurrence of additional costs in the event a significant Anchor Tenant:\n•\nbecomes bankrupt or insolvent;\n•\nexperiences a downturn in its business;\n•\nshifts its capital allocation away from brick and mortar formats;\n•\nmaterially defaults on its leases;\n•\ndoes not renew its leases as they expire;\n•\nrenews at lower rental rates and/or requires a tenant improvement allowance; or\n•\nrenews but reduces its store size, which results in down-time and additional tenant improvement costs to the landlord to re-lease the vacated space.\nSome anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from re-tenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement.  Vacated \"Anchor Space\" (spaces 10,000 square feet or more), including space that may be owned by the anchor (as discussed below), can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchor's customer drawing power.  In addition, if a significant tenant vacates a property, so-called \"co-tenancy clauses\" in select leases may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent payment or other lease obligations.  Co-tenancy clauses have several variants: they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores; they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration; or more commonly, they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center.\nAdditionally, some of our shopping centers are anchored by retailers who own their space in a location that is within or immediately adjacent to our shopping center (\"shadow anchors\").  In those cases, the shadow anchors appear to the consumer as a retail tenant of the shopping center and, as a result, attract additional consumer traffic to the center.  In the event that a shadow Anchor Space becomes vacant, it could negatively impact our center as consumer traffic would likely be reduced.\nA percentage of our revenues are derived from \"local\" tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if these tenants are not successful, or if the demand for the types or mix of tenants significantly change.\nAt December 31, 2023, tenants with less than three locations (\"Local Tenants\") represent approximately 22% of annualized base rent.  Local Tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers.  These Local Tenants may be more vulnerable to negative\n12\neconomic conditions and changing customer buying habits and retail trends as they may have more limited resources and access to capital than other tenants.  As such, in the event of such changing conditions, habits and trends, they may suffer disproportionately greater impacts and be at greater risk of lease default than other tenants.\nWe may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy.\nAlthough lease income is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file for bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores.  Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims.  As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold.  Additionally, we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to re-lease the vacated space. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files for bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant.\nMany of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase, even if our lease income decreases.\nCertain costs and expenses associated with our operating our properties, such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and common area expenses, generally do not decrease in the event of reduced occupancy or rental rates, non-payment of rents by tenants, general economic downturns, pandemics or other similar circumstances.  In fact, in some cases, such as real estate taxes and insurance, they may actually increase despite such events.  As such, we may not be able to lower the operating expenses of our properties sufficiently to fully offset such circumstances and may not be able to fully recoup these costs from our tenants.  In such cases, our cash flows, operating results and financial performance may be adversely impacted.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other building, fire, and safety regulations may have a material negative effect on us.\nAll of our properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities.  Compliance with ADA requirements may require removal of access barriers, and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both.  While the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected.  In addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations and building codes as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties.  Costs to be in compliance with the ADA or any other building, fire, and safety regulations could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.\nRisk Factors Related to Real Estate Investments\nOur real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income.\nOur real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable which may result in impairment.  We evaluate whether there are any indicators, including declines in property operating performance and general market conditions, such that the value of the real estate properties (including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities, including goodwill) may not be recoverable and therefore may be impaired.  Our evaluation includes several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated holding periods, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results.  Changes in our investment, redevelopment, and disposition strategies or changes in the market where an asset is located may alter management's intended holding period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to our financial condition or operating performance.\nThe fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  Such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other relevant criteria, and therefore are subject to management judgment.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.\nThese subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income, which may be material.  There can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets.\n13\nWe face risks associated with development, redevelopment, and expansion of properties.\nWe actively pursue opportunities for new retail development and existing property redevelopment and/or expansion.  Development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements, and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay development and redevelopment projects.  We may not recover our investment in our projects for which approvals are not received, and delays may adversely impact our expected returns.  Additionally, changes in political elections and policies may impact our ability to obtain favorable land use and zoning for in-process and future developments and redevelopment projects.  We are subject to other risks associated with these activities, including the following:\n•\nwe may be unable to lease developments or redevelopments to full occupancy on a timely basis;\n•\nthe occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable, or otherwise not meet our investment return expectations;\n•\nactual costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project unprofitable, or not meet our investment return expectations;\n•\ndelays in the development or construction process may increase our costs;\n•\nconstruction cost increases may reduce investment returns on development and redevelopment opportunities;\n•\nwe may abandon development or redevelopment opportunities and lose our investment due to adverse market conditions;\n•\nthe size of our development and redevelopment pipeline may strain our labor or capital capacity to complete the development and redevelopment projects within targeted timelines and may reduce our investment returns;\n•\na reduction in the demand for new retail space may reduce our future development and redevelopment activities, which in turn may reduce our NOI; and\n•\nchanges in the level of future development and redevelopment activity may adversely impact our results of operations by reducing the amount of internal overhead costs that may be capitalized.\nWe face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.\nIf we engage in more complex acquisitions and mixed-use development and redevelopment projects, there could be more unique risks to our return on investment.  Mixed-use projects refer to real estate projects that, in addition to retail space, may also include space for residential, office, hotel or other commercial purposes.  We have less experience in developing and managing non-retail real estate than we do retail real estate.  As a result, if a development or redevelopment project includes a non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer, or partner with a developer.\n•\nIf we decide to develop the non-retail components ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate, but also to risks associated with developing, owning, operating or selling non-retail real estate, including but not limited to more complex entitlement processes and multiple-story buildings. These unique risks may adversely impact our return on investment in these mixed-use development projects.\n•\nIf we sell the non-retail components, our retail component will be impacted by the decisions made by the other owners, and actions of those occupying the non-retail spaces in these mixed-use properties.\n•\nIf we partner with a developer, it makes us dependent upon the partner's ability to perform and to agree on major decisions that impact our investment returns of the project.  In addition, there is a risk that the non-retail developer may default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other components ourselves, including providing necessary financing.\nWe face risks associated with the acquisition of properties.\nOur investment strategy includes investing in high-quality shopping centers that are leased to market-leading grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers, and/or restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities.  The acquisition of properties and/or real estate entities entails risks that include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows:\n•\nproperties we acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we estimate, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve expected investment returns;\n•\nour investigation of an entity, property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representation we may have received from such seller, may fail to reveal various liabilities including defects, necessary repairs or environmental matters requiring corrective action, which may increase our costs;\n•\nour estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short, either of which may result in the property failing to achieve our projected return, either temporarily or permanently;\n•\nwe may not recover our costs from an unsuccessful acquisition;\n14\n•\nour acquisition activities may distract or strain our management capacity; and\n•\nwe may not be able to successfully integrate an acquisition into our existing operations platform.\nWe may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions.\nOur properties, including their related tangible and intangible assets, represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they may not be readily convertible to cash.  Market conditions, including macroeconomic events, pandemics and other health crises, may impact our ability to sell properties on our preferred timing and at prices and returns we deem acceptable.  As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties, including properties held in joint ventures, in response to changes in economic, industry, financial market, or other conditions may be limited.  The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability and terms of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand for space, that are beyond our control.  There may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments, and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing.  If we want to sell a property, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment.\nChanges in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate.\nCertain properties we own have a low tax basis, which may result in a meaningful taxable gain on sale.  We utilize, and intend to continue to utilize, Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 like-kind exchanges to tax-efficiently buy and sell properties; however, there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions or that changes to the tax laws do not eliminate the benefits of effectuating 1031 exchanges, or significantly change the requirements for a transaction to qualify for 1031 exchange treatment.  In the event that we cannot or do not utilize 1031 exchanges, we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax, which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments or other priorities.\nRisk Factors Related to the Environment Affecting Our Properties\nClimate change may adversely impact our properties directly and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees.\nWhile we work with experts to plan for the impacts of climate change on our business, we cannot reliably predict the extent, rate, timing, or impact of climate change.  To the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns, our properties in certain markets, especially those nearer to the coasts, may experience increases in storm frequency and intensity and rising sea‑levels.  Further, population migration may occur in response to these or other factors and negatively impact our centers. For example, climate and other environmental changes may result in more unpredictable or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties, reduced rent or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate certain properties at all.  Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance or making insurance unavailable.  While the federal government has not yet enacted comprehensive legislation to address climate change that would directly impact us, certain states in which we own and operate shopping centers, including California and New York, have done so.  Compliance with these and future new laws or regulations related to climate change may require us to make additional investments in or for our existing properties, resulting in increased capital expenditures and operating costs, implement new or additional processes and controls to facilitate compliance, and/or pay additional energy, insurance, taxes and related fees and costs.  At this time, there can be no assurance that we can anticipate all potential material impacts of climate change, or that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on the value of our properties and our financial performance in the future.\nGeographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change.\nA significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, sea-level rise, and other natural disasters.  At December 31, 2023, 18.7% of the GLA of our portfolio is located in the state of California, including a number of properties in the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas.  Additionally, 20.1% and 7.1% of the GLA of our portfolio is located in the states of Florida and Texas, respectively.  Insurance costs for properties in these areas have increased significantly, and recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future.  We recognize that the frequency and / or intensity of extreme weather events, and other climatic changes may continue to increase, and as a result, our exposure to these events may increase.  These weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants, which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas.  Therefore, as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, we face risks, including disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants and higher costs, such as uninsured property losses, higher insurance premiums, and potential additional regulatory requirements by government agencies in response to perceived risks.\n15\nCosts of environmental remediation may adversely impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow.\nUnder various federal, state, and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for some or all the costs to assess and remediate the presence of hazardous substances on the property, which in our case most typically arise from current or former dry cleaners, gas stations, asbestos usage, and historic land use practices.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances, which may adversely impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow.  The presence of, or the failure to properly address the presence of, hazardous substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral.  We can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities or their ultimate cost to address; that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties; and that future uses or conditions, or changes in environmental laws and regulations, or their interpretation, will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us.\nRisk Factors Related to Corporate Matters\nAn increased focus on metrics and reporting related to environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") factors, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nInvestors have become more focused on understanding how companies address a variety of ESG factors.  As they evaluate investment decisions, many investors look not only at company disclosures but also to ESG rating systems that have been developed by third parties to allow ESG comparisons between companies.  Although we participate in a number of these ratings systems, we do not participate in all such systems, and may not score as well in all of the available ratings systems as other REITs and real estate operators.  Further, the criteria used in these ratings systems may conflict with each other and change frequently, and we cannot guaranty that we will be able to score well in the future.  We supplement our participation in ratings systems by disclosing on our website information about our ESG activities, but some investors may desire additional disclosures that we do not provide.  In addition, the SEC is currently considering adopting new regulations that would impose additional ESG disclosure and other compliance requirements on us.  California has adopted a number of climate disclosure laws which will increase our compliance costs and require us to make additional climate disclosures.  Other states are considering legislation similar to California’s new laws.  Failure to participate in certain of the third-party ratings systems, failure to score well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain ESG disclosures could adversely impact us when investors compare us against similar companies in our industry, and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our stock, which could adversely impact our stock price and our ability to raise capital.  In addition, failure to comply with new government climate and other ESG disclosure obligations could subject us to significant fines and penalties.\nAn uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties.\nWe carry liability, fire, flood, terrorism, business interruption, and environmental insurance for our properties.  Some types of losses, such as losses from named windstorms, earthquakes, terrorism, or wars may have more limited coverage, or in some cases, can be excluded from insurance coverage.  In addition, it is possible that the availability of insurance coverage in certain areas may decrease in the future, and the cost to procure such insurance may increase due to factors beyond our control.  As a result, we may reduce the insurance we procure or we may elect or be compelled to self-insure or otherwise assume some of this risk.  Should a loss occur at any of our properties that is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies, we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property, which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.\nTerrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss.  Insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.  To the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of violence, their businesses may be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe success of our business depends, in significant part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and other key personnel, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented and diverse employees may significantly impact our future performance.  Competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot be assured that we will retain all of our executive management team and other key personnel or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future.  Losing any key personnel may have an adverse effect on us.\n16\nRisk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint Ventures\nWe do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our real estate partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.\nWe have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire, own, lease, develop or redevelop properties.  These activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our wholly-owned properties.  However, these investments, and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt, suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions.  Partners or other owners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.\nThese investments, and other future similar investments, also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as a sale or financing, because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture.  Disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in a premature termination of the applicable partnership or joint venture, or potentially litigation or arbitration, that may increase our investment and related risk as well as our costs and expenses associated with the investment, and distract management from sufficiently focusing their time and efforts on others areas of our business.  In addition, we risk the possibility of being held liable for the actions of our partners or other owners.  These factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates.\nThe termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.\nIf partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we could lose the asset, property management, leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships as well as the operating income of the properties, which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders.  Certain of our partnership operating agreements provide either member the ability to elect buy/sell clauses.  The election of these dissolution provisions could require us to invest additional capital to acquire the partners’ interest or to sell our share of the property thereby losing the operating income and cash flow.\nRisk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital Structure\nOur ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings.\nAs part of our funding strategy, we sell properties that no longer meet our strategic objectives or investment standards and/or those with a limited future growth profile.  These sales proceeds are used to fund debt repayment, acquisition of other properties, and new developments and redevelopments.  An increase in market capitalization rates (which may or may not be driven by an increase in interest rates) or a decline in NOI may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated.  Additionally, the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our REIT status.\nWe depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nTo qualify as a REIT, the Parent Company must, among other things, distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (excluding any net capital gains).  Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations.  In such instances, we would rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings.  Our access to debt depends on our credit rating, the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets.  In addition to finding lenders willing to lend to us, we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance.\nIn addition, our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing.  Additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders' interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage.\nWithout access to external sources of capital, we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales.  Our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate.  If we are required to deleverage our business\n17\nwith operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales, we may be forced to reduce the amount of, or eliminate altogether, our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business.\nOur debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.  In addition, we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due.  If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced (i) to dispose of properties, which might result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders.  If we cannot make required mortgage loan payments, the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage.\nCovenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur unsecured notes and unsecured line of credit (the \"Line\") contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratio of indebtedness to total asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio.  These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our investment activities.  Moreover, if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period, our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately, even in the absence of a payment default.  Many of our debt arrangements, including our unsecured notes and the Line, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations.  As a result, any default under our debt covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations, and the market value of our stock.\nIncreases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.\nAlthough a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facility, and certain secured borrowings.  As of December 31, 2023, less than 1.0% of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt not hedged to fixed rate debt.  Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates.  In addition, increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures, to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates.  This would reduce our future earnings and cash flows, which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders.\nHedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us.\nWe manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements.  These arrangements involve risk, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes.  There can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations.  Should we desire to terminate a hedging arrangement, there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging arrangement.  In addition, failure to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisk Factors Related to Information Management and Technology\nThe unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data, or of Regency's proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liabilities and adverse financial impact.\nMany of our information technology systems (including the systems of our real estate partners and other third-party business partners and service providers, whether cloud-based or hosted in our servers) contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our tenants and employees.  Many of our information technology systems contain our proprietary information and other confidential information related to our business.\nWe are subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems.  To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of tenants' or employees' data or our confidential information stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks such as ransomware, denial of service or other methods, such a breach may damage our reputation and cause us to lose tenants and employees, result in adverse financial impact, incur third party claims and cause disruption to our business and plans.  Despite planning, preparation, and preventative measures, such attacks may be successful in the future and our business may be significantly\n18\ndisrupted if unable to quickly recover.  Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. privacy and other laws, and potentially subject us to litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability, and we may not be able to recover these expenses from our service providers, responsible parties, or insurance carriers.  Despite the ongoing significant investments in technology and training we make relating to cybersecurity, we can provide no assurance that we will avoid or prevent such breaches or attacks.\nIn addition, despite the implementation of security measures for our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, our information systems may be vulnerable to damage or other adverse impact from multiple sources other than cybersecurity risks, including computer viruses, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failure.  Any system failure or accident that causes disruption or interruptions to our information systems could result in a material disruption to our operations and business, and cause us to incur material costs to remedy such damages or adverse impacts.\nThe use of technology based on artificial intelligence presents risks relating to confidentiality, creation of inaccurate and flawed outputs and emerging regulatory risk, any or all of which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs with many technological innovations, artificial intelligence (“AI\") presents great promise but also risks and challenges that could adversely affect our business. Sensitive, proprietary, or confidential information of the Company, our tenants and employees, could be leaked, disclosed, or revealed as a result of or in connection with the use of generative AI technologies by our employees or vendors. Any such information input into a third-party generative AI or machine learning platform could be revealed to others, including if information is used to train the third party's generative AI or machine learning models. Additionally, where a generative AI or machine learning model ingests personal information and makes connections using such data, those technologies may reveal other sensitive, proprietary, or confidential information generated by the model. Moreover, generative AI or machine learning models may create incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise flawed outputs, some of which may appear correct. Due to these issues, these models could lead us to make flawed decisions that could result in adverse consequences to us, including exposure to reputational and competitive harm, customer loss, and legal liability.  In addition, uncertainty in the legal regulatory regime relating to AI may require significant resources to modify and maintain business practices to comply with applicable law, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time. Several jurisdictions have already proposed or enacted laws governing AI. For example, on October 30, 2023, the Biden administration issued an Executive Order to, among other things, establish extensive new standards for AI safety and security. Other jurisdictions may decide to adopt similar or more restrictive legislation that may render the use of such technologies challenging. These obligations may prevent or limit our ability to use AI in our business, lead to regulatory fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices. If we cannot use AI, or that use is restricted, our business may be less efficient, or we may be at a competitive disadvantage. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Related to the Market Price for Our Securities\nChanges in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nThe market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, many of which are out of our control, including:\n•\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n•\nchanges in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;\n•\npublication of research reports about us or the real estate industry in general and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;\n•\nincreases in market interest rates that drive investors in, or potential purchasers of, our stock to seek other investments or demand a higher dividend yield;\n•\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n•\nadverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;\n•\nany future issuances of equity securities;\n•\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n•\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n•\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n•\nreports by corporate governance rating companies;\n•\nincreased investor focus on sustainability-related risks, including climate change;\n•\nchanges in our dividend payments;\n•\npotential tax law changes relating to REITs;\n•\nspeculation in the press or investment community; and\n•\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\n19\nThese factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.  It is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities, including our common stock, will not fall in the future.  A decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity capital in the public markets.  Selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at current or historical rates.\nOur ability to continue to pay dividends at current or historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:\n•\nour financial condition and results of future operations;\n•\nthe terms of our loan covenants; and\n•\nour ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.\nIf we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities.\nRisk Factors Related to Taxes and the Parent the Company's Qualification as a REIT\nIf the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.\nWe believe that the Parent Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that the Parent Company can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT.  If the Parent Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders.  Many REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex.  The determination that the Parent Company is a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation.  For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, like rent, that are itemized in the REIT tax laws.  There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the REIT requirements.  The Parent Company is also required to distribute to the stockholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains.  The Parent Company will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on undistributed taxable income and net capital gains and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions the Parent Company pays with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.  The fact that we hold many of our assets through real estate partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements.  Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult for the Parent Company to remain qualified as a REIT.\nAlso, unless the IRS granted relief under certain statutory provisions, the Parent Company would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year it first failed to qualify.  If the Parent Company failed to qualify as a REIT (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), the Parent Company would have to pay significant income taxes, reducing cash available to pay dividends, which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities.  In addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders in order to maintain our REIT status.  Although we believe that the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT, we cannot be assured that the Parent Company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.\nEven if the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Parent Company is required to pay certain federal, state, and local taxes on its income and property.  For example, if we have net income from \"prohibited transactions,\" that income will be subject to a 100% tax.  In general, prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.  The determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale.  While we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend otherwise.\nNew legislation, as well as new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may be introduced, enacted, or promulgated from time to time, that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders.\nDividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.\nSubject to limited exceptions, dividends paid by REITs (other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends, qualified dividends or returns of capital) are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by \"C\" corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates.  Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJA\"), however, domestic shareholders that are individuals, trusts, and estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (e.g., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 3, 2017, and before\n20\nJanuary 1, 2026.  Although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which may adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the per share trading price of the Parent Company's capital stock.\nCertain foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a \"domestically controlled\" REIT.\nA foreign person, other than a \"qualified shareholder\" or a \"qualified foreign pension fund,\" as each is defined for purposes of the Code, disposing of a U.S. real property interest, including shares of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist principally of U.S. real property interests is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain recognized on the disposition.  This tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the REIT is \"domestically controlled.\"  In general, the Parent Company will be a domestically controlled REIT if, at all times during the five-year period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock, less than 50% in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons.  If the Parent Company were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT, gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock.\nWe seek to act in the best interests of the Parent Company as a whole and do not take into consideration the particular tax consequences to any specific holder of our stock.  Foreign persons should inform themselves as to the U.S. tax consequences, and the tax consequences within the countries of their citizenship, residence, domicile, and place of business, with respect to the purchase, ownership, and disposition of shares of our common stock.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs may have a negative effect on us or our investors.\nThe rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, may adversely affect the Parent Company or our investors.  We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect the Parent Company or our investors.  New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us.  There is also a risk that REIT status may be adversely impacted by a change in tax or other laws.  Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, may change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities.  Generally, income from a hedging transaction does not constitute \"gross income\" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the Code and Treasury Regulations.  To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, or fail to make the proper tax identifications, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests.  As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS.\nPartnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect.\nUnder current federal partnership tax audit rules, subject to certain exceptions, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and a partner’s allocable share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, and penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected, at the partnership level. With respect to any partnership in which we invest, unless such partnership makes an election or takes certain steps to require the partners to pay their tax on their allocable shares of the adjustment, it is possible that such partnership would be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment. We could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even though we may not otherwise have been required to pay additional taxes had we owned the assets of the partnership directly.\nRisk Factors Related to the Company's Common Stock\nRestrictions on the ownership of the Parent Company's capital stock to preserve its REIT status may delay or prevent a change in control.\nOwnership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited, with certain exceptions, by the Parent Company's articles of incorporation, for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a REIT.  This 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7% of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control.\n21\nThe issuance of the Parent Company's capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control.\nThe Parent Company's articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock (less the shares of preferred stock already issued and outstanding) and 10,000,000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued.  The issuance of preferred stock or special common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.  The provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act regarding affiliated transactions may also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders.\nOwnership in the Parent Company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or other corporate purposes, including equity awards we will grant to our directors, officers and employees.  In the past we have issued equity in the secondary market and may do so again in the future, depending on the price of our stock and other factors.\nIn addition, our restated articles of incorporation, as amended, authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, limitations, and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine.  The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.  For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions.  Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock."

    "text": "Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nThe Company employs a tiered structure of management and oversight for cybersecurity, characterized by distinct layers of responsibility and decision making, which includes operation staff, management, and senior management and board-level governance. As discussed in more detail below under “Cybersecurity Governance”, this involves management responsibility through a specialized Cyber Risk Committee (the “CRC”) and oversight of that committee by a group of the most senior leaders of the Company, which comprise the Company’s Executive Committee.  At the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) level, the Audit Committee oversees our cybersecurity risk management program.\nOur strategy for managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into the Company’s overall risk management program and structure, as depicted in the Corporate Governance section of our Proxy under “Risk Oversight”.\nThe Company, through its Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), other Company employees experienced in information network security, and the use of third-party expertise, references various recognized cybersecurity frameworks. These frameworks are used to benchmark and tailor the Company’s cybersecurity strategies and program to our risk profile and specific operational needs and goals. Our core cybersecurity strategy focuses on five key pillars: identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery, each tailored to meet the specific challenges and needs of our business. The primary goal of this strategy is to proactively safeguard the confidentiality, security, and availability of the information we collect and store. This proactive approach includes identifying, preventing, and mitigating cybersecurity threats, as well as preparing to respond to cybersecurity incidents quickly and efficiently to minimize their impact. Under the leadership of our CISO and CRC, we are committed to a continuous evaluation and enhancement of our cybersecurity practices to facilitate adaptation to the constantly evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.\nWe have adopted a risk-based strategy to manage cybersecurity risks associated with third parties. We prioritize our cybersecurity efforts relating to third parties based on the likelihood and potential impact of cybersecurity threats. This includes reviewing the security protocols of key vendors, service providers, and external users of our systems.\nThe CRC engages third-party expertise from time to time as it deems necessary or appropriate to test our cybersecurity defenses, to evaluate the cybersecurity programs of current and potential vendors and service providers, and to seek specialized legal advice regarding cybersecurity.\nSince at least January 1, 2021, we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected the Company. Based on our current understanding of the cyber risk environment and our preparedness level, we do not believe it to be reasonably likely in the near term that a cybersecurity threat will materially impact our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\n22\nCybersecurity Governance\nThe Audit Committee of the Board is charged with overseeing our cybersecurity risk management program. The CRC Chair and the CISO provide the Audit Committee with quarterly updates. These updates cover the overall status of the Company’s cybersecurity program, as well as developments and potential new risks and trends. In the event of a significant cybersecurity threat or incident,  the CRC would escalate communication frequency and intensity with the Audit Committee, Board, and the Company’s Executive Committee (discussed below).\nAs designated by the Company’s Executive Committee and the Audit Committee, our CRC leads Regency's cybersecurity risk management program. This includes risk identification, assessment, management, prevention and mitigation, as well as securing necessary resources and reporting on cybersecurity preparedness to the Executive Committee (which is currently comprised of the CEO, CFO, and several of the Company’s other senior leaders) and the Audit Committee.\nCRC membership, which is subject to change from time to time, includes management leadership possessing a diverse range of education, experience and expertise, and is currently comprised of Company’s CISO, chief accounting officer, head of internal audit, general counsel and chief compliance officer, head of litigation, head of human resources, head of IT operations and the manager of network security.  The collective experience of this committee encompasses areas such as IT, network security, change and incident management, public company governance, accounting, financial controls, insurance, risk management, communications, human capital, and legal matters including securities, privacy and technology contracting.\n23"

Leases greater than 10,000 square feet (\"Anchor Leases\") generally have initial lease terms in excess of five years and are mostly comprised of Anchor Tenants.  Many of the leases contain provisions allowing the tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration.  Our leases typically provide for the payment of fixed base rent, the tenant’s Pro-rata share of real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance (\"CAM\") expenses, and reimbursement for utility costs if not directly metered.\n26\nThe following table summarizes Pro-rata lease expirations for the next ten years and thereafter, for our consolidated and unconsolidated properties, assuming no tenants renew their leases (GLA and dollars of In Place Annual Base Rent Expiring Under Leases in thousands):\n(1)\nLeases currently under month-to-month rent or in process of renewal.\nDuring 2024, we have a total of 1,081 leases expiring, representing 3.9 million square feet of GLA.  These expiring leases have an average base rent of $23.74 PSF.  The average base rent of new leases signed during 2023 was $29.89 PSF.  During periods of economic weakness or when percent leased is low, tenants have more bargaining power, which may result in rental rate declines on new or renewal leases.  In periods of recovery and/or when percent leased levels are high, landlords have more bargaining power, which generally results in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases.\nDemand for retail space in high quality, community centers located in areas with compelling demographics remains strong, especially among successful business operators and growing innovative business concepts.   However, inflationary challenges and the potential for an economic recession could result in pressure on base rent growth for new and renewal leases as businesses seek to manage costs.\n27\nThe following table lists information about our consolidated and unconsolidated properties.

Future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon cash generated by our operating results, our financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, future business prospects, annual dividend requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant.  In order to maintain Regency Centers Corporation's qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are generally required to make annual distributions equal to at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year.  Under certain circumstances we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements.   We have a dividend reinvestment plan under which our shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividends automatically in common stock.  Under the plan, we may elect to purchase common stock in the open market on behalf of shareholders or may issue new common stock to such shareholders.\nUnder the revolving credit agreement of our Line, in the event of any monetary default, we may not make distributions to shareholders except to the extent necessary to maintain our REIT status.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Operating Partnership issued 181,885 exchangeable operating partnership units to partially fund the acquisition of an operating property. Such units were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such issuances.\nThe following table represents information with respect to purchases by Regency of its common stock by months during the three month period ended December 31, 2023:\n(1)\nRepresents shares repurchased to cover payment of withholding taxes in connection with restricted stock vesting by participants under Regency's Long-Term Omnibus Plan.\n(2)\nOur Board has authorized a two-year common stock repurchase program under which we may purchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of $250 million of our outstanding common stock through open market purchases, and/or in privately negotiated transactions.  The timing and price of stock repurchases will be dependent upon market conditions and other factors.  Any stock repurchased, if not retired, will be treated as treasury stock.  Our stock repurchase program will expire February 7, 2025, unless modified, extended or earlier terminated by the Board.\n41\nThe performance graph furnished below shows Regency's cumulative total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 Index, the FTSE Nareit Equity REIT Index, and the FTSE Nareit Equity Shopping Centers index since December 31, 2018.

    "text": "Executing on our Strategy\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we had Net income attributable to common shareholders of $359.5 million as compared to $482.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, which included gains on sale of real estate of $109.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023:\n•\nWe completed the acquisition of UBP in an all-stock transaction.  As part of the transaction, we acquired over 70 properties, growing our portfolio of high-quality, neighborhood and community shopping centers in premier suburban trade areas that benefit from compelling demographics.\n•\nOur Pro-rata same property NOI, excluding termination fees, grew 1.7%, primarily attributable to improvements in base rent from increases in year over year occupancy rates, contractual rent steps in existing leases, and positive rent spreads on new and renewal leases.\n•\nWe executed 1,839 new and renewal leasing transactions representing 6.9 million Pro-rata SF with positive rent spreads of 10.0% during 2023, compared to 1,981 leasing transactions representing 7.3 million Pro-rata SF with positive rent spreads of 7.4% in 2022.  Rent spreads are calculated on all executed leasing transactions for comparable Retail Operating Property spaces, including spaces vacant greater than 12 months.\n•\nAt December 31, 2023, our total property portfolio was 95.1% leased while our same property portfolio was 95.7% leased, compared to 94.8% and 95.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2022.\nWe continued our development and redevelopment of high quality shopping centers:\n•\nEstimated Pro-rata project costs of our current in process development and redevelopment projects totaled $468.1 million compared to $300.9 million at December 31, 2022.\n•\nDevelopment and redevelopment projects completed during 2023 represented $87.4 million of estimated net project costs, with an average stabilized yield of 8.7%.\nWe maintained liquidity and financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities:\n•\nAt December 31, 2023, our Pro-rata net debt-to-operating EBITDA\nre\nratio on a trailing 12 month basis was 5.4x compared to 5.0x at December 31, 2022.\n•\nOn January 8, 2024, Regency priced a public offering of $400 million of senior unsecured debt due in 2034, with a coupon of 5.250% . The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to reduce the outstanding balance on its line of credit and for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the future repayment of outstanding debt. Prior to using any of the net proceeds, we may invest the net proceeds in certificates of deposit, interest-bearing short-term investment grade securities or money-market accounts.\n•\nWe have $250 million of unsecured debt maturing in June 2024, which we intend to pay off by utilizing the proceeds available from the January 2024 offering noted above.\n•\nWe have $148.3 million of secured mortgage maturities during the next 12 months, including mortgages within our real estate partnership, which we intend to refinance or pay-off as they mature.\n•\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $1.1 billion available on the Line. In January 2024, we amended the Line agreement, to, among other items, increase the borrowing capacity to $1.5 billion and to extend the maturity date to March 23, 2028 with the option to extend the maturity for two additional six-month periods.\n43\nUBP Acquisition\nOn August 18, 2023, we completed the acquisition of  UBP, which was structured as multiple mergers.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Urstadt Biddle common stock and Urstadt Biddle Class A common stock was converted into 0.347 of a share of common stock of the Parent Company.  Additionally, each share of UBP’s 6.25% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 5.875% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock was converted into one share of Parent Company Series A preferred stock and Parent Company Series B preferred stock, respectively.\nThe following table provides the components that make up the total purchase price for the UBP acquisition:\nAs part of the acquisition, Regency acquired 74 properties (all categorized as Non-Same Property for 2023 and 2024 reporting purposes) representing 5.3 million square feet of GLA, including 10 properties held through real estate partnerships.  The consolidated results of operations of UBP are included in the consolidated financial statements from the closing date, August 18, 2023 through December 31, 2023.\nLeasing Activity and Significant Tenants\nWe believe our high-quality, neighborhood and community shopping centers located in suburban trade areas with compelling demographics create attractive spaces for retail and service providers to operate their businesses.\nPro-rata Percent Leased\nThe following table summarizes Pro-rata percent leased of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio:\nOur percent leased increased primarily due to favorable leasing activity in our Shop Space category during 2023.\nPro-rata Leasing Activity\nThe following table summarizes leasing activity, including our Pro-rata share of activity within the portfolio of our real estate partnerships (totals as a weighted-average PSF):\n44\nThe weighted-average base rent PSF on signed Shop Space leases during 2023 was $37.82 PSF, which is higher than the weighted average annual base rent PSF of all Shop Space leases due to expire during the next 12 months of $34.73 PSF.  New and renewal rent spreads, as compared to prior rents on these same spaces leased, were positive at 10.0% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 7.4% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022.\nSignificant Tenants and Concentrations of Risk\nWe seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification of our properties, as seen in \"Item 2.\nProperties\n\" of this Report.  We seek to avoid dependence on any single property, market, or tenant.  Based on percentage of annualized base rent, the following table summarizes our most significant tenants, of which four of the top five are grocers:\n(1)\nIncludes Regency's Pro-rata share of unconsolidated properties and excludes those owned by anchors.\nBankruptcies and Credit Concerns\nOur management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring consumer preferences and trends, customer shopping behaviors, changes in delivery methods, shifts to e-commerce, and changing demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting our industry.  We seek to mitigate these potential impacts through maintaining a high quality portfolio, diversifying our tenant mix, replacing less successful tenants with stronger operators, anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive customer traffic, and investing in suburban trade areas with compelling demographic populations benefiting from high levels of disposal income.  The potential for a recession and the severity and duration of any economic downturn could negatively impact our existing tenants and their ability to continue to meet their lease obligations.\nAlthough base rent is derived from long-term lease contracts, tenants that file for bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores.  Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims.  As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold.  Additionally, we may incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and significant downtime to re-lease the vacated space.  In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files for bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues.  Tenants who are currently in bankruptcy and continue to occupy space in our shopping centers represent an aggregate of 0.5% of our Pro-rata annual base rent which is primarily related to Rite Aid who filed in October 2023.\n45\nResults from Operations\nResults from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, include the results of our acquisition of UBP from August 18, 2023.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022:\nRevenues changed as summarized in the following table:\nTotal lease income increased $96.5 million primarily driven by the following contractually billable components of rent to the tenants per the lease agreements:\n•\n$75.7 million increase from billable Base rent:\no\n$36.5 million increase from acquisition of UBP;\no\n$2.8 million increase from rent commencing at development properties;\no\n$4.5 million increase from acquisitions of other operating properties in 2023 and 2022; and\no\n$32.1 million net increase from same properties, including:\n▪\n$19.1 million net increase due to increases from occupancy, rent steps in existing leases, and positive rental spreads on new and renewal leases;\n▪\n$2.1 million increase related to our acquisition and resulting consolidation of four properties previously held in an unconsolidated real estate partnership during 2022; and\n▪\n$10.8 million increase due to redevelopment projects completing and operating.\n•\n$31.1 million increase from contractual Recoveries from tenants, which represents the tenants' proportionate share of the operating, maintenance, insurance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers.  Recoveries from tenants increased, on a net basis, mainly from the following:\no\n$12.7 million increase from acquisition of UBP;\no\n$1.3 million increase from rents commencing at development properties and the acquisition of other operating properties in 2022 and 2023; and\no\n$16.9 million net increase from same properties primarily due to higher operating costs in the current year.\n•\n$3.3 million increase in Percentage rent due to increases in tenant sales.\n•\n$14.4 million decrease primarily driven by the 2022 collections of previously reserve amounts, which have continued to occur in 2023, but to a lesser degree.\n•\n$5.9 million increase in Other lease income primarily due to an $3.8 million increase in lease termination fees and $2.1 million related to the acquisition of UBP.\n•\n$13.5 million decrease in Straight-line rent due to higher 2022 levels of reinstating straight-line rents from former cash basis tenants upon returning to accrual basis.\n•\n$8.3 million increase in Above and below market rent primarily driven by accelerated write offs for early tenant move-outs.\nManagement, transaction, and other fees increased $1.1 million primarily due to increased debt placement, property management and development fees from our real estate partnerships.\n46\nChanges in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table:\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased $32.6 million, as follows:\n•\n$24.0 million increase from acquisition of UBP;\n•\n$5.1 million increase from same properties, primarily driven by redevelopment projects;\n•\n$3.0 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties; and\n•\n$0.5 million increase from development properties becoming available for occupancy.\nProperty operating expense increased $33.1 million, on a net basis, as follows:\n•\n$8.1 million increase from acquisition of UBP;\n•\n$1.3 million increase from development properties;\n•\n$3.2 million increase from higher claims expense in our captive insurance company;\n•\n$2.2 million related to acquisitions of other operating properties; and\n•\n$18.3 million increase from same properties primarily attributable to an increase in recoverable common area and tenant related costs.\nReal estate taxes increased $15.8 million, on a net basis, mainly due to the following:\n•\n$8.9 million increase from acquisition of UBP;\n•\n$2.1 million increase from acquisitions of other operating properties and developments where capitalization ceased and spaces became available for occupancy; and\n•\n$4.8 million net increase from same properties primarily due to increases in real estate tax assessments across the portfolio.\nGeneral and administrative costs increased $17.9 million, on a net basis, mainly due to the following:\n•\n$10.9 million net increase due to changes in the value of participant obligations within the deferred compensation plan, attributable to changes in market values of those investments, reflected within Net investment income;\n•\n$1.1 million net increase driven by higher professional fees, business promotion and travel related costs;\n•\n$8.3 million net increase in compensation costs primarily driven by salary increases, fewer vacant positions and performance-based incentive compensation; partially offset by\n•\n$2.5 million decrease due to higher development overhead capitalization based on the timing and progress of our development and redevelopment projects.\nOther operating expenses increased $3.3 million, primarily due to transition costs related to the acquisition of UBP.\nThe following table presents the components of Other expense:\n47\nInterest expense, net increased $8.1 million primarily due to the following:\n•\n$5.8 million net increase related to loans assumed with the UBP acquisition;\n•\n$4.8 million increase driven by higher average balances on our unsecured credit facility; partially offset by\n•\n$2.5 million decrease from higher capitalization of interest due to timing of development spend and higher interest income earned on cash balances.\nDuring 2023, we recognized gains on sale of $0.7 million from three land parcels.  During 2022, we recognized gains on sale of $109.0 million from two operating property and five land parcels.\nNet investment income increased $12.6 million primarily driven by $11.0 million gains on investments held in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan which have an offsetting expense in General and administrative costs noted above and $1.6 million gains on investments held in our captive insurance company.\nTotal equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships changed as follows:\n(1)\nOn May 25, 2022, the NYC partnership sold its remaining two properties and distributed sales proceeds to its members.  Dissolution will follow final distributions, which are expected in 2024.\n(2)\nOn April 1, 2022, we acquired our partner's 75% share in four properties held in the RegCal partnership for a total purchase price of $88.5 million; therefore, results following the date of acquisition are included in consolidated results.  The remaining operating property within RegCal, LLC, was sold in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe $9.3 million decrease, on a net basis, in our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributable to the following changes:\n•\n$9.1 million decrease within NYC, primarily due to gains on the sale of two operating properties during 2022;\n•\n$1.6 million decrease within RegCal, primarily due to gain on sale of one operating property during 2022 in comparison to the one sold in 2023; partially offset by\n•\n$1.0 million increase within Other investments in real estate partnerships, related to increases in lease income at a single property partnership under redevelopment and income generated by new partnerships assumed through the UBP acquisition.\nThe following represents the remaining components that comprise Net income attributable to common shareholders and unit holders:\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nFor a comparison of our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, see \"Part II, Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2023.\n48\nSupplemental Earnings Information\nWe use certain non-GAAP measures, in addition to certain performance metrics determined under GAAP, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the operating results.  We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.  Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.  We provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, when read in conjunction with our reported results under GAAP.  We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of operating results, along with other non-GAAP measures, may assist in comparing our operating results to other REITs.  We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported non-GAAP measures could change.  See \"Defined Terms\" in \"Item 1.\nBusiness\n\" for additional information regarding the definition of and other information regarding the non-GAAP measures we present in this Report.\nWe do not consider non-GAAP measures as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders.  The principal limitation of these non-GAAP measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition, they reflect the exercise of management's judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP measures.  In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided, including as set forth below.  Non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects.\nPro-rata Same Property NOI:\nPro-rata same property NOI, excluding termination fees/expenses, changed from the following major components:\nReal estate revenue increased $44.2 million, on a net basis, as follows:\n•\nBase rent increased $32.2 million due to rent steps in existing leases, positive rental spreads on new and renewal leases, and increases in occupancy, as well as redevelopment projects completing and operating.\n•\nRecoveries from tenants increased $19.4 million due to increases in recoverable expenses.\n•\nPercentage rent increased $3.5 million, due to increases in tenant sales.\n•\nTermination fees increased $2.8 million driven by two anchor terminations recognized in 2023.\n•\nUncollectible lease income decreased $14.9 million primarily driven by the 2022 collection of previously reserved amounts, which have continued to occur in 2023, but to a lesser degree.\n49\nTotal real estate operating expense increased $26.3 million, on a net basis, as follows:\n•\nOperating and maintenance increased $20.1 million primary due to increases in common area maintenance and other tenant-recoverable costs.\n•\nReal estate taxes increased $5.9 million primary due to an increase in real estate tax assessments across the portfolio.\nSame Property Roll-forward:\nOur same property pool includes the following property count, Pro-rata GLA, and changes therein:\n(1)\nSF adjustments arising from re-measurements or redevelopments.\nNareit FFO and Core Operating Earnings:\nOur reconciliation of net income attributable to common stock and unit holders to Nareit FFO and to Core Operating Earnings is as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes Regency's Pro-rata share of unconsolidated investment partnerships, net of Pro-rata share attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n50\nReconciliation of Same Property NOI to Nearest GAAP Measure:\nOur reconciliation of Net income attributable to common shareholders to Same Property NOI, on a Pro-rata basis, is as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes straight-line rental income and expense, net of reserves, above and below market rent amortization, other fees, and noncontrolling interests.\n(2)\nIncludes non-NOI income earned and expenses incurred at our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, including those separated out above for our consolidated properties.\n(3)\nIncludes revenues and expenses attributable to non-same property, sold property, development properties, and corporate activities.  Also includes adjustments for earnings at the four properties we acquired from our former unconsolidated RegCal partnership in 2022 in order to calculate growth on a comparable basis for the periods presented.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nWe use cash flows generated from operating, investing, and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet, finance our development and redevelopment projects, fund our investment activities, and maintain financial flexibility.  A significant portion of our cash from operations is distributed to our common shareholders in the form of dividends in order to maintain our status as a REIT.\nExcept for $200 million of private placement debt, our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership.  All remaining debt is held by our Operating Partnership, its subsidiaries, or by our real estate partnerships.  The Operating Partnership is a co-issuer and a guarantor of the $200 million of outstanding debt of our Parent Company.  The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity, and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units.\nWe continually assess our available liquidity and our expected cash requirements, including monitoring our tenant rent collections.  We have access to and draw on multiple financing sources to fund our operations and our long-term capital needs, including the requirements of our in process and planned developments, redevelopments, other capital expenditures, and the repayment of debt.  We expect to meet these needs by using a combination of the following: cash flow from operations after funding our common stock and preferred stock dividends, borrowings from our Line, proceeds from the sale of real estate, mortgage loan and unsecured bank financing, distributions received from our real estate partnerships, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity securities or the issuance of new unsecured debt.  We continually evaluate alternative financing options, and we believe we can obtain new financing on reasonable terms, although likely at higher interest rates than that of our debt currently outstanding, due to the current interest rate environment.\nOn January 8, 2024, Regency priced a public offering of $400 million of senior unsecured notes due 2034 (the “2024 Notes”) under our existing shelf registration filed with the SEC. The Notes mature on January 15, 2034, and were issued at 99.617% of par value with a coupon of 5.25%.  We have $250 million of unsecured debt maturing in June 2024, which we intend to pay off by utilizing the proceeds available from the 2024 Notes.  In addition, we have $148.3 million of secured mortgage maturities during the next 12 months, including mortgages within our real estate partnerships, which we intend to refinance or pay-off as they mature.  Based upon our available cash balance, sources of capital, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs for the next year, although, in the longer term, we can provide no assurances.\n51\nIn addition to our $85.0 million of unrestricted cash, we have the following additional sources of capital available:\n(1)\nNet of letters of credit issued against our Line.\n(2)\nIn January 2024, the Company amended its Line, to, among other items, increase the borrowing capacity to $1.5 billion and to extend the maturity date to March, 2028 with the option to extend the maturity for two additional six-month periods.\nThe declaration of dividends is determined quarterly by our Board of Directors.  On February 7, 2024, our Board of Directors:\n•\nDeclared a common stock dividend of $0.67 per share, payable on April 3, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 13, 2024;\n•\nDeclared a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, which will be paid at a rate of $0.390625 per share on April 30, 2024. The dividend will be payable to holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock as of the close of business on April 15, 2024; and\n•\nDeclared a dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock, which will be paid at a rate of $0.367200 per share on April 30, 2024. The dividend will be payable to holders of record of the Series B Preferred Stock as of the close of business on April 15, 2024.\nWhile future dividends will be determined at the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  We have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions.  During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated cash flow from operations of $719.6 million and $655.8 million, respectively, and paid $458.8 million in dividends to our common and preferred stock and unit holders, and $430.1 million in dividends to our common stock and unit holders, respectively.\nWe currently have development and redevelopment projects in various stages of construction, along with a pipeline of potential projects for future development or redevelopment.  After funding our common and preferred stock dividend payments in January 2024, we estimate that we will require capital during the next 12 months of approximately $677.8 million related to leasing commissions, tenant improvements, in-process developments and redevelopments, capital contributions to our real estate partnerships, and repaying maturing debt.  These capital requirements are being impacted by inflation resulting in increased costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third party contractors and suppliers.  Further, continued challenges from permitting delays and labor shortages may extend the time to completion of these projects.  In response, we have implemented mitigation strategies such as entering into fixed cost construction contracts, pre-ordering materials, and other planning efforts.\nIf we start new developments or redevelopments, commit to property acquisitions, repay debt prior to maturity, declare future dividends, or repurchase shares of our common stock, our cash requirements will increase.  If we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease.\nWe endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. As of December 31, 2023, 87.1% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered.  Our low level of encumbered assets allows us to more readily access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain borrowing capacity on the Line.  Our trailing 12 month fixed charge coverage ratio, including our Pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 4.7x and 4.6x for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and our Pro-rata net debt and Preferred Stock-to-operating EBITDA\nre\nadjusted ratio on a trailing 12 month basis was 5.4x and 5.0x, respectively, for the same periods.  In light of the merger with UBP on August 18, 2023, the adjusted debt metric calculations include legacy Regency results for the trailing 12 months and the annualized contribution from UBP post merger.\nOur Line and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The debt assumed in conjunction with the UBP acquisition contain covenants that are consistent with our existing debt covenants.  We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2023, and expect to remain in compliance.\n52\nSummary of Cash Flow Activity\nThe following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company:\nNet cash provided by operating activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased  $63.8 million due to:\n•\n$58.7 million increase in cash from operations due to timing of receipts and payments, and\n•\n$5.1 million increase in operating cash flow distributions from Investments in real estate partnerships.\nNet cash used in investing activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities changed by $135.9 million as follows:\nSignificant changes in investing activities include:\n•\nWe paid $45.4 million in 2023 to purchase two operating properties.

During 2023, we deployed capital of $232.9 million for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties, comprised of the following:\n•\nWe paid $2.6 million to acquire one land parcel for development in 2023, and paid $12.5 million to acquire one land parcel for development and one land parcel formerly under ground lease at one of our existing centers in 2022.\n•\nBuilding and tenant improvements increased $17.2 million during 2023, primarily related to the timing of capital projects.\n•\nRedevelopment costs are $19.7 million higher in 2023 due to the timing and magnitude of projects currently in process.  We intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisition, existing building expansion, facade renovation, new out-parcel building construction, and redevelopment related tenant improvement costs.  The size and magnitude of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan.  The timing and duration of these projects could also result in volatility in NOI.  See the tables below for more details about our redevelopment projects.\n•\nDevelopment costs are higher in 2023 due to the progress towards completion of our development projects in process.  See the tables below for more details about our development projects.\n•\nInterest is capitalized on our development and redevelopment projects and is based on cumulative actual costs expended.  We cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor tenant opens for business.  If we reduce our development and redevelopment activity, the amount of interest that we capitalize may be lower than historical averages.\n•\nWe have a staff of employees who directly support our development program, which includes redevelopment of our existing properties.  Internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project.\nThe following table summarizes our development projects in-process and completed:\n(1)\nEstimated Stabilization Year represents the estimated first full calendar year that the project will reach our expected stabilized yield.\n(2)\nIncludes leasing costs and is net of tenant reimbursements.\n(3)\nEstimated Net Development Costs and GLA are reported based on Regency’s ownership interest in the real estate partnership at completion.\n(4)\nEstimated Net Development Costs for Baybrook East - Phase 1B is limited to our ownership interest in the value of land and site improvements to deliver a parcel to a grocer, under a ground lease agreement, to construct their building and improvements.  This property is included in our Investments in real estate partnerships.\n54\nThe following table summarizes our redevelopment projects in-process and completed:\n(1)\nEstimated Stabilization Year represents the estimated first full calendar year that the project will reach our expected stabilized yield.\n(2)\nIncludes leasing costs and is net of tenant reimbursements.\n(3)\nEstimated Net Development Costs and GLA are reported based on Regency’s ownership interest in the real estate partnership at completion.\nNet cash used in financing activities:\nNet cash flows used in financing activities changed during 2023, as follows:\nSignificant financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included the following:\n•\nWe received proceeds of $61.3 million, net of issue costs, in April 2022 upon settling forward equity sales under our ATM program.\n•\nWe repurchased for cash a portion of the common stock granted to employees for stock-based compensation to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements, which totaled $7.7 million and $6.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n55\n•\nWe paid $20.0 million to repurchase 349,519 shares of our common stock through our Repurchase Program during 2023, and  $75.4 million during the same period in 2022 to repurchase 1,294,201 shares of our common stock through our Repurchase Program.\n•\nWe received $2.4 million net from limited partners, including $10.2 million of contributions for their share of debt repayments and development funding, partially offset by $7.8 million in operating distributions during 2023.  During 2022, we paid $7.2 million, net to limited partners, including $15.0 million in distributions for both operating cash flows as well as a partner buyout, partially offset by $7.8 million of contributions from limited partners in new consolidated Investments in real estate partnerships.\n•\nWe paid $28.7 million more in dividends as a result of an increase in our dividend rate per share and the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, as well as preferred dividends commencing in 2023 as a result of the UBP acquisition.\n•\nWe paid $9.2 million in 2023 for the redemption of exchangeable operating partnership units.\n•\nWe received net proceeds of $152.0 million from our unsecured credit facilities to fund direct transaction costs related to the UBP acquisition.\n•\nWe had the following debt related activity during 2023:\no\nWe received $59.5 million in proceeds from a mortgage refinancing,\no\nWe paid $72.8 million for debt repayments, including:\n▪\n$11.2 million in principal mortgage payments, and\n▪\n$61.6 million for a combination of repaying or refinancing six mortgage loans at maturity.\n•\nWe had the following debt related activity during 2022:\no\nWe paid $18.0 million for secured debt payments, including:\n▪\n$6.8 million to repay one mortgage, and\n▪\n$11.2 million in principal mortgage payments.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations at December 31, 2023, which are discussed in our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and include:\n•\nMortgage loans, unsecured notes, and unsecured credit facilities as discussed in note 9, and related interest rate swaps as discussed in note 10;\n•\nWe have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center.  We also have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business.  These lease obligations are discussed in note 7;\n•\nOur share of mortgage loans within our Investments in real estate partnerships, as discussed in note 4;\n•\nLetters of credit of $8.5 million issued to cover our captive insurance program and performance obligations on certain development projects, the latter of which will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects;\n•\nObligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in note 14; and\n•\nWe will also incur obligations related to construction or development contracts on projects in process; however, future amounts under these construction contracts are not due until future satisfactory performance under the contracts.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nKnowledge about our significant accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires that we make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of the financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during the financial reporting period. These accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions are based upon, but not limited to historical experience, current trends, expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards. While the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting estimates, the estimates discussed below are believed to be critical because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.\nValuation of Real Estate Investments Acquired from Urstadt Biddle Properties, Inc.\nWe generally account for an acquisition of a single real estate property or portfolio of real estate properties as an asset acquisition. We measure the real estate assets acquired based on their total cost of the acquisition and the total cost is allocated to the real estate\n56\nproperties acquired and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. The fair value of the real estate properties acquired is based on a valuation utilizing an income approach methodology, primarily by applying a market-specific capitalization rate to the estimated stabilized net operating income of the individual real estate properties. The fair value of land acquired is generally based on a valuation utilizing a market approach methodology that identifies comparable land sales.\nKey assumptions may include stabilized net operating income and capitalization rates. Stabilized net operating income is based on several factors including property operating history, market rents, location, property conditions, amenities, local demographics, economic trends, and size of the property. We determine capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data and adjust, if necessary, based on the property characteristics. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. The use of different assumptions, judgments and estimates to value the acquired properties and allocate the most significant portion of the purchase price among the land, buildings and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities could affect the depreciation and amortization expense we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life.\nImpairment of Real Estate Investments\nIn accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are events or changes in circumstances, including property operating performance, general market conditions or changes in expected hold periods, that indicate that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  If such events or changes occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, expected hold period, comparable sales information, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction.  If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value.\nThe estimated fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is estimated through comparable sales information and other market data if available, as well as the use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  The discounted cash flow method uses similar assumptions to the undiscounted cash flow method above, as well as a discount rate.  Such cash flow projections and rates are subject to management judgment and changes in those assumptions could impact the estimation of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.  Changes in events or changes in circumstances may alter the expected hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, which primarily pertain to chemicals historically used by certain current and former dry cleaning and gas station tenants and the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers.  We believe that the relatively few tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations.  Generally, we endeavor to require tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems, in accordance with the terms of our leases.  We carry an environmental insurance policy for certain third-party liabilities and, in certain circumstances, remediation costs on shopping centers for currently unknown contamination.  We have also secured environmental insurance policies, where appropriate, on a relatively small number of specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk.  We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites.  We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had accrued liabilities of $19.4 million for our Pro-rata share of environmental remediation, including our Investments in real estate partnerships.  We believe that the ultimate remediation of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.  We can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental contamination; that our estimate of liabilities will not change as more information becomes available; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.\n57"

    "text": "We are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk:\n•\nUnder the Line, as further described in note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have a variable interest rate that, as of December 31, 2023, was based upon an annual rate of SOFR plus a 0.10% market adjustment (\"Adjusted SOFR\") plus 0.865%.  SOFR rates charged on our Line change monthly, and the applicable margin on the Line was dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings.  If our credit ratings were downgraded, the applicable margin on the Line would increase, resulting in higher interest costs.  As of December 31, 2023 the interest rate plus applicable margin based on our credit rating ranged from Adjusted SOFR plus 0.690% to Adjusted SOFR plus 1.540%.  Effective January 18, 2024, upon the Sixth Amendment to the Line, the applicable margin on the Line is dependent upon maintaining certain compliance ratios and credit ratings stipulated in the credit agreement, and the interest rate plus applicable margin based on our credit rating ranges from Adjusted SOFR plus 0.640% to Adjusted SOFR plus 1.390%.\n•\nWe are also exposed to changes in interest rates when we refinance our existing long-term fixed rate debt.  The objective of our interest rate risk management program is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows.  To achieve these objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument.  We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.  Our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection.\nWe continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt, to repay maturing debt, or to fund our commitments.  We continue to believe, in light of our credit ratings, the available capacity under our unsecured credit facility, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund maturing debt obligations.  It is uncertain the degree to which capital market volatility and rising interest rates will adversely impact the interest rates on any new debt that we may issue.\nOur interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques.  The table below presents the principal cash flows, weighted average interest rates of remaining debt, and the fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2023.  For variable rate mortgages and unsecured credit facilities for which we have interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rate, they are included in the Fixed rate debt section below at their all-in fixed rate.  The table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.  Although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table, those rates represent rates that existed as of December 31, 2023, and are subject to change on a monthly basis.  In addition, we continually assess the market risk for floating rate debt and believe that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1,557,500 per year based on $155.8 million of floating rate mortgage debt and floating rate line of credit balances outstanding at December 31, 2023.  If we increase our line of credit balance in the future, additional decreases to future earnings and cash flows could occur.\nFurther, the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2023, and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date or obligations repaid before maturity.  Since firm commitments are not presented, the table has limited predictive value.  As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and actual interest rates.\nThe table below presents the principal cash flow payments associated with our outstanding debt by year, weighted average interest rates on debt outstanding at each year-end, and fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2023.\n(1)\nReflects amount of debt maturities during each of the years presented as of December 31, 2023.\n(2)\nReflects weighted average interest rates of debt outstanding at the end of each year presented.  For variable rate debt, the rate as of December 31, 2023, was used to determine the average interest rate for all future periods.\n58"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of expected hold periods for certain real estate assets\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and presented on the consolidated balance sheet, real estate assets, less accumulated depreciation was $10.8 billion as of December 31, 2023.  The Company evaluates real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) for impairment whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of the real estate properties may not be recoverable.\nWe identified the Company’s assessment of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate a shortened expected hold period for certain real estate properties as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the events or changes in circumstances assessed by the Company that could indicate shortened expected hold periods for certain real estate properties. A shortening of the expected hold period could indicate a potential impairment.\n60\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of a control related to the Company’s assessment of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate shortened expected hold periods for certain real estate properties. To evaluate relevant events or changes in circumstances indicating a potential shortening of the expected holding period, we:\n•\ninquired of management and obtained written representations regarding potential property disposal plans, if any\n•\nread minutes of the meetings of the Company’s board of directors\n•\ninquired about the Company’s plans with those in the organization who are responsible for, and have authority over, potential disposition activities\n•\ncompared management’s assessment of properties with potential shortened expected hold periods to information obtained from those in the organization responsible for disposition activity\n•\ninspected listings from external sources of real estate properties for sale by the Company.\nAcquisition of Urstadt Biddle Properties, Inc.\nAs discussed in Note 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Urstadt Biddle Properties, Inc. (UBP) for $1.1 billion on August 18, 2023, and the acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition. In asset acquisitions, the Company measures the real estate assets acquired based on their total cost of the acquisition and the total cost is allocated to the real estate properties acquired and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. The fair value of the real estate properties acquired is based on a valuation utilizing an income approach methodology, primarily by applying a market-specific capitalization rate to the estimated stabilized net operating income of the individual real estate properties. The fair value of land acquired is generally based on a valuation utilizing a market approach methodology that identifies comparable land sales.\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value measurement of certain real estate properties acquired, including the fair value measurement of certain land acquired, in the UBP acquisition as a critical audit matter. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment and specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the capitalization rates used to measure the fair value of certain real estate properties acquired and to assess the comparable land sales used to measure the fair value of certain land acquired.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s fair value measurement process for the real estate properties acquired. This included controls over the capitalization rates used to measure the fair value of certain real estate properties acquired and the comparable land sales used to measure the fair value of certain land acquired. For certain real estate properties and land acquired we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n•\ncomparing the Company’s capitalization rate assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value of real estate properties acquired to available comparable market information and industry research publications.\n•\nevaluating the identified comparable land sales used in the measurement of the fair value of land acquired by comparing to available market information related to land sales.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1993.\nJacksonville, Florida\nFebruary 16, 2024\n61\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nRegency Centers Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Regency Centers Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nJacksonville, Florida\nFebruary 16, 2024\n62\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors of Regency Centers Corporation\nand the Partners of Regency Centers, L.P.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers, L.P. and subsidiaries (the Partnership) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

The Partnership evaluates real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) for impairment whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of the real estate properties may not be recoverable.\nWe identified the Partnership’s assessment of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate a shortened expected hold period for certain real estate properties as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the events or changes in circumstances assessed by the Partnership that could indicate shortened expected hold periods for certain real estate properties. A shortening of the expected hold period could indicate a potential impairment.\n63\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of a control related to the Partnership’s assessment of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate shortened expected hold periods for certain real estate properties. To evaluate relevant events or changes in circumstances indicating a potential shortening of the expected holding period, we:\n•\ninquired of management and obtained written representations regarding potential property disposal plans, if any\n•\nread minutes of the meetings of the general partner’s board of directors\n•\ninquired about the Partnership’s plans with those in the organization who are responsible for, and have authority over, potential disposition activities\n•\ncompared management’s assessment of properties with potential shortened expected hold periods to information obtained from those in the organization responsible for disposition activity\n•\ninspected listings from external sources of real estate properties for sale by the Partnership.\nAcquisition of Urstadt Biddle Properties, Inc.\nAs discussed in Note 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Partnership acquired Urstadt Biddle Properties, Inc. (UBP) for $1.1 billion on August 18, 2023, and the acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition. In asset acquisitions, the Partnership measures the real estate assets acquired based on their total cost of the acquisition and the total cost is allocated to the real estate properties acquired and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. The fair value of the real estate properties acquired is based on a valuation utilizing an income approach methodology, primarily by applying a market-specific capitalization rate to the estimated stabilized net operating income of the individual real estate properties. The fair value of land acquired is generally based on a valuation utilizing a market approach methodology that identifies comparable land sales.\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value measurement of certain real estate properties acquired, including the fair value measurement of certain land acquired, in the UBP acquisition as a critical audit matter. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment and specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the capitalization rates used to measure the fair value of certain real estate properties acquired and to assess the comparable land sales used to measure the fair value of certain land acquired.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Partnership's fair value measurement process for the real estate properties acquired. This included controls over the capitalization rates used to measure the fair value of certain real estate properties acquired and the comparable land sales used to measure the fair value of certain land acquired. For certain real estate properties and land acquired we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n•\ncomparing the Partnership's capitalization rate assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value of real estate properties acquired to available comparable market information and industry research publications.\n•\nevaluating the identified comparable land sales used in the measurement of the fair value of land acquired by comparing to available market information related to land sales.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Partnership's auditor since 1998.\nJacksonville, Florida\nFebruary 16, 2024\n64\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors of Regency Centers Corporation\nand the Partners of Regency Centers, L.P.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Regency Centers, L.P. and subsidiaries' (the Partnership) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Partnership as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Partnership’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nJacksonville, Florida\nFebruary 16, 2024\n65\nRE\nGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n(in thousands, except share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n66\nRE\nGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n67\nREG\nENCY CENTERS CORPORATION\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\n(in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n68\nREG\nENCY CENTERS CORPORATION\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n69\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n70\nREG\nENCY CENTERS CORPORATION\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\n(in thousands)\n71\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n72\nRE\nGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n(in thousands, except unit data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n73\nREG\nENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\n(in thousands, except per unit data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n74\nREG\nENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\n(in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n75\nREG\nENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nConsolidated Statements of Capital\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\n(in thousands)\n76\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n77\nREG\nENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\n(in thousands)\n78\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n79\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n1.\nSu\nmmary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(a)\nOrganization and Principles of Consolidation\nGeneral\nRegency Centers Corporation (the \"Parent Company\") began its operations as a REIT in 1993 and is the general partner of Regency Centers, L.P. (the \"Operating Partnership\").  The Parent Company primarily engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, development, and redevelopment of shopping centers through the Operating Partnership, and has no other assets other than through its investment in the Operating Partnership, and its only liabilities are $\n200\nmillion of unsecured private placement notes, which are co-issued and guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.  The Parent Company guarantees all of the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the \"Company\" or \"Regency\") owned\n381\nproperties and held partial interests in an additional\n101\nproperties through unconsolidated Investments in real estate partnerships (also referred to as \"joint ventures\" or \"investment partnerships\").\nAcquisition of Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc.\nOn\nMay 17, 2023\n, the Parent Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “merger agreement”) by and among the Parent Company, Hercules Merger Sub, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company (“Merger Sub”), UBP, UB Maryland I, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Urstadt Biddle (“UB Sub I”), and UB Maryland II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of UB Sub I (“UB Sub II”), pursuant to which, (a) UB Sub II merged with and into Urstadt Biddle (the “first merger”), with Urstadt Biddle surviving the first merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of UB Sub I, and (b) following the first merger, UB Sub I merged with and into Merger Sub (the “second merger” and together with the first merger, the “mergers”), with Merger Sub being the surviving entity in the second merger.\nThe combined company continues to trade under the ticker symbol “REG” on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (the “NASDAQ”).\nThe closing of the mergers completed on August 18, 2023 and each share of Urstadt Biddle’s common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share (“Urstadt Biddle common stock”), class A common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share (“Urstadt Biddle Class A common stock” and, together with Urstadt Biddle common stock, the “Urstadt Biddle common shares”),\n6.25\n% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and\n5.875\n% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock converted into\none\nequivalent share in UB Sub I, with respect to each class, subject to limited exceptions set forth in the merger agreement.  Immediately thereafter, on August 18, 2023, each share of UB Sub I’s common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, and class A common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, converted into\n0.347\nof a share of common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, of common stock of the Parent Company, without interest and subject to certain adjustments, subject to limited exceptions set forth in the merger agreement, and each share of UB Sub I’s\n6.25\n% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and\n5.875\n% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock was converted into\none\nshare of newly issued Parent Company\n6.25\n% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Parent Company Series A preferred stock”) and\n5.875\n% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Parent Company Series B preferred stock”), respectively (collectively referred to as the “Preferred Stock”).\nEstimates, Risks, and Uncert\nainties\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The most significant estimates in the Company's financial statements relate to the net carrying values of its real estate investments, collectibility of lease income, and acquired lease intangible assets and liabilities.  It is possible that the estimates and assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly if economic conditions were to weaken\n.\nThe\nsuccess of the Company's tenants in operating their businesses and their corresponding ability to pay rent continue to be  influenced by current economic challenges, which impact their cost of doing business, including but not limited to the impact of inflation, the cost and availability of labor, increasing energy prices and interest rates, and access to credit.  Additionally, macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, including the war involving Russia and Ukraine, Middle East conflicts and wars, and the economic and other possible conflicts involving China (including any slowing of its economy), could impact aspects\n80\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nof\nthe U.S. economy and, therefore, consumer spending.  The policies implemented by the U.S. government to address these issues, including raising interest rates, could result in adverse impacts on the U.S. economy, including a slowing of growth and potentially a recession, thereby impacting consumer spending, tenants' businesses, and/or decreasing future demand for space in shopping centers.  The potential impact of current macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is subject to change and continues to depend on the extent and duration of these risks and uncertainties.\nConsolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and consolidated partnerships in which the Company has a controlling financial interest.  Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company consolidates properties that are wholly-owned and properties where it owns less than 100% but has control over the activities most important to the overall success of the partnership.  Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") and voting interest entities.  For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the entity where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOwnership of the Parent Company\nThe Parent Company has a single class of common stock and two series of preferred stock outstanding.\nOwnership of the Operating Partnership\nThe Operating Partnership's capital includes Common Units and Preferred Units.  As of December 31, 2023, the Parent Company owned approximately\n99.4\n%\nor\n184,581,070\nof the\n185,688,524\nof the outstanding Common Units, with the remaining limited partner's Common Units held by third parties (\"Exchangeable operating partnership units\" or \"EOP units\").  The Parent Company currently owns all of the Preferred Units.\nEach EOP unit is exchangeable for cash or one share of common stock of the Parent Company, at the discretion of the Parent Company, and the unit holder cannot require redemption in cash or common stock (i.e., registered shares of the Parent).  The Parent Company has evaluated the conditions as specified under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 480,\nDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity\n, as it relates to EOP units outstanding and concluded that the Parent Company has the right to satisfy the redemption requirements of the units by delivering shares of unregistered common stock.  Accordingly, the Parent Company classifies EOP units as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity and Comprehensive Income.  The Parent Company serves as general partner of the Operating Partnership. The EOP unit holders have limited rights over the Operating Partnership such that they do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership’s economic performance.  As such, the Operating Partnership is considered a VIE, and the Parent Company, which consolidates it, is the primary beneficiary.  The Parent Company's only investment is the Operating Partnership. Net income and distributions of the Operating Partnership are allocable to the general and limited common Partnership Units in accordance with their ownership percentages.\nReal Estate Partnerships\nAs of December 31, 2023, Regency held partial ownership interests in\n119\nproperties through partnerships, of which\n18\nare consolidated.  Regency's partners include institutional investors and real estate developers and/or operators (the \"Partners\" or \"Limited Partners\").  These partnerships have been established to own and operate real estate property.  Regency has a variable interest in these entities through its equity ownership, with Regency being the primary beneficiary in certain of these real estate partnerships.  As such, Regency consolidates the partnerships into its financial statements for which it is the primary beneficiary and reports the limited partners' interests as noncontrolling interests.  For those partnerships which Regency is not the primary beneficiary and does not control, but has significant influence, Regency recognizes its investment in them in accordance with the equity method of accounting.\n81\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nThe assets of these partnerships are restricted to the use of the partnerships and cannot be reached by general creditors of the Company.  Similarly, the obligations of the partnerships can only be settled by the assets of these partnerships or additional contributions by the partners.  As managing member, Regency maintains the books and records and typically provides leasing property and asset management services to the partnerships.  The Partners' level of involvement in these partnerships varies from protective decisions (debt, bankruptcy, selling primary asset(s) of business) to participating involvement such as approving leases, operating budgets, and capital budgets.\n•\nCertain partnerships were deemed VIEs primarily because the unrelated investors do not have substantive kick-out rights to remove the general or managing partner by a vote of a simple majority or less, and they do not have substantive participating rights. Those partnerships for which the Partners are involved in the day to day decisions and do not have any other aspects that would cause them to be considered VIEs, are evaluated for consolidation using the voting interest model.\no\nThose partnerships in which Regency does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and Regency's ownership interest is recognized through single-line presentation as Investments in real estate partnerships, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and Equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Cash distributions of earnings from operations from Investments in real estate partnerships are presented in Cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Cash distributions from the sale of a property or loan proceeds received from the placement of debt on a property included in Investments in real estate partnerships are presented in Cash flows provided by investing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  If distributed proceeds from debt refinancing and real estate sales in excess of Regency's carrying value of its investment results in a negative investment balance for a partnership, it is recorded within Accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe net difference in the carrying amount of investments in real estate partnerships and the underlying equity in net assets is accreted to earnings and recorded in Equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations over the expected useful lives of the properties and other intangible assets, which range from\n10\nto\n40 years\n.\nThe majority of the operations of the VIEs are funded with cash flows generated by the properties, or in the case of developments, with capital contributions or third-party construction loans.\nThe major classes of assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling equity interests held by the Company's consolidated VIEs, exclusive of the Operating Partnership, are as follows:\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe Company accounts for noncontrolling interests in accordance with the Consolidation guidance and the Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity guidance issued by the FASB. Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of equity that the Company does not own in those entities it consolidates. Noncontrolling interests also include amounts related to partnership units issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the Company in connection with certain property acquisitions. These partnership units have a defined redemption amount  and the unit holders generally have the right to redeem their units at any time after a certain period from issuance. For these partnership units, the Company has the option to settle redemption amounts in cash or common stock. The Company evaluates the terms of the partnership units issued in accordance with the FASB’s Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity guidance. The partnership units for which the Company has the option to settle redemption amounts in cash or common stock are included in the caption Noncontrolling interests within the equity section on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n82\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nNoncontrolling Interests of the Parent Company\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company include the following ownership interests held by owners other than the common shareholders of the Parent Company: (i) the EOP units and (ii) the minority-owned interest held by third parties in consolidated partnerships (\"Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships\").  The Parent Company has included all of these noncontrolling interests in permanent equity, separate from the Parent Company's shareholders' equity, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.  The portion of net income or comprehensive income attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income and comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income of the Parent Company.\nThe Parent Company also evaluated its fiduciary duties to itself, its shareholders, and, as the managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, to the Operating Partnership, and concluded its fiduciary duties are not in conflict with each other or the underlying agreements.  Therefore, the Parent Company classifies such units and interests as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.\nNoncontrolling Interests of the Operating Partnership\nThe Operating Partnership has determined that limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are noncontrolling interests.  Subject to certain conditions and pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, the Company generally has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the other members' interest or sell its own interest in these consolidated partnerships.  The Operating Partnership has included these noncontrolling interests in permanent capital, separate from partners' capital, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Capital.  The portion of net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in Net income and Comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements Comprehensive Income of the Operating Partnership.\n(b)\nRevenues and Tenant Receivable\nLeasing Income and Tenant Receivables\nThe Company leases space to tenants under agreements with varying terms that generally provide for fixed payments of base rent, with stated increases over the term of the lease.  Some of the lease agreements contain provisions that provide for additional rents based on tenants' sales volume (\"percentage rent\"), which are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements.  Additionally, most lease agreements contain provisions for reimbursement of the tenants' share of actual real estate taxes and insurance and common area maintenance (\"CAM\") costs (collectively \"Recoverable Costs\") incurred.\nLease terms generally range from\nthree\nto\nseven years\nfor tenant spaces under\n10,000\nsquare feet (\"Shop Space\") and in excess of\nfive years\nfor spaces greater than\n10,000\nsquare feet (\"Anchor Space\").  Many leases also provide tenants the option to extend their lease beyond the initial term of the lease.  If a tenant does not exercise its option or otherwise negotiate to renew, the lease expires and the lease contains an obligation for the tenant to relinquish its space, allowing it to be re-leased to a new tenant.  This generally involves some level of cost to prepare the space for re-leasing, which is capitalized and depreciated over the shorter period of the life of the subsequent lease or the useful life of the improvement.\nThe Company accounts for its leases under ASC Topic 842,\nLeases\n(\"Topic 842\"), as follows:\nClassification\nUnder Topic 842, new leases or modifications thereto must be evaluated against specific classification criteria, which, based on the customary terms of the Company's leases, are classified as operating leases.  However, certain longer-term leases (both lessee and lessor leases) may be classified as direct financing or sales type leases, which may result in selling profit and an accelerated pattern of earnings recognition.  At December 31, 2023, the Company classified one lease as a sales type lease, with all others classified as operating leases.\n83\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nRecognition and Presentation\nLease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable.  CAM is considered a non-lease component of the lease contract under Topic 842.  However, as the timing and pattern of providing the CAM service to the tenant is the same as the timing and pattern of the tenant's use of the underlying lease asset, the Company elected, as part of an available practical expedient, to combine CAM with the remaining lease components, along with tenant's reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance, and recognize them together as Lease income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor sales type leases, the Company records any selling profit or loss arising from the lease at inception within Gain on sale of real estate, net of tax in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations, as well as any initial direct costs recorded as an expense if, at commencement, the fair value of the underlying asset differs from its carrying amount, otherwise, they are deferred and included in the net investment in the lease.  The net investment in the sales-type lease represents the lease receivable, the components of which are the future lease payments and any guaranteed residual value for the underlying assets, as well as any unguaranteed residual asset expected at the end of the lease term, each measured at net present value discounted using a rate implicit in the lease.  Interest income is recorded within Lease income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net investment in the leases.  At the commencement date, the Company derecognizes the carrying amount of the underlying asset.  When measuring the net investment in a long-term ground lease, the undiscounted residual value of the land will be limited to its fair value at commencement which will likely equate to its cost.\nCollectibility\nAt lease commencement, the Company generally expects that collectibility of substantially all payments due under the lease is probable due to the Company's credit checks on tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease; therefore, income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straight-line basis.  For operating leases in which collectibility of Lease income is not considered probable, Lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized straight-line rent receivables are reversed in the period in which the Lease income is determined not to be probable of collection.  Should collectibility of Lease income become probable again, through evaluation of qualitative and quantitative measures on a tenant by tenant basis, accrual basis accounting resumes and all commencement-to-date straight-line rent is recognized in that period.\nIn addition to the lease-specific collectibility assessment performed under Topic 842, the Company may also recognize a general reserve, as a reduction to Lease income, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the Company's historical collection experience.  The Company estimates the collectibility of the accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rents, recoveries from tenants, and other revenue taking into consideration the Company's historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and remaining lease terms.  Uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against Lease income.  Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.\nThe following table represents the components of Tenant and other receivables, net of amounts considered uncollectible, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n(1)\nOther receivables include construction receivables, insurance receivables, and amounts due from real estate partnerships for Management, transaction and other fee income.\n84\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nReal Estate Sales\nThe Company accounts for sales of nonfinancial assets under ASC Subtopic 610-20,\nOther Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\n, whereby the Company derecognizes real estate and recognizes a gain or loss on sales when a contract exists and control of the property has transferred to the buyer.  Control of the property, including controlling financial interest, is generally considered to transfer upon closing through transfer of the legal title and possession of the property.  While generally rare, any retained noncontrolling interest is measured at fair value at that time.\nManagement Services and Other Property Income\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n(\"Topic 606\")\n,\nwhen or as control of the promised services are transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.  The following is a description of the Company's revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of Topic 606.\nProperty and Asset Management Services\nThe Company is engaged under agreements with its joint venture partnerships, which are generally perpetual in nature and cancellable through unanimous partner approval, absent an event of default.  Under these agreements, the Company is to provide asset and property management and leasing services for the joint ventures' shopping centers.  The fees are market-based, generally calculated as a percentage of either revenues earned or the estimated values of the properties managed or the proceeds received, and are recognized over the monthly or quarterly periods as services are rendered.  Property management and asset management services represent a series of distinct daily services.  Accordingly, the Company satisfies its performance obligation as service is rendered each day and the variability associated with that compensation is resolved each day.  Amounts due from the partnerships for such services are paid during the month following the monthly or quarterly service periods.\nSeveral of the Company's partnership agreements provide for incentive payments, generally referred to as \"promotes\" or \"earnouts,\" to Regency for appreciation in property values in Regency's capacity as managing member.  The terms of these promotes are based on appreciation in real estate value over designated time intervals or upon designated events.  The Company evaluates its expected promote payout at each reporting period, which generally does not result in revenue recognition until the measurement period has completed, when the amount can be reasonably determined and the amount is not probable of significant reversal.\nLeasing Services\nLeasing service fees are based on a percentage of the total rent due under the lease.  The leasing service is considered performed upon successful execution of an acceptable tenant lease for the joint ventures' shopping centers, at which time revenue is recognized.  Payment of the first half of the fee\nis generally due upon lease execution and the second half is generally due upon tenant opening or the commencement of rent payments.\nTransaction Services\nThe Company also receives transaction fees, as contractually agreed upon with each joint venture, which include acquisition fees, disposition fees, and financing service fees.  Control of these services is generally transferred at the time the related transaction closes, which is the point in time when the Company recognizes the related fee revenue.  Any unpaid amounts related to transaction-based fees are included in Tenant and other receivables within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther Property Income\nOther property income includes parking fees and other incidental income from the properties and is generally recognized at the point in time that the performance obligation is met.\n85\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nIncome within Management, transaction, and other fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is primarily from contracts with the Company's real estate partnerships.\nThe primary components of these revenue streams, the timing of satisfying the performance obligations, and amounts are as follows:\n(1)\nThe Company recog\nnized\n$\n13.6\nmillion\nin p\nromote revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, for exceeding partnership return hurdles from the Company's performance as managing member in the USAA partnership.  The consideration was paid in the form of a real estate asset.\nThe accounts receivable for management services, which are included within Tenant and other receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, are $\n18.5\nmillion\nand $\n16.4\nmillion\n, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively.\n(c)\nReal Estate Assets\nThe following table details the components of Real estate assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nCapitalization and Depreciation\nReal estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, and amortization. The Company periodically assesses the useful lives of its depreciable real estate assets, including those intended to be redeveloped in the near term, and accounts for any revisions prospectively. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and demolition costs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.\nAs part of the leasing process, the Company may provide lessees with allowances for the construction of leasehold improvements.  These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the remaining lease term.  If the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of Lease income.  Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and provisions for substantiation of such costs (e.g. unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process).  Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of approximately\n15\nyears for land improvements,\n40\nyears for buildings and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term.\n86\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nDevelopment and Redevelopment Costs\nAll specifically identifiable costs related to development and redevelopment activities are capitalized into Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are included in Construction in progress within the above table.  The capitalized costs include pre-development costs essential to the development or redevelopment of the property, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, insurance, legal costs, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development or redevelopment.\nPre-development costs represent the costs the Company incurs prior to land acquisition or pursuing a redevelopment including contract deposits, as well as legal, engineering, and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing or redeveloping a shopping center.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had nonrefundable deposits and other pre-development costs of approximately\n$\n7.7\nmillion\nand\n$\n6.9\nmillion\n, respectively.  If the Company determines that the development or redevelopment of a particular shopping center is no longer probable, any related pre-development costs previously capitalized are immediately expensed.  During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company expensed pre-development costs of approximately\n$\n0.1\nmillion\n,\n$\n0.6\nmillion\n, and\n$\n1.5\nmillion\n, respectively, in Other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest costs are capitalized into each development and redevelopment project based upon applying the Company's weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development or redevelopment costs incurred.  The Company discontinues interest and real estate tax capitalization when a project is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would the Company capitalize interest on a project beyond\n12\nmonths after substantial comple\ntion of the building.  During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company capitalized interest of\n$\n5.7\nmillion\n,\n$\n4.2\nmillion\n, and\n$\n4.2\nmillion\n, respectively, on our development and redevelopment projects.\nWe have a staff of employees directly supporting our development and redevelopment program.  All direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development and redevelopment project.  The capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring.  During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we capitalized\n$\n13.3\nmillion\n,\n$\n10.8\nmillion\n, and\n$\n11.3\nmillion\n, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development and redevelopment program.\nAcquisitions\nUpon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date.  Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price of the acquired properties based on their relative fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities.  Acquisitions of operating properties are generally considered asset acquisitions and therefore transaction costs are capitalized.  Fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe Company's methodology includes estimating an \"as-if vacant\" fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements.  In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases.\nThe value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period.  The value of in-place leases is recorded to Depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases.\nAbove-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.  The value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of below-market leases is accreted to Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.\n87\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nThe Company does not assign value to customer\nrelationship intangibles if it has pre-existing business relationships with major retailers at the acquired property since they do not provide incremental value over the Company's existing relationships.\nHeld for Sale\nThe Company classifies real estate assets as held-for-sale upon satisfaction of all the following criteria: (i) management commits to a plan to sell a property (or group of properties), (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such properties, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the property have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the property is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year, (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale, and (vi) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.  Upon the determination to classify a property as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation and amortization on the real estate property held for sale, as well as the amortization of any related intangible assets. Such properties are recorded at the lesser of the carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nValuation of Real Estate Investments and Impairments\nThe Company continually evaluates whether there are any events or changes in circumstances, that could indicate the carrying values of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of the asset group by estimating whether the Company will recover the carrying value of the asset group through its undiscounted future cash flows, including eventual disposition. Based on this analysis, if the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment charge will be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset group.\nEstimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, expected hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results.  Changes in events or changes in circumstances may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.  If a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held for sale, the Company estimates fair value, less expected costs to sell, which could cause the Company to determine that the property is impaired.\nThe estimated fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is estimated through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  The discounted cash flow approach uses similar assumptions to the undiscounted cash flow approach above, as well as a discount rate.  Such cash flow projections and rates are subject to management judgment and changes in those assumptions could impact the estimate of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, the Company generally uses market data and comparable sales information.\n(d)\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nAny instruments which have\nan original maturity of\n90 days or less\nwhen purchased are considered cash equivalents.  As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022,\n$\n6.4\nmillion\nand\n$\n2.3\nmillion\n, respectively, of cash was restricted through escrow agreements and certain mortgage loans.\n(e)\nOther Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price consideration from the Equity One merger in 2017 over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350,\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\n, and allocates its goodwill to its reporting units, which have been determined to be at the individual property level.  The Company performs an impairment evaluation of its goodwill at least annually, in November of each year, or more frequently as triggers occur.  See note 5.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation is completed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach.  Under a qualitative approach, the impairment review for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, including goodwill.  If a qualitative approach indicates it is more\n88\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nlikely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit (including goodwill) exceeds its fair value, or if the Company chooses to bypass the qualitative approach for any reporting unit, the Company will perform the quantitative approach described below.\nThe quantitative approach consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted projected future cash flows and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values, which include the allocated goodwill.  If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company would then recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nInvestments\nThe Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date.  The fair value of securities is determined using quoted market prices.\nDebt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.  Debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized through earnings in Investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or as trading, are classified as available-for-sale, and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income and presented within Investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative instruments.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company's derivative instruments are used to manage fluctuations in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company's borrowings.\nAll derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.  Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.  Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.  The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or forecasted transaction, and the Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges generally involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  The Company may also utilize cash flow hedges to lock U.S. Treasury rates in anticipation of future fixed-rate debt issuances.  The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\").  Upon the settlement of a hedge, gains and losses remaining in AOCI are amortized through earnings over the underlying term of the hedged transaction.  The cash receipts or payments related to interest rate swaps are presented in cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n89\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nThe Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions.  The Company assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows and/or forecasted cash flows of the hedged items.\nIn assessing the valuation of the hedges, the Company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination costs at each balance sheet date.  All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.\n(f)\nDeferred Leasing Costs\nDeferred leasing costs consist of costs associated with leasing the Company's shopping centers, and are presented net of accumulated amortization.  Such costs are amortized over the period through lease expiration.  If the lease is terminated early, the remaining leasing costs are written off.\nUnder ASC Topic 842, the Company, as a lessor, may only defer as initial direct costs the incremental costs of a tenant's operating lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained.  These costs generally consist of third party broker payments.  Non-contingent internal leasing and legal costs associated with leasing activities are expensed within General and administrative expenses.\n(g)\nIncome Taxes\nThe Parent Company believes it qualifies, and intends to continue to qualify, as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Parent Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its shareholders are at least equal to REIT taxable income.  All wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be a TRS or qualify as a REIT.  The TRS's are subject to federal and state income taxes and file separate tax returns.  As a pass through entity, the Operating Partnership generally does not pay taxes, but its taxable income or loss is reported by its partners, of which the Parent Company, as general partner and approximately\n99.4\n%\nowner, is allocated its Pro-rata share of tax attributes.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes related to its TRS's under the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in\neffect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is believed that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards, tax planning strategies and recent and projected results of operations in order to make that determination.\nIn addition, tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.  Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.  The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years (2020 and forward for federal and state) based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.\n(h)\nLease Obligations\nThe Company has certain properties within its consolidated real estate portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties, which are all classified as operating leases.  Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold or similar interest in these properties.  The building and improvements constructed on the leased land are capitalized as Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\n90\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nIn addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which it conducts its business.   Leasehold improvements are capitalized as tenant improvements, included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\nUnder Topic 842, the Company recognizes Lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for its ground and office leases and corresponding Right of use assets related to these same ground and office leases which are classified as operating leases.  A key input in estimating the Lease liabilities and resulting Right of use assets is establishing the discount rate in the lease, which since the rates implicit in the lease contracts are not readily determinable, requires additional inputs for the longer-term ground leases, including market-based interest rates that correspond with the remaining term of the lease, the Company's credit spread, and a securitization adjustment necessary to reflect the collateralized payment terms present in the lease.  This discount rate is applied to the remaining unpaid minimum rental payments for each lease to measure the operating lease liabilities.\nThe ground and office lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases, including management's estimate of expected optional renewal periods.  For ground leases, the Company generally assumes it will exercise options through the latest option date of that shopping center's anchor tenant lease.\n(i)\nEarnings per Share and Unit\nBasic earnings per share of common stock and unit are computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and units, respectively, outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share and unit reflect the conversion of obligations and the assumed exercises of securities including the effects of shares issuable under the Company's share-based payment arrangements, if dilutive.  Dividends paid on the Company's share-based compensation awards are not participating securities as they are forfeitable.\n(j)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees and directors.  The Company recognizes the cost of stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award, which is expensed over the vesting period.\nWhen the Parent Company issues common stock as compensation, it receives an equal number of common units from the Operating Partnership.  The Company is committed to contributing to the Operating Partnership all proceeds from the share-based awards granted under the Parent Company's Long-Term Omnibus Plan (the \"Plan\").  Accordingly, the Parent Company's ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase based on the amount of proceeds contributed to the Operating Partnership for the common units it receives.  As a result of the issuance of common units to the Parent Company for stock-based compensation, the Operating Partnership records the effect of stock-based compensation for awards of equity in the Parent Company.\n(k)\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company's business is investing in retail shopping centers through direct ownership or partnership interests.  The Company actively manages its portfolio of retail shopping centers and may from time to time make decisions to sell lower performing properties or developments not meeting its long-term investment objectives.  The proceeds from sales are generally reinvested into higher quality retail shopping centers, through acquisitions, new developments, or redevelopment of existing centers, which management believes will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns.  It is management's intent that all retail shopping centers will be owned or developed for investment purposes; however, the  Company may decide to\nsell all or a portion of a development upon completion.  The Company's revenues and net income are generated from the operation of its investment portfolio.  The Company also earns fees for services provided to manage and lease retail shopping centers owned through joint ventures.\nThe Company's portfolio is located throughout the United States.  Management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of allocating resources or capital.  The Company’s chief operating decision maker evaluates operating and financial performance for each property on an individual property level; therefore, the Company defines an operating segment as its individual properties.  The individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their similarities with regard to both the nature and economics of the centers, tenants and operational processes, as well as long-term average financial performance.\n(l)\nBusiness Concentration\nGrocer anchor tenants represent approximately\n20.0\n%\nof Pro-rata annual base rent.\nNo\nsingle tenant accounts for\n10\n% or more of revenue and\nnone\nof the shopping centers are located outside the United States.\n91\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n(m)\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is intended to be a market-based measurement, as opposed to a transaction-specific measurement. Fair value is defined by ASC 820 as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n•\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n•\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.\nThe Company also re-measures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at fair value in subsequent periods if a re-measurement event occurs.\n92\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n(n)\tRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements and expected impact on our financial statements:\n93\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n2.\nReal Estate Investments\nUBP Acquisition\nGeneral\nWith respect to the acquisition of UBP discussed in Note 1 - Acquisition of Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc,\nthe following table provides the components that make up the total purchase price for the UBP acquisition:\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe acquisition has been accounted for using the asset acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires, among other things, that the total cost or total consideration exchanged be allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. All the other assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, including notes payable, are recorded at fair value.\nThe total purchase price, including direct transaction costs capitalized, was allocated as follows:\nThe acquired assets and assumed liabilities for an acquired operating property generally include, but are not limited to: land, buildings and improvements, identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities associated with in-place leases, including tenant improvements, leasing costs, value of above-market and below-market leases, and value of acquired in-place leases.  This methodology includes estimating an “as-if vacant” fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements and also determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases.  The fair market value of the acquired operating properties is based on a valuation prepared by Regency with assistance of a third party valuation specialist.  The third-party specialist utilized stabilized NOI and market specific capitalization rates as the primary valuation inputs in determining the fair value of the real estate assets. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. Management reviews the inputs used by the third-party specialist as well as the allocation of the purchase price to ensure reasonableness and that the procedures are performed in accordance with management's policy.  Management and the third-party valuation specialist prepared their fair value estimates for each of the operating properties acquired.  The allocation of the purchase price described above requires a significant amount of judgment and represents management's best estimate of the fair value as of the acquisition date.\n94\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nThe following table details the weighted average  amortization and net accretion periods, in years, of the major classes of intangible assets and intangible liabilities arising from the UBP acquisition:\nOther Acquisitions\nThe following tables detail the other properties acquired for the periods set forth below:\n(1)\nAmounts for purchase price and allocation are reflected at\n100\n%.\n(1)\nAmounts for purchase price and allocation are reflected at\n100\n%.\n(2)\nThese properties were part of the four property portfolio purchased from an existing unconsolidated real partnership, RegCal, LLC, in which the Company held a\n25\n% ownership interest.  The basis allocated to Real estate assets was $\n93.2\nmillion on a combined basis, including the Company's carry over basis related to its\n25\n% previously owned equity investment in the partnership.\nIn addition to the acquisitions listed above, the Company acquired, for $\n9.0\nmillion, the remaining\n50\n% ownership interest from its partner in Kroger New Albany Center, an existing consolidated property.\n3.\nProperty Dispositions\nThe following table provides a summary of consolidated shopping centers and land parcels sold during the periods set forth below:\n95\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n4.\nInvestments in Real Estate Partnerships\nThe Company invests in real estate partnerships, which consist of the following:\n(1)\nNew York Common Retirement Fund (NYC) and RegCal, LLC (RegCal)\nno\nlonger have any operating properties and any residual balances have been included in Others as of December 31, 2023.

Refinancing debt at maturity in the current interest rate environment could result in higher interest expense in future periods if rates remain elevated.  The Company is obligated to contribute its Pro-rata share to fund maturities if the loans are not refinanced, and it has the capacity to do so from existing cash balances, availability on its line of credit, and operating cash flows.  The Company believes that its partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements.  In the event that a real estate partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the real estate partnership, the Company would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call which would be secured by the partner's membership interest.\nManagement fee income\nIn addition to earning our Pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these real estate partnerships, we receive fees as discussed in Note 1, as follows:\n(1)\nIn connection with the USAA partnership, we received and recognized a one-time promote fee of $\n13.6\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021, in consideration for exceeding return thresholds resulting from our performance as managing member.\n5.\nOther Assets\nThe following table represents the components of Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the periods set forth below:\nThe following table presents the goodwill balances and activity during the year to date periods ended:\nAs the Company identifies properties (\"reporting units\") that no longer meet its investment criteria, it will evaluate the property for potential sale.  A decision to sell a reporting unit results in the need to evaluate its goodwill for recoverability and may result in impairment.  Additionally, other changes impacting a reporting unit may be considered a triggering event.  If events occur that trigger an impairment evaluation at multiple reporting units, a goodwill impairment may be significant.\n99\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n6.\nAcquired Lease Intangibles\nThe Company had the following acquired lease intangibles as of the periods set forth below:\nThe following table provides a summary of amortization and net accretion amounts from acquired lease intangibles:\nThe estimated aggregate amortization and net accretion amounts from acquired lease intangibles for the next five years are as follows:\n7.\nLeases\nLessor Accounting\nSubstantially all of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases.  The Company's Lease income is comprised of both fixed and variable income.  Fixed and in-substance fixed lease income includes stated amounts per lease contracts, which are primarily related to base rent, and in some cases stated amounts for CAM, real estate taxes, and insurance (\"Recoverable Costs\").  Income for these amounts is recognized on a straight-line basis.\nVariable lease income includes the following two main items in the lease contracts:\n(i)\nRecoveries from tenants represent the tenants' contractual obligations to reimburse the Company for their portion of recoverable costs incurred.  Generally, the Company's leases provide for the tenants to reimburse the Company based on the tenants' share of the actual costs incurred in proportion to the tenants' share of leased space in the property.\n(ii)\nPercentage rent represents amounts billable to tenants based on the tenants' actual sales volume in excess of levels specified in the lease contract.\n100\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nThe following table provides a disaggregation of lease income recognized as either fixed or variable lease income based on the criteria specified in Topic 842:\nFuture minimum rents under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding variable lease payments, are as follows:\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had one lease classified as a sales-type lease, with lease income recorded over the lease term in the form of variable interest income representing the constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net investment in the lease, and fixed contractual obligations.\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company has shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable, long-term ground leases where a third party owns the underlying land and has leased the land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping center.\nThe Company has\n21\nproperties within its consolidated real estate portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties.  Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold or similar interest in these properties.  These ground leases expire through the year\n2121\n, and in most cases, provide for renewal options.\nIn addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which it conducts its business.  Office leases expire through the year\n2029\n, and in many cases, provide for renewal options.\nThe ground and office lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases, including management's estimate of expected optional renewal periods, with ground lease expense presented within Property operating expense, and office lease expense presented within General and administrative in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n101\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nOperating lease expense under the Company's ground and office leases were as follows, including straight-line rent expense and variable lease expenses such as CPI increases, percentage rent and reimbursements of landlord costs:\nThe following table summarizes the undiscounted future cash flows by year attributable to the operating lease liabilities for ground and office leases as of\nDecember 31, 2023, and provides a reconciliation to the Lease liability included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n8.\tIncome Taxes\nThe Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with certain of its subsidiaries treated as taxable REIT subsidiary entities, which are subject to federal and state income taxes.\nThe following table summarizes the tax status of dividends paid on our common stock:\n(1)\nDuring 2023, the Company declared four quarterly dividends, the last of which was paid on January 3, 2024, with a portion allocated to the 2023 dividend period, and the balance allocated to 2024.\n(2)\nDuring 2022, the Company declared four quarterly dividends, the last of which was paid on January 4, 2023, with a portion allocated to the 2022 dividend period, and the balance allocated to 2023.\n(3)\nDuring 2021, the Company declared four quarterly dividends, the last of which was paid on January 5, 2022, with a portion allocated to the 2021 dividend period, and the balance allocated to 2022.\n(4)\nOf the total capital gain distribution during 2021,\n42\n% is excluded under Reg. 1.1061-4(b)(7).  The remaining\n58\n% is a Three Year Amount under Reg. 1.1061-6(c).\n102\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nThe following table summarizes the tax status of dividends paid on our Series A preferred stock:\nThe following table summarizes the tax status of dividends paid on our Series B preferred stock:\nOur consolidated expense (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was as follows:\n(1)\nIncluded within Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe TRS entities are subject to federal and state income taxes and file separate tax returns.

Based on these swap agreements, the effective fixed rates of the 15 loans range from\n2.5\n%\nto\n6.7\n%\n.\n(2)\nWeighted average effective rate for the Line is calculated based on a fully drawn Line balance using the period end variable rate. In January 2024, the Company amended its Line to, among other items, increase the borrowing capacity to $\n1.5\nbillion and to extend the expiration date to\nMarch, 2028\nwith the option to extend the expiration for\ntwo additional six-month period\n.\nNotes Payable\nNotes payable consist of mortgage loans secured by properties and unsecured public and private debt.  Mortgage loans may be repaid before maturity, but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums, and are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest or interest only.  Unsecured public debt may be repaid before maturity subject to accrued and unpaid interest through the proposed redemption date and a make-whole premium.  Interest on unsecured public and private debt is payable semi-annually.\nThe Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants for its unsecured public debt as defined in the indenture agreements such as the following ratios: Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Assets, Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated Assets, Consolidated Income for Debt Service to Consolidated Debt Service, and Unencumbered Consolidated Assets to Unsecured Consolidated Debt.  As of December 31, 2023, management of the Company believes it is in compliance with all financial covenants for its unsecured public debt.\n104\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nUnsecured Credit Facilities\nThe Company has an unsecured line of credit commitment (the \"Line\") with a syndicate of banks.  At December 31, 2023\n, the Line had a borrowing capacity of $\n1.25\nbillion, which is reduced by the balance of outstanding borrowings and commitments from issued letters of credit.  The Line bears interest at a variable rate of\nSOFR plu\ns a 0.10% market adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.865%\n, and is subject to a commitment fee of\n0.15\n%.  Both the applicable margin and the commitment fee are based on the Company's corporate credit rating.\nThe Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants as defined in the Line credit agreement, such as Ratio of Indebtedness to Total Asset Value (\"TAV\"), Ratio of Unsecured Indebtedness to Unencumbered Asset Value, Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges, Ratio of Secured Indebtedness to TAV, Ratio of Unencumbered Net Operating Income to Unsecured Interest Expense, and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company is in compliance with all financial covenants for the Line.\nOn January 8, 2024, the Company priced a public offering of $\n400\nmillion of senior unsecured debt due in 2034, and were issued at\n99.617\n% of par value with a coupon of\n5.250\n%.\nOn January 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), with the financial institutions party thereto, as Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of $\n1.50\nbillion for a term of\nfour years\n(plus\ntwo six-month extension options\n) and includes an accordion feature which permits the borrower to request increases in the size of the revolving loan facility by up to an additional $\n1.50\nbillion. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility is equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus a margin that is determined based on the borrower’s long-term unsecured debt ratings and ratio of indebtedness to total asset value. At the time of the closing, the effective interest rate was SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of\n10\nbasis points plus a margin of\n72.5\nbasis points. The Credit Agreement also incorporates sustainability-linked adjustments to the interest rate, which provide for upward or downward adjustments to the applicable margin if the Company achieves, or fails to achieve, certain specified targets based on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission standards as set forth in the Credit Agreement. At the time of the closing, a\n1\nbasis point downward sustainability-linked adjustment to the interest rate was applicable.  The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is\nMarch 23, 2028\nwith the option to extend the expiration for\ntwo additional six month periods\n.\nScheduled principal payments and maturities on notes payable and unsecured credit facilities were as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes unsecured public and private debt and unsecured credit facilities\n.\n105\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nIn connection with the acquisition of UBP on August 18, 2023, the Company completed the following debt transactions:\n•\nAssumed fixed rate debt of $\n130.0\nmillion in the aggregate (including a mark to market debt discount of $\n13.6\nmillion) that, on a property-by-property basis, encumbers\n11\noperating properties, and includes one unsecured note.  This indebtedness has scheduled maturity dates ranging from\nAugust 2024\nto\nJune 2037\n, and accrues interest at rates ranging from\n3.5\n% to\n5.6\n% per annum.\n•\nAssumed variable rate debt of $\n154.7\nmillion in the aggregate (including a mark to market debt premium of  $\n1.1\nmillion) that collectively encumbers\n9\noperating properties.  This indebtedness has interest rate swaps in place to mitigate rate fluctuation risk.  Based on these swap agreements, the effective fixed rates range from\n3.1\n% to\n4.8\n% per annum.  The scheduled maturity dates range from\nAugust 2024\nto\nJanuary 2032\n.\nThe Company was in compliance as of December 31, 2023, with all financial and other covenants under its unsecured public and private placement debt and unsecured credit facilities.\n10.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors, and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.  The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.  The Company does not intend to utilize derivatives for speculative transactions or purposes other than mitigation of interest rate risk.  The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements.  To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with quality credit ratings.  The Company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations.\nThe Company's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to attempt to stabilize interest expense where possible and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.\nThe following table summarizes the terms and fair values of the Company's derivative financial instruments, as well as their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n(1)\nDerivatives in an asset position are included within Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, while those in a liability position are included within Accounts payable and other liabilities.\n(2)\nDerivative instruments assumed as part of the UBP acquisitions.\n106\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nThese derivative financial instruments are all interest rate swaps, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and, as of December 31, 2023, does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.\nThe changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.\nThe following table represents the effect of the derivative financial instruments on the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements:\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company expects approximately $\n10.6\nmillion\nof accumulated comprehensive income on derivative instruments in AOCI, including the Company's share from its Investments in real estate partnerships, to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months.\n11.\nFair Value Measurements\n(a)\nDisclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nAll financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts which, in management's estimation, reasonably approximate their fair values, except for the following:\nThe above fair values represent management's estimate of the amounts that would be received from selling those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  These fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe Company develops its judgments based on the best information available at the measurement date, including expected cash flows, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates, and available observable and unobservable inputs.  Service providers involved in fair value measurements are evaluated for competency and qualifications on an ongoing basis.  As considerable judgment is often necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments, the fair values presented above are not necessarily indicative of amounts that will be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.\n107\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n(b)\nFair Value Measurements\nThe following financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nSecurities\nThe Company has investments in marketable securities that are included within Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of the securities was determined using quoted prices in active markets, which are considered Level 1 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Changes in the value of securities are recorded within Net investment (income) loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, and include unrealized gains of\n$\n4.2\nmillion\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, unrealized losses of\n$\n8.0\nmillion\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 and unrealized gains of\n$\n1.7\nmillion\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities consist of investments in certificates of deposit and corporate bonds, and are recorded at fair value using either recent trade prices for the identical debt instrument or comparable instruments by issuers of similar industry sector, issuer rating, and size, to estimate fair value, which are considered Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Unrealized gains or losses on these debt securities are recognized through Other comprehensive income.\nInterest Rate Derivatives\nThe fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.\nAlthough the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.  The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate swaps.  As a result, the Company determined that its interest rate swaps valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following tables present the placement in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n108\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 and  December 31, 2022\n, there were no real estate assets re-measured to estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\n12.\nEquity and Capital\nUBP Acquisition\nSee Note 1 — Acquisition of Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc, for discussion regarding UBP acquisition.\nPreferred Stock of the Parent Company\nTerms and conditions of the preferred stock outstanding are summarized as follows:\nEach series of Preferred Stock is non-voting, has no stated maturity and is redeemable for cash at $\n25.00\nper share at the Company's option, except that the Parent Company Series B preferred stock is not redeemable until on or after October 1, 2024. The holders of the Preferred Stock have general preference rights over common stock holders with respect to liquidation and quarterly distributions. Except under certain limited conditions, holders of the Preferred Stock will not be entitled to vote. In the event of a cumulative arrearage equal to six quarterly dividends, holders of the Preferred Stock (voting as a single class without regard to series) will have the right to elect two additional members to serve on the Company's Board of Directors until the arrearage has been cured. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, as defined in the Company's Articles of Incorporation, the holders of the Preferred Stock will have the right to convert all or part of the shares of the Preferred Stock held by such holders on the applicable conversion date into a number of shares of Common Stock.\nDividends Declared\nOn\nFebruary 7, 2024\n, the Board:\n•\nDeclared a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, which will be paid at a rate of $\n0.390625\nper share on\nApril 30, 2024\n.

The timing of sales, if any, will be dependent on market conditions and other factors.  No sales occurred under the ATM program during 2023. As of\nDecember 31, 2023,\n$\n500\nmillion of common\nstock remained available for issuance under this ATM equity program.\nStock Repurchase Program\nThe Board has authorized a\ntwo-year\ncommon stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of $\n250\nmillion of its outstanding common stock through open market purchases, and/or in privately negotiated transactions (referred to as the \"Repurchase Program\").  The timing and price of stock repurchases, if any will be dependent upon market conditions and other factors.  The stock repurchased, if not retired, would be treated as treasury stock.  The Board's authorization for this Repurchase Program will expire on\nFebruary 7, 2025\n, unless modified, extended or earlier terminated by the Board.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023\n, the Company executed multiple trades to repurchase\n349,519\ncommon shares under the Repurchase Program for a total of\n$\n20.0\nmillion\nat a weighted average price of $\n57.22\nper share.  All repurchased shares were retired on the respective settlement dates.  At\nDecember 31, 2023\n, $\n230.0\nmillion remained available under this Repurchase Program.\nPreferred Units of the Operating Partnership\nThe number of Series A Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units, respectively, issued by RCLP is equal to the number of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, respectively, issued by the Company.\nCommon Units of the Operating Partnership\nCommon Units are issued, or redeemed and retired, for each share of Parent Company stock issued or redeemed, or retired, as described above.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Operating Partnership issued\n520,589\nexchangeable operating partnership units, valued at\n$\n31.3\nmillion, as partial purchase price consideration for the acquisition of\ntwo\nproperties.  In addition,\n3,340\nPartnership Units were converted to Parent Company common stock, and\n151,228\nPartnership Units were converted to $\n9.2\nmillion in cash at the Parent Company's election.\nGeneral Partners\nThe Parent Company, as general partner, owned the following Partnership Units outstanding:\n110\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n13.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation in General and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, the components of which are further described below:\n(1)\nIncludes amortization of the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards over the respective vesting periods\n.\nThe Company established its Omnibus Incentive Plan (the \"Plan\") under which the Board of Directors may grant stock options and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, and other key employees.  The Plan allows the Company to issue up\nto\n5.0\nmillion shares in the form of the Parent Company's common stock or stock options.  As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there were\n4.1\nmillion shares available for grant under the Plan.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nThe Company grants restricted stock under the Plan to its employees as a form of long-term compensation and retention.  The terms of each restricted stock grant vary depending upon the participant's responsibilities and position within the Company.  The Company's stock grants can be categorized as either time-based awards, performance-based awards, or market-based awards.  All awards are valued at fair value, earn dividends throughout the vesting period, and have no voting rights.  Fair value is measured using the grant date market price for all time-based or performance-based awards.  Market based awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value based on the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the projected stock price at the time of payout, discounted to the valuation date over a three year performance period.  Assumptions include historic volatility over the previous three year period, risk-free interest rates, and Regency's historic daily return as compared to the market index.  Since the award payout includes dividend equivalents and the total shareholder return includes the value of dividends, no dividend yield assumption is required for the valuation.  Compensation expense is measured at the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for the entire award.\n111\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\nThe following table summarizes non-vested restricted stock activity:\n(1)\nTime-based awards vest beginning on the first anniversary following the grant date over a one or four year service period\n.  These grants are subject only to continued employment and are not dependent on future performance measures.  Accordingly, if such vesting criteria are not met, compensation cost previously recognized would be reversed.\n(2)\nPerformance-based awards are earned subject to future performance measurements.  Once the performance criteria are achieved and the actual number of shares earned is determined, shares vest over a required service period.  The Company considers the likelihood of meeting the performance criteria based upon management's estimates from which it determines the amounts recognized as expense on a periodic basis.\n(3)\nMarket-based awards are earned dependent upon the Company's total shareholder return in relation to the shareholder return of a NAREIT index over a three-year period.  Once the performance criteria are met and the actual number of shares earned is determined, the shares are immediately vested and distributed.  The probability of meeting the criteria is considered when calculating the estimated fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation.  These awards are accounted for as awards with market criteria, with compensation cost recognized over the service period, regardless of whether the performance criteria are achieved and the awards are ultimately earned.  The significant assumptions underlying determination of fair values for market-based awards granted were as follows:\n(4)\nThe weighted-average grant price for restricted stock granted during the years is summarized below:\n(5)\nThe total intrinsic value of restricted stock vested during the years is summarized below (in thousands):\n(6)\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2023, there\nwas $\n20.3\nmillion of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock granted under the Parent Company's Plan\n.  When recognized, this compensation results in additional paid in capital in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Equity of the Parent Company and in general partner preferred and common units in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Capital of the Operating Partnership.  This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the next\nthree years\n.  The Company issues new restricted stock from its authorized shares available at the date of grant.\n112\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n14.\nSaving and Retirement Plans\n401(k) Retirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees and permits participants to defer eligible compensation up to the maximum allowable amount determined by the IRS.
