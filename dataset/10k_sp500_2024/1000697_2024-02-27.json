    "text": "General\nWaters Corporation (the “Company,” “Waters,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), a global leader in analytical instruments and software, has pioneered innovations in chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis serving life, materials and food sciences for more than 65 years. With approximately 7,900 employees worldwide, Waters operates directly in over 35 countries and has products available in more than 100 countries. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together\n(“LC-MS”)\nand sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA Instruments\nTM\n(“TA”) product line. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments.\nThe Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, clinical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers working in research and development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing.\nLC-MS\ninstruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. The Company’s thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research.\nWaters Corporation, organized as a Delaware corporation in 1991, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating subsidiary. Waters Corporation became a publicly traded company with its initial public offering (“IPO”) in November 1995. Since the IPO, the Company has added three significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996, Micromass Limited in September 1997 and Wyatt Technology in May 2023. On May 16, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Wyatt Technology, LLC and its three operating subsidiaries, Wyatt Technology Europe GmbH, Wyatt Technology France and Wyatt Technology UK Ltd. (collectively, “Wyatt”), for a total purchase price of $1.3 billion in cash. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories and services. The acquisition will expand Waters\nTM\nportfolio and increase exposure to large molecule applications.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company’s business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters and TA. The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instrument systems, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution;\n1\nand regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Operations of the recently acquired Wyatt business are part of the Waters operating segment.\nInformation concerning revenues and long-lived assets attributable to each of the Company’s products, services and geographic areas is set forth in Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nWaters Products and Markets\nHigh-Performance and Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography\nHPLC is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes that HPLC’s performance capabilities enable it to separate, identify and quantify a high proportion of all known chemicals. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes, quality control and process engineering applications.\nThe most significant\nend-use\nmarkets for HPLC are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these markets, HPLC is used extensively to understand diseases, identify new drugs, develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations and the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as chemical and consumer products. Waters also has in vitro diagnostic labelled products that are used as general-purpose instruments for clinical diagnostic applications, such as newborn screening and therapeutic drug management, in countries where these products are registered. HPLC is also used by universities, research institutions and governmental agencies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and their foreign counterparts that mandate safety and efficacy testing.\nIn 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company describes as ultra-performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY\nTM\nUPLC\nTM\nSystem, to accommodate the increased pressure and narrower chromatographic bands that are generated by these small and tightly packed particles. By using the ACQUITY UPLC System, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses previously performed by HPLC. In addition, in using the ACQUITY UPLC System, researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information. While offering significant performance advantages, the ACQUITY UPLC System is also compatible with the Company’s software products and the general operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the Company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this innovative technology and instrument. In 2018, the Company introduced the ACQUITY Arc\nTM\nBio System, a versatile,\niron-free, bio-inert, quaternary\nliquid chromatograph specifically engineered to improve bioseparation analytical methods. The Company also introduced the ACQUITY UPLC PLUS System series in 2018, consisting of the ACQUITY\nUPLC H-Class\nPLUS System, ACQUITY UPLC\nH-Class PLUS\nBio System and ACQUITY UPLC\nI-Class PLUS\nSystems, which incorporate foundational enhancements into the legacy systems.\nWaters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation, from component configured systems for academic teaching and research applications to fully automated systems for regulated and high sample throughput testing, and that have a variety of detection technologies, from optical-based ultra-violet absorbance, refractive index and fluorescence detectors to a suite of\nMS-based\ndetectors, optimized for certain analyses.\n2\nIn 2019, the Company introduced the ACQUITY Advanced Polymer Chromatography\nTM\nSystem, which is the first fully solvent-compatible UPLC System to perform size exclusion, gradient polymer elution and solvent compatible reversed-phase liquid chromatographic separations on a single platform. The\nall-in-one\nsystem gives research scientists greater analytical versatility and speed when conducting research on next-generation polymers. In 2020, the Company introduced the Waters Arc HPLC System, a new HPLC system for routine testing in the pharmaceutical, food, academic and materials markets. A key target application is quality control in laboratories performing batch release tests on small molecule pharmaceuticals. In 2021, the Company introduced the new ACQUITY Premier LC solution and the Arc Premier System both featuring Waters MaxPeak\nTM\nHigh Performance Surface (“HPS”) Technology. MaxPeak HPS Technology, which was first introduced with the Company’s introduction of ACQUITY\nPremier Columns in 2020, is a surface technology that forms a barrier between the sample and the metal surfaces of both the system and column, eliminating the need for system passivation, mitigating the loss of metal-sensitive analytes and yielding higher quality data in less time and effort.\nDuring the second half of 2023, Waters introduced the DynaPro\nTM\nZetaStar\nTM\ninstrument through its Wyatt Technology\nTM\nportfolio for nanoparticle analysis. The new instrument simultaneously enables dynamic and static light scattering and dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering measurements, all in one device. By combining multiple light scattering techniques and automatically assessing data quality and performing adaptive data capture, the ZetaStar instrument delivers both increased sensitivity and faster measurements to aid the precise development of complex biologics, using extremely low sample volumes.\nThe primary consumable products for LC instruments are chromatography columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in the LC testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals. The chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from silica or polymeric resins. As a pressurized sample is introduced to the column inlet and permeates through the packed column, it is separated into its constituent components.\nWaters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and competitors’ LC systems. The Company believes that it is one of a few suppliers in the world that manufactures silica and polymeric resins, packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories and can react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company believes that its ACQUITY UPLC Columns are used primarily on its ACQUITY UPLC Systems and, furthermore, that its ACQUITY UPLC Systems primarily use ACQUITY UPLC Columns. In 2019, the Company introduced the BioResolve\nTM\nSCX mAb Columns and VanGuard\nTM\nFIT Cartridge technologies. These new cation exchange column lines with specialized consumables are designed to simplify and improve the characterization and monitoring of monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) therapeutics, as well as enable mAb charge-variant analyses as required by the World Health Organization, the FDA and the International Conference on Harmonization for confirming the efficacy and safety of biologics and biosimilars with discovery, development and manufacturing applications. In 2020, Waters introduced ACQUITY Premier Columns, at the time a new family of premium\nsub-2-micron\ncolumns featuring MaxPeak HPS Technology. The columns are for use with any brand of UPLC System and can measurably improve data quality by mitigating the loss of sample analytes due to\nanalyte-to-surface\ninteractions.\nThe Company’s precision chemistry consumable products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products, including Certified Reference Materials and Proficiency Testing products. Laboratories around the world and across multiple industries use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis.\nIn 2023, the Company introduced the first in a new line of size exclusion chromatography columns aimed at improving analysis while lowering the cost of gene therapies, specifically adeno-associated viral (“AAV”) vectors. The new Waters XBridge\nTM\nPremier GTx BEH\nTM\nsize exclusion chromatography columns double the\n3\nspeed of measuring the potency and safety of AAVs. Combining the columns with light scattering technologies from its Wyatt Technology portfolio deepens the level of information acquired from a single experiment and optimizes the manufacturing of these novel gene delivery vehicles.\nIn 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Andrew Alliance, S.A. (“Andrew Alliance”). Andrew Alliance offers lab workflow automation solutions with the combination of its software platform and smart, connected laboratory equipment and accessories. The addition of Andrew Alliance to our portfolio has allowed us to positively impact our customers’ workflows by improving the repeatability, performance and speed of laboratory operations and chemistry workflows.\nIn 2023, the Company introduced the Alliance\nTM\niS HPLC System, the next-generation intelligent HPLC System, designed to reduce compliance risk by adding new levels of proactive error detection, troubleshooting and\nease-of-use.\nWhen combined with Waters compliance-ready Empower\nTM\nChromatography Software and eConnect\nTM\nHPLC Columns, the Alliance iS HPLC System streamlines the task of making accurate and precise measurements by detecting and eliminating common errors. In doing so, the Alliance iS HPLC System helps quality control laboratories to consistently meet quality, safety, compliance and\non-time\nproduct delivery goals. This system also integrates with the cloud-native waters_connect\nTM\nSystem Monitoring Software enabling real-time monitoring of the Alliance iS HPLC System and any other chromatography instruments controlled by Empower Software. Laboratory managers can view the live status of their HPLC instrument fleet from anywhere and at any time to further improve equipment utilization and overall productivity.\nAlso in 2023, the Company introduced the new bioprocess\nwalk-up\nsolutions designed to further simplify biologic sample preparation and analysis. This solution eliminated the need to send bioreactor samples to a central laboratory for analysis making it even easier to accelerate upstream bioprocess development by up to six weeks over traditional methods.\nMass Spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry\nMS is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of molecules that have been converted into ions.\nThe Company is a technology and market leader in the development, manufacture, sale and service of MS instruments and components. These instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems, such as LC, chemical electrophoresis and gas chromatography. A wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of MS instrumentation, including devices that incorporate quadrupole, ion trap,\ntime-of-flight\n(“Tof”), magnetic sector and ion mobility technologies. Furthermore, these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the speed and/or efficacy of certain experiments.\nCurrently, the Company offers a wide range of MS instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof and ion mobility designs. These instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development, as well as for environmental, clinical and nutritional safety testing. The overwhelming majority of mass spectrometers sold by the Company are designed to utilize an LC system and a liquid compatible interface (such as an electrospray ionization source) as the sample introduction device. These products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the pharmaceutical, biomedical, clinical, food and beverage and environmental market segments worldwide.\nMS is an increasingly important detection technology for LC. The Company’s\nsmaller-sized\nmass spectrometers, such as the single quadrupole detector and the tandem quadrupole detector (“TQD”), are often referred to as LC “detectors” and are typically sold as part of an LC system or as an LC system upgrade. Larger quadrupole systems, such as the Xevo\nTM\nTQ MS System and Xevo\nTQ-S\nMS System, are used primarily for experiments performed for late-stage drug development, including clinical trial testing. Quadrupole\ntime-of-flight\n4\n(“Q-Tof”)\ninstruments, such as the Company’s SYNAPT\nTM\nG2-S\nHDMS System, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes, an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics.”\nLC and MS are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general-purpose analytical device. An increasing percentage of the Company’s customers are purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it has become common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user. The descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly in today’s instrument market, this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS technologies as part of a single device. In response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters operating segment to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated\nLC-MS\nsystems.\nIn 2019, the Company introduced the BioAccord\nTM\nSystem, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry solution that expands access to high-resolution\ntime-of-flight\nmass spectrometry capabilities. The system provides new levels of user experience with automated setup and self-diagnosis delivered through an intuitive user interface. Also in 2019, the Company introduced the SELECT SERIES\nTM\nCyclic\nTM\nIMS System, which seamlessly integrates cyclic ion mobility technology into a high-performance research-grade\ntime-of-flight\nmass spectrometer. In addition, the Company introduced the SYNAPT XS System, a new highly flexible, high-resolution mass spectrometer for research and development labs focused on discovery applications. The Company also reinforced its tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry portfolio during the current year with upgrades to the Xevo\nTQ-S\nmicro MS System and the introduction of the new Xevo\nTQ-S\ncronos MS System. The Xevo\nTQ-S\nmicro System features new performance enhancements that bring the quantitation of highly polar, ionic compounds in food to a higher level. The Xevo\nTQ-S\ncronos System is a new, tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer purposely built for routine quantitation of large numbers of small-molecule organic compounds over a wide concentration range. The Xevo\nTQ-S\nmicro System and the Xevo\nTQ-S\ncronos System are also well suited to meet regulatory requirements for pesticide residue analysis, the monitoring for contaminants in processed foods, identifying drugs of abuse, and performing impurity profiling of pharmaceuticals. In 2020, the Company introduced the RADIAN\nTM\nASAP\nTM\nSystem, a novel direct mass detector engineered for\nnon-mass\nspectrometry experts to conduct fast and accurate analyses of solids and liquids with minimal sample prep. Also in 2020, the Company introduced enhancements for the Waters Xevo\nG2-XS\nQTof System, SYNAPT XS System and SELECT SERIES Cyclic IMS System, including a new fragmentation technique and imaging option.\nIn 2021, the Company introduced the SELECT SERIES MRT MS System, a high-resolution mass spectrometer that combines Multi-Reflecting\nTime-of-Flight\n(“MRT”) technology with enhanced desorption electrospray ionization and new matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging sources. The platform will serve as the basis for Waters next generation Tof instruments with applications in pharmaceutical, biomedical, natural products, and materials research. Also in 2021, the Company released the ACQUITY RDa\nTM\nDetector featuring SmartMS\nTM\nTechnology, the company’s newest Tof MS designed to improve the ease and reliability of small molecule analysis for pharmaceutical, academic, food, and forensic applications. The Company also introduced a new peptide multi-attribute method workflow for the BioAccord\nLC-MS\nSystem in 2021, which is an\nend-to-end\nworkflow for analyzing monoclonal antibodies and other protein and peptide-based drugs.\nIn 2022, the Company introduced the Xevo TQ Absolute System, the most sensitive and compact benchtop tandem mass spec in its class. The Company introduced the new Xevo G3\nQ-Tof\nMass Spectrometer with CONFIRM Sequence, a new oligonucleotide sequencing confirmation app for the waters_connect Software platform and an electrospray ionization source for the high-resolution SELECT SERIES MRT Mass Spectrometer.\n5\nBased upon 2023 reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of LC and\nLC-MS\ninstrument systems, chromatography columns and other consumables and related services.\nThe Company has been a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with both the Company’s and other suppliers’ instruments. The Company’s newest software technology for mass spectrometry is the waters_connect Software platform. In 2019, the Company introduced the first of a series of applications on this platform supporting the BioAccord System and the Xevo G2 XS Mass Spectrometer. These applications support biopharmaceutical workflows, simplifying the collection of often complex LCMS data for use in biopharmaceutical development and into QC where it is used to assure the quality of existing medicines and new drug formulations. The platform design of waters_connect Software has enabled rapid delivery of several major updates including new biopharma application workflows designed in close collaboration with biopharmaceutical innovators to solve specific challenges they face with existing solutions. The platform also provides the foundation for the connected lab of the future where data is no longer siloed but can be securely shared among a community of connected scientists. The waters_connect Software joins the existing suite of informatics products: Empower Chromatography Data Software, MassLynx\nTM\nMass Spectrometry Software and NuGenesis\nTM\nScientific Data Management System, each of which is used to support innovations within world-leading institutions. In 2020, Waters announced the availability of Empower BC LAC/E\nTM\nSolution with SecureSync, an enhanced solution to preserve the ability for laboratories to work locally when organizations with distributed laboratory environments experience an enterprise interruption.\nOn December 15, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Integrated Software Solutions Pty Limited and its two operating subsidiaries Integrated Software Solutions Limited and Integrated Software Solutions USA, LLC (collectively, “ISS”). ISS offers clinical laboratory software systems that support and further expand product offerings within our clinical business. The net assets acquired primarily relate to ISS’ laboratory information system,\nOMNI-Lab.\nIn 2022, the Company introduced a new\nPer-and\nPolyfluoroalkyl Substances (“PFAS”) quantitation workflow enabled by enhancements to its waters_connect Software for quantitation software and the Company introduced Extraction+\nTM\nConnected Device, a new software-controlled product for the Waters Andrew+\nTM\nPipetting Robot that automates the preparation of biological, food, forensics and environmental samples by solid phase extraction.\nIn 2023, the Company introduced the next generation Xevo TQ Absolute IVD Mass Spectrometer, expanding its family of MassTrak\nTM\nIVD\nLC-MS/MS\nSystems for clinical diagnostic applications. The powerful analytical performance of the Xevo TQ Absolute IVD Mass Spectrometer is up to five times more sensitive for quantifying clinical analytes. This sensitivity enables clinical laboratories to detect and measure trace level analytes within a sample at lower detection levels than previously possible. It can also extend the testing capabilities of the clinical laboratory to include lower volume samples obtained in less-invasive assays such as saliva, breath, dried blood spots and multiplex panels and large molecules. The new MassTrak\nLC-MS/MS\nIVD System includes the ACQUITY UPLC\nI-Class\nPLUS System with the Xevo TQ Absolute IVD Mass Spectrometer. The ACQUITY UPLC\nI-Class\nPLUS System is designed to deliver rapid and accurate sample analysis to enhance the sensitivity of any mass spectrometer and simplify the characterization of the most complex sample. The Xevo TQ Absolute IVD System provides more consistent\ninstrument-to-instrument\nperformance, with a user-friendly design that maximizes service uptime. Its innovative design is also 45% smaller and uses 50% less nitrogen gas and electricity than comparable tandem quadrupole-mass spectrometry systems, making it ideal for hospital labs and independent commercial labs with both sustainability and business growth goals to meet.\nIn addition, in 2023, the Company introduced the industry’s first targeted imaging mass spectrometer based on its Xevo TQ Absolute Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer which is the most sensitive and compact mass spectrometer in its class. The new instrument combines the Waters DESI XS source with the Xevo TQ Absolute\n6\nSystem and is five times more sensitive and five times faster than discovery-based imaging systems at precisely determining whether a particular small molecule drug product, and how much of it, reaches its intended target, such as a brain, liver or lung, in a test subject.\nAlso in 2023, the Company announced new updates to its SELECT SERIES MRT System that increases its specificity and utility for\nUPLC-MS/MS\nmetabolomics and drug discovery applications and for mass spectrometry imaging experiments. The MRT System now offers 50% higher resolution, making it capable of 300,000 FWHM resolution, a 3X faster scan rate and\nparts-per-billion\nmass accuracy. These MRT System enhancements are designed to help research scientists unambiguously identify analytes of interest in samples of blood, urine and tissue, contributing to a greater understanding of molecules and their mechanisms of action in numerous scientific fields. It is compatible with numerous MS imaging sources including DESI and MALDI, and generates crystal-clear, high-resolution images without compromising mass spectral resolution or accuracy.\nIn addition, in 2023, the Company combined its BioAccord\nLC-MS\nSystem and the Waters Andrew+ Pipetting Robot, connecting via new protocols in OneLab\nTM\nSoftware to create fully integrated and\neasy-to-use\nbioprocess\nwalk-up\nsolutions. It is designed to enable less experienced\nLC-MS\nusers to acquire critical quality attribute data for analysis of drug product and cell culture media. Capturing data directly at the bioproduction laboratory can help bioprocess engineers improve process understanding, leading to more robust manufacturing processes and accelerated development timelines.\nWaters Service\nServices provided by Waters enable customers to maximize technology productivity, support customer compliance activities and provide transparency into enterprise resource management efficiencies. The customer benefits from improved budget control, data-driven technology adoption and accelerated workflow at a site or on a global perspective. The Company considers its service offerings to be highly differentiated from its competition, as evidenced by a consistent increase in annual service revenues. The Company’s principal competitors in the service market include Revvity, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. These competitors can provide certain services on Waters instruments to varying degrees and always present competitive risk.\nThe servicing and support of instruments, software and accessories is an important source of revenue and represented over 35% of sales for Waters in 2023. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans, demand services, spare parts, customer performance validation services and customer training. Support plans typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to promptly repair a\nnon-functioning\ninstrument in return for a fee described in a contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument.\nThe waters_connect System Monitoring is a new\nSoftware-as-a-Service\napplication that enables laboratory managers and analysts to monitor the real-time status of any chromatography instruments, regardless of the manufacturer, running on Waters Empower Software. The waters_connect System Monitoring application was developed especially for high-volume quality assurance/quality control laboratories. It can reduce the turnaround time of product release samples and facilitate the planning and progress of critical analyses via live,\nat-a-glance\ndashboard views of the operational status of chromatography instruments. The cloud-native application also helps lab managers utilize capital resources better by providing an understanding of instrument history and usage levels and improve the productivity of their teams.\nTA Products and Markets\nThermal Analysis, Rheometry and Calorimetry\nThermal analysis measures the physical or thermodynamic characteristics of materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials, such as their heat flow\n7\ncharacteristics, physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal analysis techniques, including calorimetry. Consequently, thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development, production and characterization of materials in various industries, such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and electronics.\nRheometry instruments often complement thermal analyzers in characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity and deformation under different types of “loading” or other conditions. The information obtained under such conditions provides insight into a material’s behavior during processing, packaging, transport, usage and storage.\nThermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are heavily used in material testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide information useful in predicting the suitability and stability of industrial polymers, fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. As with systems offered by Waters, a range of instrument configurations is available with increasing levels of sample handling and information processing automation. In addition, systems and accompanying software packages can be tailored for specific applications.\nIn 2020, TA introduced the new Discovery\nTM\nX3\nTM\nDifferential Scanning Calorimeter (“X3 DSC”), Discovery Hybrid Rheometers and TAM IV Micro XL isothermal microcalorimeter. The X3 DSC accelerates productivity in customers’ laboratories by enabling three samples to be measured in a single experiment, compared to the single-sample series operation of the other available DSC offerings in the market. This particularly addresses a need in high-throughput laboratories in industries such as composites, electronics and polymer manufacturing. The new line of Discovery Hybrid Rheometers provides increased sensitivity and versatility of rheometry measurements, supporting the development of next-generation, high-performance materials by improving the productivity and efficiency of materials science research. The TAM IV Micro XL isothermal calorimeter supports the development of new battery chemistries by measuring self-discharge and unwanted reactions that reduce battery life and efficiency.\nIn 2021, TA introduced the TMA 450 RH Instrument and the Discovery SA Instrument. The TMA 450 RH Instrument provides measurements of dimensional compatibility of materials under controlled temperature and humidity that are important for the development of new electronic devices. The Discovery SA Instrument is used in pharmaceutical development to assess the impact of moisture in drug product processing and storage on crystalline structure, which is related to drug product efficacy.\nIn 2021, TA introduced the TRIOS\nTM\nAutoPilot Software for its thermal analyzer product line. This software helps laboratory staff using TA’s thermal analyzers create routine and streamlined standard operating procedures improving the speed and productivity of thermal analysis measurements.\nIn 2022, TA introduced the Powder Rheology Accessory, which enables our Discovery Hybrid Rheometers to characterize the behavior of powders during storage, dispensing, processing and\nend-use.\nThe Powder Rheology Accessory provides relevant property and processing measurements for battery electrode coatings to prevent defects that cause cell failure and pharmaceutical tablets to prevent instabilities of API blends.\nIn 2022, TA introduced Polymer Workflow Guided Methods, which provides walk up and use functionality by codifying polymer workflows. Guided Methods leverages the power of TRIOS AutoPilot Software and enables novice users to quickly learn and use the instrument to set up test methods, run tests, and execute analyses across our Thermal Analysis and Rheology product lines.\nIn 2023, TA introduced a new Battery Cycler Microcalorimeter Solution for high-resolution characterization of battery cells. The instrument and software combination enables\nnon-destructive\ntesting under real-world operating conditions and significantly reduces experiment time from months to weeks, while providing decisive insights for greater battery efficiency, safety and stability.\n8\nTA Service\nSimilar to Waters, the servicing and support of TA’s instruments is an important source of revenue and represented more than 25% of sales for TA in 2023. TA operates independently from the Waters operating segment, though many of its overseas offices are jointly occupied with Waters to achieve operational efficiencies. TA has dedicated field sales and service operations. Service sales are primarily derived from the sale of support plans, replacement parts and billed labor fees associated with the repair, maintenance and upgrade of installed systems.\nGlobal Customers\nThe Company typically has a broad and diversified customer base that includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts, universities and governmental agencies. Purchase of the Company’s instrument systems is often dependent on its customers’ capital spending, or funding as in the cases of academic, governmental and research institutions, which often fluctuate from year to year. The pharmaceutical segment represents the Company’s largest sector and includes multinational pharmaceutical companies, generic drug manufacturers, contract research organizations (“CROs”) and biotechnology companies. The Company’s other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers, polymer manufacturers, food and beverage companies and environmental testing laboratories. The Company also sells to universities and governmental agencies worldwide. The Company’s technical sales and support staff members work closely with its customers in developing and implementing applications that meet their full range of analytical requirements. During 2023, 57% of the Company’s net sales were to pharmaceutical accounts, 31% to other industrial accounts and 12% to academic institutions and governmental agencies. Although the Company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.\nThe Company typically experiences seasonality in its orders that is reflected as an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of many customers who tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar\nyear-end.\nThe Company does not rely on any single customer for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of the Company’s net sales.\nSales and Service\nThe Company has one of the largest direct sales and service organizations focused exclusively on the analytical workflows offered by the Company. Across these product technologies, using respective specialized sales and service workforces, the Company serves its customer base with 85 sales offices throughout the world as of December 31, 2023 and approximately 4,300, 4,500 and 4,300 field representatives in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This investment in sales and service personnel serves to maintain and expand the Company’s installed base of instruments. The Company’s sales representatives have direct responsibility for account relationships, while service representatives work in the field to install instruments, train customers and minimize instrument downtime.\nIn-house\nand field-based technical support representatives work directly with customers, providing them assistance with applications and procedures on Company products. The Company provides customers with comprehensive information through various corporate and geographic-specific internet websites and product literature, and also makes consumable products available through electronic ordering facilities and a dedicated catalog.\nManufacturing and Distribution\nThe Company provides high product quality by overseeing each stage of the production of its instruments, columns and chemical reagents.\n9\nThe Company currently assembles a portion of its LC instruments at its facility in Milford, Massachusetts, where it performs machining, assembly and testing. The Milford facility maintains quality management and environmental management systems in accordance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2015, ISO 13485:2016, ISO 45001:2018 and ISO 14001:2015, and adheres to applicable regulatory requirements (including the FDA Quality System Regulation and the European\nIn-Vitro\nDiagnostic Directive). The Company outsources manufacturing of certain electronic components, such as computers, monitors and circuit boards, to outside vendors that meet the Company’s quality requirements. In addition, the Company outsources the manufacturing of certain LC instrument systems and components to well-established contract manufacturing firms in Singapore. The Company’s Singapore entity is ISO 9001:2015 certified and manages all Asian outsourced manufacturing as well as the distribution of all products from Asia. The Company may pursue outsourcing opportunities as they arise but believes it maintains adequate supply chain and manufacturing capabilities in the event of disruption or natural disasters.\nThe Company primarily manufactures and distributes its LC columns at its facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its Taunton location. The Company has incurred costs of approximately $248 million on a new\nstate-of-the-art\nfacility, which is substantially complete as of December 31, 2023. The Taunton facility processes, sizes and treats silica and polymeric media that are packed into columns, solid phase extraction cartridges and bulk shipping containers in both Taunton and Wexford. The Wexford facility also manufactures and distributes certain data, instruments and software components for the Company’s LC, MS and TA product lines. The Company’s Taunton facility is certified to ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015. The Wexford facility is certified to ISO 9001:2015, ISO 13485:2016/EN ISO 13485:2016 and ISO 14001:2015. VICAM manufactures antibody-linked resins and magnetic beads that are packed into columns and kits in Milford, Massachusetts and Nixa, Missouri. The Company manufactures and distributes its Analytical Standards and Reagents and Environmental Resource Associates (“ERA”) product lines at its facility in Golden, Colorado, which is certified to ISO 9001:2015 and accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2017, ISO/IEC 17034:16, ISO/IEC 17043:2010 and TNI Standard Vol. 3:2016. Some ERA products are also manufactured in the Wexford, Ireland facility, which is also accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2017 and ISO/IEC 17034:2016.\nThe Company manufactures and distributes its MS products at its facilities in Wilmslow, England and Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the Company’s MS instruments are manufactured at its facility in Solihull, England and by long-standing outside contractors. Each stage of this supply chain is closely monitored by the Company to maintain high quality and performance standards. The instruments, components or modules are then returned to the Company’s facilities, where its engineers perform final assembly, calibrations to customer specifications and quality control procedures. The Company’s MS facilities are certified to ISO 9001:2015, ISO 13485:2016/EN ISO 13485:2016 and ISO 14001:2015 (Wexford only) and adhere to applicable regulatory requirements (including the FDA Quality System Regulation and the European\nIn-Vitro\nDiagnostic Directive).\nTA’s thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry products are manufactured and distributed at the Company’s New Castle, Delaware, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, Lindon, Utah and Hüllhorst, Germany facilities. Similar to MS, elements of TA’s products are manufactured by outside contractors and are then returned to the Company’s facilities for final assembly, calibration and quality control. The Company’s New Castle facility is certified to the ISO 9001:2015 standard and the Eden Prairie facility is certified to both ISO 9001:2015 and ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standards, and the Lindon facility is certified to ISO 9001:2015.\nAll instrument manufacturing for Wyatt products takes place at its facilities in Santa Barbara, California. The Company’s Wyatt facility in Santa Barbara, California is certified to ISO 9001:2015\nRaw Materials\nThe Company purchases a variety of raw materials, primarily consisting of high temperature alloy sheet metal and castings, forgings,\npre-plated\nmetals and electrical components from various vendors. The materials used by\n10\nthe Company’s operations are generally available from a number of sources and in sufficient quantities to meet current requirements subject to normal lead times.\nThe Company is subject to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which require disclosure as to whether certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which may be contained in the Company’s products, are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. In 2022, the Company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products. However, the Company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The Company is in the process of evaluating its 2023 supply chain, and the Company plans to file its 2023 Form SD with the SEC in May 2024. The results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the Company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products.\nIn addition, the Company continues to monitor environmental, health and safety regulations in countries in which it operates throughout the world, in particular, European Union and China Restrictions on the use of certain Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment and European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. Further information regarding these regulations is available on the Company’s website, www.waters.com, under the caption “About Waters / Corporate Governance”.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company maintains an active research and development program focused on the development and commercialization of products that extend, complement and update its existing product offering. The Company’s research and development expenditures for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $175 million, $176 million and $168 million, respectively.\nNearly all of the Company’s LC products have been developed at the Company’s main research and development center located in Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the Company’s extensive field organizations and customers. The majority of the Company’s MS products are developed at facilities in England and most of the Company’s current materials characterization products are developed at the Company’s research and development center in New Castle, Delaware. At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were approximately 1,200 employees involved in the Company’s research and development efforts. The Company has increased research and development expenses from its continued commitment to invest significantly in new product development and existing product enhancements, and as a result of acquisitions. Despite the Company’s active research and development programs, there can be no assurance that the Company’s product development and commercialization efforts will be successful or that the products developed by the Company will be accepted by the marketplace.\nIn 2020, the Company opened a new research laboratory in Cambridge, MA, which serves as a strategic, collaborative space in the community, where Waters can partner with academia, research and industry to accelerate the next generation of scientific advancements.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that our people differentiate our business and are vital to our continued success. As a result, we have made important investments in our workforce through initiatives and programs that support talent development and inclusion and enhance our Total Rewards programs.\nEmployees\nThe Company employed approximately 7,900, 8,200 and 7,800 employees at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with approximately 38% of the Company’s employees located in the United States. The\n11\nCompany believes its employee relations are generally good. The Company’s employees are not unionized or affiliated with any internal or external labor organizations.\nIn July 2023, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction that impacted approximately 5% of the Company’s employees.\nTalent Development\nWe believe that our future success depends in a significant part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees and then contribute to the growth and development of these employees.\nWe further the growth and development of our employees by investing in various programs, digital platforms and workshops that build professional and technical skills. In addition, management periodically assesses succession planning for certain key positions and reviews our workforce to identify high potential employees for future growth and development.\nInclusion & Diversity\nWe believe inclusion is a core tenet of organizational success and that fostering a sense of inclusivity allows our employees to maximize their performance contribution to our business. In 2021, we hired our first Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to help strategize and focus our inclusivity efforts. As part of our\ncompany-led\ninitiatives to drive an inclusive workplace, we have created Employee Circles and Employee Hubs, which are voluntary, employee-driven employee resource groups worldwide to foster a diverse and inclusive culture through awareness, education and employee connections. Our five Employee Circles are people of color, LGBTQ+ pride, veterans, women and disability. Our global Employee Circles provide opportunities for Waters employees to connect with teammates throughout the world, while Employee Hubs encourage engagement at the local level. Our Employee Circles and Hubs led various initiatives in 2023 to build a strong culture of inclusion and awareness. We have also rolled out training to all employees to support an inclusive culture that values diverse perspectives.\nWe believe that part of fostering a diverse, inclusive and equitable organization and workforce means understanding the makeup of our current employees. As of December 31, 2023, our workforce identifies as:\nRecruitment\nWaters has focused on expanding diversity in our recruitment processes, including developing partnerships with organizations that support diversity in hiring and employee engagement. Current partnerships include: the National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers, Out in Tech, Vercida, Home Base and Fairygodboss to expand the pipeline of strong candidates.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. Through online and\nin-person\ntraining programs, we believe that we foster a safe workplace and ensure that all employees are empowered to prevent accidents and injuries.\n12\nWe manufacture products deemed essential to critical infrastructure, including health and safety, food and agriculture, and energy, and as a result, the majority of our production sites continued operating during the\nCOVID-19\npandemic.\nCompetition\nThe analytical instrument systems, supplies and services market is highly competitive. The Company encounters competition from several worldwide suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets for each of its three primary technologies. The Company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of product performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser extent, price. Competitors continuously introduce new products and have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company’s business. Some competitors have greater financial resources and broader distribution than the Company’s.\nIn the markets served by Waters, the Company’s principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Bruker Corporation, Danaher Corporation and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. In the markets served by TA, the Company’s principal competitors include: Perkin Elmer, Inc., NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern PANalytical Ltd., a subsidiary of Spectris plc, Anton-Paar GmbH and others not identified here.\nThe market for consumable LC products, including separation columns, is highly competitive and generally more fragmented than the analytical instruments market. The Company encounters competition in the consumable columns market from chemical companies that produce column sorbents and small specialized companies that primarily pack purchased sorbents into columns and subsequently package and distribute columns. The Company believes that it is one of the few suppliers that processes silica and polymeric resins, packs columns and distributes its own products. The Company competes in this market on the basis of performance, reproducibility, reputation and, to a lesser extent, price. In recent years, the Company’s principal competitors for consumable products have included: Danaher Corporation; Merck KGaA; Agilent Technologies, Inc.; General Electric Company and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC Instrument is designed to offer a predictable level of performance when used with ACQUITY UPLC Columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the ACQUITY UPLC Instrument base will enhance its chromatographic column business because of the high level of synergy between ACQUITY UPLC Columns and the ACQUITY UPLC Instruments.\nPatents, Trademarks and Licenses\nThe Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents and has patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. Certain technology and software has been acquired or is licensed from third parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is, in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss would materially affect the Company’s business as a whole.\nEnvironmental Matters and Climate Change\nThe Company is subject to foreign and U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations and has operated its business in the past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. From time to time, Company operations have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its\n13\noperations, financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws.\nThe Company is sensitive to the growing global debate with respect to climate change. An internal sustainability working group develops increasingly robust data with respect to the Company’s utilization of carbon producing substances in an effort to continuously reduce the Company’s carbon footprint. In 2019, the Company published a sustainability report identifying the various actions and behaviors the Company adopted in 2018 concerning its commitment to both the environment and the broader topic of social responsibility. The Company has continued to publish a sustainability report (which was renamed the ESG Report in 2022) on an annual basis. In November 2023, the Company published its 2023 ESG Report, detailing the Company’s efforts to address its environmental impact and uphold its social responsibilities in 2023. See Item 1A, Risk Factors – The effects of climate change could harm the Company’s business, for more information on the potential significance of climate change legislation. See also Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about geographic areas.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company files or furnishes all required reports with the SEC.

    "text": "The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\nRISKS RELATED TO MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nThe Company’s international operations may be negatively affected by political events, wars or terrorism, economic conditions and regulatory changes, related to either a specific country or a larger region. These potential political, currency and economic disruptions, as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nApproximately 69% and 70% of the Company’s net sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively, were outside of the United States and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company has considerable manufacturing operations in Ireland and the U.K., as well as significant subcontractors located in Singapore. As a result, a significant portion of the Company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks, including adverse developments in the political, regulatory and economic environment, in particular, uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic trade policy; the effect of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of European countries; impact and costs of terrorism or war, in particular as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and the possibility of further escalation resulting in new geopolitical and regulatory instability; the instability and possible dissolution of the euro as a single currency; sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices; trade protection measures including embargoes, sanctions and tariffs; differing tax laws and changes in those laws; restrictions on investments and/or limitations regarding foreign ownership; nationalization of private enterprises which may result in the confiscation of assets; credit risk and uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; the impact of global health pandemics and epidemics, such as\nCOVID-19;\nchanges in inflation and interest rates; instability in the global banking industry; rising energy prices and potential energy shortages; difficulties in protecting intellectual property; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and associated adverse operational, contractual and tax consequences.\nIn 2023, the Company generated $441 million of total net sales from China, down from $565 million in 2022. This significant 22% reduction in sales from China resulted from lower customer demand for our products across all customer classes, driven by various factors. Such factors include a decline in the economic conditions in China, trade tensions and tariffs between the U.S. and China and their impact on our customers’ purchasing decisions, increased competition from local and international competitors in China, the Chinese government’s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers and other regulatory and compliance challenges and uncertainties in the Chinese market, all of which had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business and operations in China.\nIn particular, China’s government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing sector-specific policies, and it maintains control over China’s economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industries or companies. The U.S. government has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy with China and has recently raised, and has proposed to further raise in the future, tariffs on several Chinese goods. China has retaliated with increased tariffs on U.S. goods, which may increase our cost of doing business in China. Any further changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, including China, resulting in trade wars and increased costs for\n16\ngoods imported into the U.S. and impacting our ability to sell our products in China and other affected countries. Accordingly, our financial position or results of operations can be adversely influenced by political, economic, legal, compliance, social and business conditions in China generally.\nAdditionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses, interest, taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies, particularly the euro, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese renminbi, could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into certain foreign currency exchange contracts that are intended to offset some of the market risk associated with sales denominated in foreign currencies. We cannot predict the effectiveness of these transactions or their impact upon our future operating results, and from time to time they may negatively affect our quarterly earnings.\nGlobal economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the demand for, and supply of, the Company’s products and harm the Company’s financial results.\nThe Company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions such as changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies) and interest rates. Both our domestic and international markets experience varying degrees of inflationary and interest rate pressures. These changes in global economic conditions may affect the demand for, and supply of, the Company’s products and services. This may result in a decline in sales in the future, increased rate of order cancellations or delays, increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories, longer sales cycles and potential difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. There can be no assurance regarding demand for the Company’s products and services in the future.\nDisruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the Company’s access to capital and financial condition.\nFinancial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have experienced times of extreme disruption, including, among other things, sharp increases in the cost of new capital, credit rating downgrades and bailouts, severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets. Financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions, resulting in large asset write-downs, higher costs of capital, rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money. There can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions. Any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the Company participates may impair the Company’s ability to access its existing cash, utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions or access sources of new capital, which it may need to meet its capital needs. The cost to the Company of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur.\nPublic health crises, epidemics or pandemics, such as the\nCOVID-19\npandemic have had, and could in the future have, a negative impact on the Company’s business and operations.\nPublic health crises, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the future have, a negative impact on our business and operations, including Company sales and cash flow. Such public health crises, epidemics and pandemics have the potential to create significant volatility, uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption, resulting in an economic slowdown of potentially extended duration, as seen with the\nCOVID-19\npandemic from 2020 to 2022. The Company’s global operations expose it to risks associated with such public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, which could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The degree to which such public health crisis, epidemics or pandemics ultimately affects the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n17\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe Company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand, which may decrease for a number of reasons, many beyond the Company’s control.\nThe demand for the Company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its LC,\nLC-MS,\nlight scattering, thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry products; the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the Company’s customers; changes in governmental regulations, particularly those affecting drug, food and drinking water testing; funding available to academic, governmental and research institutions; general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the Company’s major markets; and competitive considerations. The Company typically experiences seasonality in its orders that is reflected as an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar\nyear-end.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that the Company will effectively forecast customer demand and appropriately allocate research and development expenditures to products with high growth and high margin prospects. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions.\nThe analytical instrument market may also, from time to time, experience low sales growth. Approximately 57% and 59% of the Company’s net sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively, were to worldwide pharmaceutical accounts, which are periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nCompetitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the Company’s, which could result in decreased sales. The competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidations among the Company’s competitors, which could harm the Company’s business.\nThe analytical instrument market, and, in particular, the portion related to the Company’s HPLC, UPLC,\nLC-MS,\nlight scattering, thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines, is highly competitive. The Company encounters competition from several international instrument suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets. Some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company’s business, but are typically less focused on the Company’s chosen markets. Over the years, some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons, including increasing product line offerings, improving market share and reducing costs. There can be no assurance that the Company’s competitors will not introduce new, disruptive technologies that displace the Company’s existing technologies or more effective and less costly products than those of the Company or that the Company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the Company’s competitors in the future.\nStrategies for organic growth require developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial results.\nThe Company’s corporate strategy is fundamentally based on winning through organic innovation and deep application expertise. The Company is in the process of developing new products with recently acquired technologies. The future development of these new products will require a significant amount of spending over the next few years before any significant, robust sales will be realized. Furthermore, these new products will be sold into both the\nnon-clinical\nand clinical markets, and any new products requiring FDA clearance may take longer to bring to market. There can be no assurance given as to the timing of these new product launches and the ultimate realization of sales and profitability in the future.\nIn addition, the Company’s products are subject to rapid changes in technology. Rapidly changing technology could make some or all of our product lines obsolete unless the Company is able to continually improve our existing products and develop new products. If the Company fails to develop and introduce products\n18\nin a timely manner in response to changing technology, market demands or the requirements of our customers, the Company’s product sales may decline, and we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company may face risks associated with previous or future acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures and divestitures.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures and divestitures. The Company may pursue transactions that complement or augment its existing products and services, such as the Wyatt acquisition that was completed in May 2023. Such transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations, technologies and products; diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; inability to predict financial results; potential departures of key employees of the acquired company; and difficulties in effectively transferring divested businesses and liabilities. If the Company successfully identifies acquisitions in the future, completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of the Company’s stock that may be dilutive to current owners; increases in the Company’s debt and contingent liabilities; and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets. For example, the Company financed the Wyatt acquisition, in part, through borrowings under its revolving credit facility, resulting in a significant increase in the Company’s outstanding debt. Acquired businesses may also expose the Company to new risks and new markets, and the Company may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost-effective and timely manner. Any of these transaction-related risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profitability. In addition, the Company may not be able to identify, successfully complete, or integrate potential acquisitions in the future. Even if the Company can do so, it cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on the Company’s business or operating results.\nThe Company’s software or hardware may contain coding or manufacturing errors that could impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences.\nDespite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, the detection and correction of any errors in released software or hardware can be time consuming and costly. This could delay the development or release of new products or services, or new versions of products or services, create security vulnerabilities in the Company’s products or services, and adversely affect market acceptance of products or services. If the Company experiences errors or delays in releasing its software or hardware, or new versions thereof, its sales could be affected and revenues could decline. Errors in software or hardware could expose the Company to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as harm to brand and reputation, which could impact future sales.\nA successful product liability claim brought against the Company in excess of, or outside the coverage of, the Company’s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, and insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nDisruption of operations at the Company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the Company’s financial condition.\nThe Company manufactures LC instruments at facilities in Milford, Massachusetts and through a subcontractor in Singapore; precision chemistry separation columns at its facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland; MS products at its facilities in Wilmslow, England, Solihull, England and Wexford, Ireland; thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in New Castle, Delaware; and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the Company’s acquisitions. Any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility, power interruptions, cybersecurity incidents, weather events or natural disasters (including the potential impacts of climate change) or other reasons, could harm our customer relationships, impede our ability to generate sales and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.\n19\nFailure to adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain, maintain, and enforce patents on our technology, maintain our trademarks, and protect our trade secrets. There can be no assurance that any patents held by the Company will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company. Additionally, there could be successful claims against the Company by third-party patent holders with respect to certain Company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against the Company, or third parties hold pending or issued patents that relate to the Company’s products or technology, the Company may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, the Company may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and the challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. The Company’s failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could impact the sale, manufacture, or distribution of its products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s patents, including those licensed from others, expire on various dates.\nThe Company also depends in part on its trademarks and the strength of its proprietary brands, which the Company considers important to its business. The Company’s inability to protect or preserve the value of its intellectual property rights for any reason, including the Company’s inability to successfully defend against counterfeit, knock-offs, grey-market, infringing or otherwise unauthorized products, could damage the Company’s brand and reputation and harm its business.\nThe Company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary\nknow-how\nwith which it seeks to protect its products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may not adequately protect the Company’s trade secrets and other proprietary rights. These agreements may be breached, and the Company may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, the Company’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by its competitors. If the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights, it could have an adverse and material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company’s business would suffer if the Company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply.\nMost of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by the Company are available from a number of different suppliers; however, a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply. Consolidation among such suppliers could also result in other limited or sole-source suppliers for the Company in the future. Disruption of these sources could have, at a minimum, a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the Company. In addition, price increases from these suppliers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s margins. A prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely affect the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s sales would deteriorate if the Company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules.\nCertain components or modules of the Company’s LC and MS instruments are manufactured by outside contractors, including the manufacturing of LC instrument systems and related components by contract manufacturing firms in Singapore. The ability of these contractors to perform their obligations is largely outside of the Company’s control. Failure by these outside contractors to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the Company. In addition, if one or more of such contractors experience significant disruption in services or institute a significant price increase, the Company may have to seek alternative providers, its costs could increase and the delivery of its products could be prevented or delayed. A prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.\n20\nThe Company’s business could be harmed by actions of third-party sales intermediaries and other third parties that sell our products.\nThe Company sells some products through third parties, including third-party sales intermediaries and value-added resellers. This exposes us to various risks, including competitive pressure, concentration of sales volumes, credit risks and compliance risks. We may rely on one or a few key third-party sales intermediaries for a product or market and the loss of these third-party sales intermediaries could reduce our revenue or net earnings. Third-party sales intermediaries may also face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable. Moreover, violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could materially and adversely impact our business, reputation and results of operations. Risks related to our use of third-party sales intermediaries and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses and weaken our competitive position.\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm its business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers.\nThe Company derives a portion of its revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S. federal, state and local as well as foreign governments and their respective agencies, and, as a result, it is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. The Company is also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment, which could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations. If the Company’s government contracts are terminated, if it is suspended from government work or if its ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, the Company’s business could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in\npre-tax\nincome between tax jurisdictions, changing application of tax law and tax audit examinations.\nThe Company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0% up to 34% in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including, but not limited to, changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates, could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the Company’s income tax expense, effective tax rate and results of operations.\nGovernments in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time. From 2024, various foreign jurisdictions are beginning to implement aspects of the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic\nCo-operation\nand Development related to the new Pillar Two system of global minimum tax rules. These new tax laws and regulations, and any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations, could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden, which would negatively affect the Company’s profitability. The Company continues to monitor the adoption of the Pillar Two rules in additional jurisdictions.\nThe Company entered into a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. Prior to April 1, 2021, the Company had a tax exemption in Singapore on certain types of income, based upon the achievement and continued satisfaction of certain operational and financial milestones, which the Company met as of December 31, 2020 and maintained through March 2021. The Company had determined that it was more likely than not to realize the tax exemption in Singapore and, accordingly, did not recognize any reserves for unrecognized tax benefits on its balance sheet related to this tax exemption. If any of the milestone targets were not met, the Company would not have been entitled to the tax exemption on income earned in Singapore dating back to the start date of the agreement (April 1, 2016), and all the tax benefits previously\n21\nrecognized would be reversed, resulting in the recognition of income tax expense equal to the statutory tax of 17% on income earned during that period.\nAs a global business, the Company is subject to tax audit examinations in various jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company must manage the cost and disruption of responding to governmental audits, investigations and proceedings. In addition, the impact of the settlement of pending or future tax audit examination could have an unfavorable effect on the Company’s income tax expense, effective tax rate and results of operations.\nThe Company may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net carrying value of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1.9 billion. The Wyatt acquisition significantly increased the carrying value of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets, which could lead to potential impairments if Wyatt’s financial results are significantly less than anticipated in the future. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to the Company’s business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates can impair the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments adversely affect the Company’s financial statements in the periods recognized.\nRISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and are able to offer compensation in excess of what we are able to offer. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions, including wage inflation, could have a material impact on our ability to attract and retain talent, our turnover rate and the cost of operating our business. In July 2023, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction that impacted approximately 5% of the Company’s employees. These workforce reductions may not have the desired impact on our cost-saving initiatives, as they could adversely affect our productivity, morale, customer relationships, product quality, innovation capabilities and ability to execute our strategic plans. Moreover, these workforce reductions could expose us to potential litigation, severance costs, reputational damage and loss of key personnel. If we are unable to manage the effects of these workforce reductions or achieve the expected benefits from them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.\nThe loss of key members of management and the risks inherent in succession planning could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nThe operation of the Company requires managerial and operational expertise. None of the Company’s key management employees, with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have an employment contract with the Company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company. If, for any reason, other key personnel do not continue to be active in management, the Company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company’s success also depends on its ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results.\n22\nRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY\nDisruption, cyber-attack or unforeseen problems with the security, maintenance or upgrade of the Company’s information and\nweb-based\nsystems could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business strategy, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its third-party partners, including its software and banking partners, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell products and services, fulfill contract obligations, ship products, collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business. The Company’s technology infrastructure and that of its third-party partners has been, and may in the future be, vulnerable to damage or interruption from, but not limited to, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, unauthorized access to customer or employee data, unauthorized access to and funds transfers from Company bank accounts and other attempts to harm the Company’s systems. In the event of such an incident, the Company has in the past, and may in the future, suffer interruptions in service, loss of assets or data or reduced functionality. The Company attempts to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of proactive measures, including mandatory ongoing employee training and awareness, technical security controls, enhanced data protection and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these mitigation measures, the Company’s systems and those of its partners remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. To date, cybersecurity incidents have not resulted in a material adverse impact to the Company’s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, but future incidents could have such an impact. Additionally, the Company must maintain and periodically upgrade its information and\nweb-based\nsystems, which has caused and will in the future cause temporary interruptions to its technology infrastructure. Any prolonged disruption to the Company’s technology infrastructure, at any of its facilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. While the Company maintains cyber insurance, this insurance may not, however, be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of its systems.\nIf the Company’s security measures are compromised or fail to adequately protect its technology infrastructure, research and development efforts or manufacturing operations, the Company’s products and services may be perceived as vulnerable or unreliable, the information protected by the Company’s controls and processes may be subject to unauthorized access, acquisition or modification, the Company’s brand and reputation could be damaged, the services that the Company provides to its customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using the Company’s products and services, all of which could reduce the Company’s revenue and earnings, increase its expenses and expose it to legal claims and regulatory actions.\nThe Company is in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing analytical instruments to life science, pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety and environmental, academic and governmental customers working in research and development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications, and the Company is also a developer and supplier of software and software-based products that support instrument systems. Many of the Company’s customers are in highly regulated industries. While the Company has invested time and resources implementing measures designed to protect the integrity and security of its technology infrastructure, research and development processes, manufacturing operations, products and services, and the internal and external data managed by the Company, there is a risk these measures will be defeated or compromised or that they are otherwise insufficient to protect against existing or emerging threats. The Company also has acquired companies, products, services and technologies over time and may face inherent risk when integrating these acquisitions into the Company. In addition, at times, the Company faces attempts by third parties to defeat its security measures or exploit vulnerabilities in its systems. These risks will increase as the Company continues to grow and expand geographically, and its systems, products and services become increasingly digital and sensor-and\nweb-based.\nThe Company could suffer significant damage to its brand and reputation if a security incident resulted in unauthorized access to, acquisition of, or modification to the Company’s technology infrastructure, research and development processes, manufacturing operations, its products and services as well as the internal and external\n23\ndata managed by the Company. Such an incident could disrupt the Company’s operations and customers could lose confidence in the Company’s ability to deliver quality and reliable products or services. This could negatively impact sales and could increase costs related to fixing and addressing these incidents and any vulnerabilities exposed by them, as well as to lawsuits, regulatory investigations, claims or legal liability including contractual liability, costs and expenses owed to customers and business partners.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE, REGULATORY OR LEGAL MATTERS\nChanges in governmental regulations and compliance failures could harm the Company’s business.\nThe Company is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including, among others, health and safety, import/export, privacy and data protection, FCPA and environmental laws and regulations. A portion of the Company’s operations are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations are complex, can change frequently and govern an array of product activities, including design, development, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. Any failure by the Company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls, the imposition of fines, restrictions on the Company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations. Additionally, the Company develops, configures and markets its products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations, and any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for its products, increase its expenses or otherwise materially impact its financial position and results of operations.\nRegulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations, and the European Union, as an example, has enacted a broad data protection regulation with fines based on a percentage of global revenues. Changes in laws or regulations associated with enhanced protection of certain sensitive types of personal information, such as information related to health, could greatly increase the cost of compliance and the cost of providing the Company’s products or services. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to comply with laws and regulations on privacy, data security or consumer protection, or other policies, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against the Company or levied by governmental entities or others, or could otherwise adversely affect the business and harm the Company’s reputation.\nSome of the Company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing, handling, use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances. This requires the Company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations. If the Company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products, it could face civil and/or criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant.\nSome of the Company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization. The Company must comply with these rules, as well as those of other agencies, such as the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification and/or the imposition of fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations.\nAs a publicly-traded company, the Company is subject to the rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Company must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, which require the Company to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s efforts to comply with such laws and regulations are time consuming and costly. While we continue to enhance our controls, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Failure to comply with such regulations or having inadequate internal controls could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and operations, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\n24\nThe Company is subject to the rules of the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which require disclosure as to whether certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which may be contained in the Company’s products, are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. In 2022, the Company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products. However, the Company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The Company is in the process of evaluating its 2023 supply chain, and the Company plans to file its 2023 Form SD with the SEC in May 2024. The results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the Company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products.\nThe Company may be harmed by improper conduct of any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect the Company from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate domestic and international laws, including laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and\nnon-monetary\npenalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements. In addition, any allegations of issues resulting from the misuse of our products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to purchase products from us. Any such allegations could cause us to lose customers and divert our resources from other tasks, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nEnvironmental, social and corporate governance (“ESG”) issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters. Additionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies’ ESG practices continue to grow. If our ESG practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or investor, customer, consumer, employee or other stakeholders’ evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship and sustainability, support for local communities, director and employee diversity, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, product quality, supply chain management, corporate governance and transparency, our reputation, brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to conduct business with us.\nCustomers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, energy and water use, plastic waste and other sustainability concerns. Concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials, in particular, may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Changing customer and consumer preferences or increased regulatory requirements may result in increased demands or requirements regarding plastics and packaging materials, including\nsingle-use\nand\nnon-recyclable\nplastic products and packaging, other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability, or increased customer and\n25\nconsumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of substances present in certain of our products. Complying with these demands or requirements could cause us and companies in our supply chain to incur additional manufacturing, operating or product development costs.\nIf we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations, or fail to meet evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and concerns regarding ESG issues, investors may reconsider their capital investment in our Company, and customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business or financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of business that can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of business, as well as regulatory subpoenas, requests for information, investigations and enforcement. Defending or otherwise responding to these matters can divert the Company’s management’s attention and may cause it to incur significant expenses. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nThe effects of climate change could harm the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. In the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use and/or levels of possible emissions from such chemicals and/or other substances, the Company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the Company.\nAnother potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., U.K., Ireland and Germany. In addition, the Company manufactures a growing percentage of its HPLC, UPLC and MS products in both Singapore and Ireland. Severe weather and geological conditions or events, including earthquakes, hurricanes and/or tsunamis, could potentially cause significant damage to the Company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries. The effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations and the impact of lost sales could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the Company.\nEstimates and assumptions made in accounting for the Company’s results from operations are dependent on future results, which involve significant judgments and may be imprecise and may differ materially from actual results.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in preparation of our financial statements which is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. The Company believes that the accounting related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, litigation, business combinations and asset acquisitions and inventory valuation involves\n26\nsignificant judgments and estimates. Actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes to the Company’s retirement plans or retirement plan assets.\nThe Company sponsors various retirement plans, both inside and outside the United States. Any changes in regulations made by governments in countries in which the Company sponsors retirement plans could adversely impact the Company’s cash flows or results of operations. In connection with these retirement plans, the Company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets. For example, changes in long-term interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure the Company’s retirement plan obligations and related expense. In addition, changes in the market value of investments held by the retirement plans could materially impact the funded status of the retirement plans, and affect the related pension expense and level and timing of contributions required under applicable laws.\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow.\nThe Company had $2.4 billion in debt and $396 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company also had the ability to borrow an additional $0.9 billion from its existing, committed credit facility. All but a small portion of the Company’s debt was in the U.S. There is a substantial cash requirement in the United States to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest obligations, finance potential United States acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs. As such, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to generate and maintain a sufficient level of cash flow to address these requirements through (1) cash from operations, (2) the Company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility, (3) the ability to expand the Company’s borrowing capacity and (4) other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost.\nDebt covenants, and the Company’s failure to comply with them, could negatively impact the Company’s capital and financial results.\nThe Company’s existing debt is, and future debt may be, subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the Company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the Company. These debt covenants include restrictions on the Company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements, which may limit the Company’s ability to make dividend or other payments, secure other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the Company’s debt agreements. The Company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and all other covenants is dependent on the Company’s future performance, which is subject to, but not limited to, prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond the Company’s control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. Failure to comply with restrictive debt covenants that are not waived or cured could result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the applicable debt and require the Company to prepay the debt before its scheduled due date."

We regularly evaluate new and emerging risks and ever-changing legal and compliance requirements. We make\n27\nstrategic investments to address these risks and legal and compliance requirements to keep Company, customer and employee data secure. We monitor risks of sensitive information compromise at our business partners where relevant and reevaluate these risks on a periodic basis. We also perform annual and ongoing cybersecurity training and awareness for our employees.\nWe have a longstanding information security risk management framework structured according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, industry best practices, privacy legislation, and other global and local standards and regulations. This risk management framework is under the specific oversight of the Company’s Vice President and Chief Information Officer (the “CIO”) and includes a\ndefense-in-depth\napproach with multiple layers of security controls, including network segmentation, security monitoring, endpoint protection, and identity and access management, as well as data protection best practices and data loss prevention controls. Our Audit and Finance Committee is updated on the overall performance of our information security risk management framework on an annual basis by the CIO.\nOur cybersecurity awareness program includes regular phishing simulations, annual general cybersecurity awareness, and data protection modules, as well as more contextual and personalized modules for targeted users and roles. We also perform simulations and drills at both a technical and leadership level at least annually. We incorporate external expertise and guidance in all aspects of our cybersecurity program. We complete annual internal security audits and vulnerability assessments of the Company’s information systems and related controls, including systems affecting personal data. In addition, we leverage cybersecurity specialists to complete annual external audits and objective assessments of our cybersecurity program and practices, including our data protection practices, as well as to conduct targeted attack simulations. We continually enhance our information security capabilities in order to protect against emerging threats, while also increasing our ability to detect and respond to cyber incidents and maximize our resilience to recover from potential cyber-attacks. We have a robust incident response plan in place that provides a documented playbook for responding to cybersecurity incidents and facilitates coordination across multiple parts of our Company. Additionally, we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection, should a data breach occur.\nDespite the existence of mitigation measures, the Company’s systems and those of its partners remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. To date, cybersecurity incidents have not resulted in a material adverse impact to the Company’s business strategy, results of operations and financial condition, but future incidents could have such an impact. See Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Cybersecurity.\nThe Board of Directors oversees the Company’s information security risk management framework that seeks to identify new risks, develop and implement risk mitigation plans, and monitor the results affecting the Company’s business and operations on an ongoing basis. The CIO manages this framework, in collaboration with the Company’s businesses and functions. The CIO presents updates to the Audit and Finance Committee at least annually and, as necessary, to the full Board of Directors. These reports include detailed updates on the Company’s performance preparing for, preventing, detecting, responding to and recovering from cyber incidents. The CIO also promptly informs and updates the Board of Directors about any information security incidents that may pose significant risk to the Company. The Company’s program is periodically evaluated by external experts, and the results of those reviews are reported to the Audit and Finance Committee and the Board of Directors. Together with management, the Audit and Finance Committee reviews the Company’s risk assessment and risk management practices and discusses major cybersecurity risk exposures as well as steps taken by management to monitor and control such exposures.\nThe Company’s Vice President and Chief Information Officer has over 24 years of business experience managing risks from cybersecurity threats/developing and implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures, as well as several relevant certifications.\n28"

As of February 23, 2024, the Company had 69 common stockholders of record. The Company has not declared or paid any dividends on its common stock in its past three fiscal years and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on restrictions and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

    "text": "Business Overview\nThe Company has two operating segments: Waters and TA. Waters products and services primarily consist of high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. Operations of the recently acquired Wyatt business are part of the Waters operating segment.\nWyatt Acquisition\nOn May 16, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Wyatt Technology, LLC and its three operating subsidiaries, Wyatt Technology Europe GmbH, Wyatt Technology France and Wyatt Technology UK Ltd. (collectively, “Wyatt”), for a total purchase price of $1.3 billion in cash. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories, and services. The acquisition will expand Waters portfolio and increase exposure to large molecule applications. The Company financed this transaction with a combination of cash on its balance sheet and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The Company’s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 include the financial results of the Wyatt acquisition from the acquisition date.\nFinancial Overview\nThe Company’s operating results are as follows for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\n34\nThe Company’s net sales decreased 1% in 2023 as compared to 2022 and increased 7% in 2022 as compared to 2021. The Company’s sales in 2023 were negatively impacted by a 22% reduction of sales in China due to lower customer demand for our products. The sales growth in 2022 was driven by strong customer demand across most major geographies, end markets and product categories. Excluding China, the Company’s sales growth increased 5% and 6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Foreign currency translation decreased sales growth by 1% and 5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Wyatt acquisition increased sales growth by 3% in 2023.\nInstrument system sales decreased 7% in 2023 as compared to 2022 and increased 11% in 2022 as compared to 2021. In 2023, the decrease in instrument system sales resulted from weaker customer demand in China, which was partially offset by sales growth in the U.S. and Europe. Excluding China, the Company’s instrument system sales grew 1%. In addition, Wyatt’s instrument system sales added 4% to the Company’s instrument system sales growth. In 2022, the increase was driven by the broad-based increase in customer demand across all existing and newly introduced LC,\nLC-MS,\nand Thermal Analysis instrument system sales. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales growth by 1% and 5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRecurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 6% and 3% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Recurring revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation in 2023 and 2022, which decreased sales by 1% and 6%, respectively.\nOperating income was $818 million in 2023, a decrease of 6% as compared to 2022. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher salary expenses related to merit compensation, $26 million in severance-related costs associated with a workforce reduction and costs related to the Wyatt acquisition, including $13 million in due diligence costs, $27 million of intangible asset amortization and $19 million of costs associated with retention agreements. The negative effect of foreign currency translation lowered operating income by approximately $23 million during 2023.\nIn July 2023, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction that impacted approximately 5% of the Company’s employees. The Company incurred approximately $26 million of severance-related costs and paid approximately $19 million of severance-related costs in 2023, with the remaining costs to be paid in the first half of 2024. The Company estimates that the savings from this reduction in workforce will be approximately $48 million on an annual basis.\nOperating income was $873 million in 2022, an increase of 6% as compared to 2021. This increase was primarily a result of the increase in sales volume and pricing increases, partially offset by higher electronic component and freight inflationary costs and the negative effect of foreign currency translation. The effect of foreign currency translation lowered operating income by approximately $71 million during 2022.\nOperating income as a percentage of sales was 27.7%, 29.4% and 29.5% in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company’s effective tax rates were 12.8%, 15.5% and 14.1% for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net income per diluted share was $10.84, $11.73 and $11.17 in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company generated $603 million, $612 million and $747 million of net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in 2023 operating cash flow was primarily a result of lower sales volumes, higher income tax payments and higher incentive compensation payments in 2023 as compared to 2022.\nNet cash used in investing activities included $1.3 billion for the Wyatt acquisition in 2023 and capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $161 million, $176 million and\n35\n$161 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The cash flows used in investing activities in 2023, 2022 and 2021 included $16 million, $32 million, and $49 million, respectively, of capital expenditures related to the major expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the United States.\nDuring 2023, the Company funded the Wyatt acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The Company’s outstanding debt on December 31, 2023 was $2.4 billion, a change of $0.8 billion from December 31, 2022, which resulted in the Company’s interest expense in 2023 increasing by $50 million to $99 million.\nOn March 3, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the credit agreement governing its revolving credit facility (the “2023 Amendment”). The 2023 Amendment increases the borrowing capacity by $200 million to an aggregate total borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion.\nIn December 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the existing share repurchase program through January 21, 2025. The Company’s remaining authorization is $1.0 billion. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased $58 million, $616 million and $640 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under the share repurchase programs. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions, given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, it has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to its acquisition of Wyatt in the second quarter of 2023.\nResults of Operations\nSales by Geography\nGeographic sales information is presented below for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nIn 2023, sales decreased 1% as compared to 2022, primarily as a result of a 22% decrease in China sales during 2023, which was partially offset by broad-based sales growth across most other major regions. The decline in China sales was primarily driven by lower demand for our instrument systems and chemistry products resulting from increased government regulations and lower spending by our customers due to weak economic conditions in China. Excluding China, the Company’s sales increased 5% and 6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Foreign currency translation decreased sales growth by 1% and 5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn 2023, sales increased 5% in the U.S. and 7% in Europe, while decreasing 11% in Asia, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales growth in Europe by 2% and decreasing sales growth in Asia by 4%,\n36\nwhich includes a 9% decrease in sales in Japan resulting from foreign currency translation. Wyatt’s sales contributed 5% and 3% of sales growth to the U.S. and Europe in 2023, respectively.\nThe sales growth in 2022 was broad-based across most major regions. Foreign currency translation decreased total sales growth by 5% in 2022 as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against all other major currencies. The geographies that were the most negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2022 were Europe and Japan, as the weakening of the euro and Japanese yen lowered sales growth in Europe and Japan by 10% and 17%, respectively. China sales increased 8% in 2022, with foreign currency translation decreasing China sales growth by 2% in 2022. This increase in China sales was driven by strong customer demand for our products and services despite the negative impact that the\nCOVID-19\npandemic had on our business in China in 2022.\nSales by Trade Class\nNet sales by customer class are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nIn 2023, sales to pharmaceutical customers decreased 3%, primarily driven by weakness in customer demand in China, with foreign currency translation decreasing pharmaceutical sales growth by 1% and Wyatt contributing 3% to the Company’s pharmaceutical sales growth. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, were flat in 2023, with foreign currency translation decreasing industrial sales growth by 1% and Wyatt contributing 1% to industrial sales growth. Combined sales to academic and government customers increased 13% in 2023, with foreign currency translation decreasing academic and government sales growth by 1% and Wyatt contributing 4% to academic and government sales growth. Sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period.\nIn 2022, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 5%, driven by strong growth in most major regions, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation which decreased pharmaceutical sales by 5%. Combined sales to industrial customers increased 10%, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 5%. Combined sales to academic and government customers increased 7%, with foreign currency translation decreasing academic and government sales growth by 6%.\n37\nWaters Products and Services Net Sales\nNet sales for Waters products and services were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nWaters products and service sales decreased 1% and 6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing Waters sales growth by 1% and 6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Wyatt acquisition increased Waters products and service sales by approximately 3% in 2023. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) decreased 8% in 2023, primarily driven by weaker customer demand in China. Excluding China, the Company’s instrument system sales were flat as compared to 2022. In addition, Wyatt’s instrument system sales contributed 5% to Waters instrument system sales growth in 2023. Waters chemistry consumables sales were significantly impacted by the lower customer demand in China for our products. Excluding China, the Company’s chemistry sales grew 7% in 2023. This sales growth was primarily due to the continued strong demand in most major geographies, driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation, which decreased chemistry sales growth by 1% in 2023. Waters service sales increased 7% in 2023 due to higher service demand billing, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation, which decreased service sales growth by 1% in 2023. Wyatt service revenues added 2% to Waters service revenue growth in 2023.\nIn 2022, Waters products and service sales increased 6%, with foreign currency translation decreasing Waters sales growth by 6%. Waters instrument system sales grew 11%, with foreign currency translation lowering sales growth by 5%. The increase in the Waters instrument system sales can be attributed to strong customer demand for our existing products as well as growing contributions made by recent product introductions. The increase in Waters chemistry consumables sales was primarily due to the strong demand in most major geographies, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation which decreased sales by 5%. Waters service sales increased due to higher service demand billing, particularly in China and the United States, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation which decreased by 6%.\nTA Product and Services Net Sales\nNet sales for TA products and services were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nTA instrument system and service sales increased 3% and 10% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales growth in 2023 and decreased sales growth by 6% in 2022. In\n38\n2023, sales growth was broad-based across most major geographies, partially offset by weakness in China and the rest of Asia. These increases were primarily driven by strong customer demand for our thermal analysis instruments and services.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales decreased 4% in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to the change in sales mix and the lower material and freight costs. In 2022, cost of sales increased 8% as compared to 2021, primarily due to the increase in sales volumes during the year as well as an increase in electronic component and freight inflationary costs.\nCost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to be neutral to gross profit during 2024.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses increased 12% and 5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in 2023 is primarily driven by severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce, which increased expenses by 4%; the Wyatt acquisition due diligence and integration costs, which increased expenses by 2%; and the Wyatt acquisition-related retention expense, which increased expenses by 3%. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. The increase in selling and administrative expenses in 2022 as compared to 2021 can be attributed to higher salary merit and variable incentive compensation costs due to an increase in the number of employees. The effect of foreign currency translation had minimal impact on selling and administrative expenses in 2023 and decreased expenses by 4% in 2022.\nAs a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 24.9%, 22.1% and 22.5% for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased 1% and increased 5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2023 can be attributed to increases from merit compensation and costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives, being offset by lower incentive compensation costs. The impact of foreign currency exchange decreased expenses by 1% and 3% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nPurchased Intangibles Amortization\nThe increase in purchased intangible amortization of $26 million in 2023 can be attributed to the Wyatt acquisition intangible assets.\nAcquired\nIn-Process\nResearch & Development\nIn 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the CDMS technology assets of Megadalton were acquired for approximately $10 million in total purchase price, of which $5 million was paid at closing and the remaining $4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029.\nOther (Expense) Income, net\nIn 2022, the Company sold equity an equity investment for $10 million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $7 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. The Company also incurred $6 million in losses on an equity investment within other income, net on the statement of operations.\nIn 2021, the Company executed a settlement agreement to resolve patent infringement litigation with Bruker Corporation and Bruker Daltronik GmbH regarding their timsTOF product line. In connection with the\n39\nsettlement, the Company is entitled to receive $10 million in guaranteed payments, including minimum royalty payments. In 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $10 million due to an observable change in the fair value of an existing investment that the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense in 2023 increased $44 million as compared to 2022 due to the additional borrowings by the Company to fund the Wyatt acquisition in 2023. Net interest expense in 2022 increased $5 million as compared to 2021 due to the lower interest income benefit from the lower notional amount of interest rate cross currency swap agreements.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 25% and 17%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. Prior to April 1, 2021, the Company had a tax exemption on income arising from qualifying activities in Singapore based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company met as of December 31, 2020 and maintained through March 2021. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income arising from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income by $16 million, $20 million and $20 million, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.27, $0.33 and $0.32 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 12.8%, 15.5% and 14.1%, respectively.\nThe 2023 effective tax rate differed from the 21% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, an $18 million recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit as a result of the completion of a tax examination, a $15 million provision related to the Global Intangible\nLow-Taxed\nIncome (“GILTI”) tax and a tax benefit of $3 million on stock-based compensation.\nThe 2022 effective tax rate differed from the 21% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, an $18 million provision related to the GILTI tax and a tax benefit of $7 million on stock-based compensation.\nThe 2021 effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, a $10 million provision related to the GILTI tax and a tax benefit of $7 million on stock-based compensation.\nEffective starting in 2024, various foreign jurisdictions are beginning to implement aspects of the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic\nCo-operation\nand Development related to the new Pillar Two system of global minimum tax rules. The Company does not believe these changes in tax law will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in 2024. The Company continues to monitor the adoption of the Pillar Two rules in additional jurisdictions.\n40\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $603 million, $612 million and $747 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in 2023 operating cash flow was primarily a result of lower net income, higher inventory levels, higher income tax payments and higher incentive compensation payments in 2023 as compared to 2022. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, in addition to the changes in net income:\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $1.4 billion, $108 million and $232 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $161 million, $176 million and $161 million\n41\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The cash flows from investing activities in 2023, 2022 and 2021 include $16 million, $32 million and $49 million, respectively, of capital expenditures related to the major expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the United States. The Company has incurred costs of $248 million on this new\nstate-of-the-art\nfacility, which is substantially complete as of December 31, 2023.\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company purchased $2 million, $11 million and $280 million of investments, respectively, while $2 million, $78 million and $218 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below.\nIn 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Wyatt for a total purchase price of $1.3 billion in cash. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories, and services. The acquisition will expand Waters’ portfolio and increase exposure to large molecule applications.\nIn 2022, the Company paid $5 million for the CDMS technology and intellectual property right asset from Megadalton, and the Company is required to make an additional $4 million of guaranteed payments at various dates in the future through 2029. The total purchase price of approximately $10 million was accounted for as Acquired\nIn-Process\nResearch and Development and expensed as part of costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations in 2023.\nThere were no business acquisitions in 2022 and 2021.\nIn 2022, the Company received $10 million in proceeds and made $1 million of investments in certain equity investments. In 2021, the Company made $2 million of investments in certain equity investments.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nThe Company entered into a credit agreement in September 2021 governing the Company’s five-year, $1.8 billion revolving facility that matures in September 2026. On March 3, 2023, in anticipation of closing of the Wyatt acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the credit agreement governing its revolving credit facility (the “2023 Amendment”). The 2023 Amendment increases the borrowing capacity by $200 million to an aggregate total borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a total of $2.4 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.3 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $1.1 billion in borrowings under its credit agreement. The Company’s net debt borrowings as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $780 million, $60 million and $160 million higher than as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value $625 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and\nyen-denominated\nnet asset investments. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company lowered net interest expense by approximately $11 million, $9 million and $15 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company anticipates that these swap agreements will lower net interest expense by approximately $7 million in 2024.\nIn December 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the existing share repurchase program through January 21, 2025. The Company’s remaining authorization is $1.0 billion. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased $58 million, $616 million and $640 million, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $12 million, $11 million and $9 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company received $30 million, $43 million and $56 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n42\nThe Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $396 million as of December 31, 2023. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $321 million held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2023, of which $233 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:\nLong-term debt.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $2.4 billion of cash requirements for the principal on long-term debt that will mature and be paid as follows: $50 million in 2024; $1.5 billion in 2026; $50 million in 2028; $300 million in 2029; $50 million in 2030 and $400 million in 2031.\nInterest on Senior Unsecured Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $189 million of cash requirements for the interest on senior unsecured notes that is to be paid as follows: $39 million in 2024; $38 million in 2025; $32 million in 2026; $25 million in 2027; $23 million in 2028; $20 million in 2029; $10 million in 2030; and $2 million in 2031. See also Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about interest payable.\n2017 Tax Act liabilities.\nAs a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company incurred a Transition Toll Tax, that would be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a remaining cash requirement of $216 million of which $96 million and $120 million will be paid in 2024 and 2025, respectively. See also Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about tax liabilities.\nOperating Leases.\nThe Company’s cash requirements for future lease payments were approximately $93 million as of December 31, 2023. See also Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about lease liabilities.\nLong-term Software Contract Commitments.\nFor contracts the Company is committed to that are not cancelable without penalties. The Company’s contractual obligation with these vendors was approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2023.\nWyatt Retention Agreements.\nIn conjunction with the Wyatt acquisition, the Company entered into retention agreements with certain employees, in which the Company agreed to pay a total of $40 million by the end of the second anniversary of the acquisition date provided the employees remain employed over that period of time.\nManagement believes, as of the date of this report, that the Company’s financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSummary\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and\n43\nestimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services. Revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts.\nThe Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer. In substantially all of the Company’s arrangements, title of the product transfers at shipping point and, as a result, the Company determined control transfers at the point of shipment. In more limited cases, there are destination-based shipping terms and, thus, control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site.\nGenerally, the Company’s contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation. The Company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service, which requires judgment. The Company determines the relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours. In developing these estimates, the Company considers past history, competition, billing rates of current services and other factors.\nThe Company has sales from standalone software, which are included in product revenue. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which the Company has determined are distinct performance obligations. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a\nwhen-and-if-available\nbasis.\nService revenue includes (i) service and software maintenance contracts and (ii) service calls (time and materials). Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. The amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the maintenance service period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.\nThe Company’s deferred revenue liabilities at December 31, 2023 of $324 million on the consolidated balance sheets consist of instrument service contract obligations and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period.\n44\nLoss Provision on Inventory\nThe Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a\nfirst-in,\nfirst-out\nbasis (“FIFO”). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand, including in the Company’s current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. The Company’s inventory balance at December 31, 2023 was recorded at its net realizable value of $516 million, which is net of write-downs of $41 million.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows, including forecasted revenue growth and the discount rate to determine the fair value of these assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined.\nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below an operating segment. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing the quantitative assessment. If as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is\nmore-likely-than-not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required. If a quantitative impairment test is performed, we compare the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. Estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment for its reporting units as of December 31 each year. The Company has two reporting units: Waters and TA. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition.\nThe Company’s intangible assets include purchased technology; capitalized software; costs associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses; and acquired IPR&D. Purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years. Other intangibles are amortized over a period ranging from one to ten years. Acquired IPR&D is amortized from the date of completion of the acquired program over its estimated useful life.\nGoodwill totaled $1.3 billion and $430 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net intangible assets and long-lived assets amounted to $629 million and $639 million, as of December 31, 2023, respectively, and $227 million and $582 million as of December 31, 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its income taxes, taking into account the amount, timing and character of taxable income, tax deductions and credits and assessing changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties. Differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, such changes could materially impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations.\n45\nThe Company continually evaluates the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money. The Company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. At December 31, 2023, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, of $14 million, which represents a decrease of $15 million resulting, primarily, from the completion of a tax examination in 2023. This decrease reduced the income tax expense in the statement of operations and did not impact cash flows.\nThe Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. This new incentive has similar requirements for business spending targets, attaining and sustaining employment targets and performance of certain research and manufacturing activities as previous agreements. Prior to April 1, 2021, the Company had a tax exemption on income arising from qualifying activities in Singapore, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company met as of December 31, 2020 and maintained through March 2021. These milestones include the following types of objectives: reaching and maintaining annual revenue and business spending targets; meeting capital expenditures targets; attaining and sustaining employment targets; and establishing a local research and development and service center. The Company determined that it was more likely than not to realize the tax exemption in Singapore and, accordingly, did not recognize any reserves for unrecognized tax benefits on its balance sheet related to this exemption. In the event that any of the milestone targets were not met, the Company would not be entitled to the tax exemption on income earned in Singapore and all the tax benefits previously recognized would be reversed, resulting in the recognition of income tax expense equal to the statutory tax of 17% on income earned during that period.\nThe effect of applying these concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income arising from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income by $16 million, $20 million and $20 million and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.27, $0.33 and $0.32 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nWe use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represents a significant portion of the purchase price in our recent acquisition of Wyatt, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or\nnon-amortizable\nand, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. We utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income, cost and market approaches, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of intangible assets. Typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.\nIn our recent acquisition of Wyatt, customer relationship intangible assets have been the most significant identifiable assets acquired. The customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. Our cash flow projections for the customer relationships acquired included significant judgments and assumptions related to customer attrition rate, discount rate, and forecasted revenues. The value of the client relationships acquired was $331 million in fiscal year 2023, the majority of which relates to US customer relationships.\n46\nRecent Accounting Standard Changes and Developments\nInformation regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this document and should be considered an integral part of this Item 7. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards."

    "text": "Derivative Transactions\nThe Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its\nnon-U.S.\ndollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars, and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency.\nThe Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and\nyen-denominated\nnet asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows.\nForeign Currency Exchange Contracts\nThe Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates these net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company’s Credit Facility is a variable borrowing and has interest payments based on a contractually specified interest rate index. The contractually specified index on the Credit Facility is the 3-month Term SOFR. The variable rate interest payments create interest risk for the Company as interest payments will fluctuate based on changes in the contractually specified interest rate index over the life of the Credit Facility. In order to reduce interest rate risk, the Company enters into interest rate swaps that will effectively lock-in the forecasted interest payments on the variable rate borrowing over its term. The interest rate swaps represent cash flow hedges and are assessed for hedge effectiveness each reporting period. When the hedge relationship is highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows, the Company will record the entire change in fair value of the interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The amount in accumulated other comprehensive loss is reclassified to earnings in the period that the underlying transaction impacts consolidated earnings. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to earnings in the current period. Interest settlements due to benchmark interest rate changes are recorded in interest income or interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any cash flow hedges that were deemed ineffective.\n47\nInterest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of $625 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and\nyen-denominated\nnet asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations.\nThe Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate cross-currency swap agreements and interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges are included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands):\nThe following is a summary of the activity included in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts, and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements and interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges (in thousands):\nAssuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in\nyear-end\nexchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2023 would increase\npre-tax\nearnings by approximately $5 million. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in\nyear-end\nexchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the interest rate\n48\ncross-currency swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2023 would increase by approximately $1 million and would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. The related impact on interest income would not have a material effect on\npre-tax\nearnings.\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in bank deposits, U.S. treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2023, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio.\nThe Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $321 million out of $396 million and $472 million out of $481 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $233 million out of $396 million and $336 million out of $481 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles.\nAssuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in\nyear-end\nexchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2023 would decrease by approximately $23 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.\n49\nDOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE\nPortions of the registrant’s definitive proxy statement that will be filed for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders are incorporated by reference in Part III."

    "text": "Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in\nRules 13a-15(f)\nand\n15d-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013), our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nWe excluded Wyatt Technology, LLC, and its three operating subsidiaries, (Wyatt Technology Europe GmbH, Wyatt Technology France and Wyatt Technology UK Ltd) (collectively “Wyatt”) from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, because Wyatt was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2023. The total assets and total revenues of Wyatt represent 2% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\n50\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Wyatt Technology, LLC, and its three operating subsidiaries, Wyatt Technology Europe GmbH, Wyatt Technology France, and Wyatt Technology UK Ltd (collectively Wyatt) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase\n51\nbusiness combination during 2023. We have also excluded Wyatt from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Wyatt is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 2% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nProduct Revenue Recognition\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer. Certain of the Company’s customers have terms where control of the product transfers to the customer on shipment, while others have terms where control transfers to the customer on delivery. Product sales totaled $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to product revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s product revenue recognition.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to product revenue recognition. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the recognition of revenue for a sample of transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as invoices, customer purchase orders, and shipping documents, and (ii) obtaining and inspecting evidence of remittance of cash payment from customers, as applicable, related to product revenue.\n52\nAcquisition of Wyatt Technology, LLC—Valuation of U.S. Customer Relationships\nAs described in Notes 1, 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, on May 16, 2023, the Company completed the Wyatt acquisition for a total purchase price of $1.3 billion. Management allocated the purchase price of the acquisition to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. As disclosed by management, of the $330.6 million of customer relationships recorded in connection with the acquisition, a majority relates to U.S. customer relationships. The customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. Management’s cash flow projections for the customer relationships acquired included significant judgments and assumptions related to customer attrition rate, discount rate, and forecasted revenues.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of U.S. customer relationships acquired in the acquisition of Wyatt Technology, LLC is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value estimate of the U.S. customer relationships acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the customer attrition rate, discount rate, and forecasted revenues, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the U.S. customer relationships acquired. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the U.S. customer relationships acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings method; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the customer attrition rate, discount rate, and forecasted revenues. Evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the customer attrition rate, discount rate and forecasted revenues involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the Wyatt business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the customer attrition, discount rate, and forecasted revenue assumptions.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1994.\n53\nWATERS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n54\nWATERS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n55\nWATERS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n56\nWATERS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n57\nWATERS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n58\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1 Description of Business and Organization\nWaters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), a global leader in analytical instruments and software, has pioneered innovations in chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis serving life, materials and food sciences for more than 65 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together\n(“LC-MS”)\nand sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing.\nLC-MS\ninstruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA Instruments product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments.\nOn May 16, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Wyatt Technology, LLC and its three operating subsidiaries, Wyatt Technology Europe GmbH, Wyatt Technology France and Wyatt Technology UK Ltd. (collectively, “Wyatt”), for a total purchase price of $\n1.3\nbillion in cash. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories and services. The acquisition will expand Waters’ portfolio and increase exposure to large molecule applications. The Company financed this transaction with a combination of cash on its balance sheet and borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\n2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, litigation and inventory valuation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies.\n59\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or controls 50% or more of the voting shares. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies\nThe functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows.\nFor the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company’s net sales derived from operations outside the United States were\n69\n%,\n70\n% and\n72\n% in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included primarily in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, foreign currency transactions resulted in net losses of $\n16\nmillion, $\n31\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion, respectively.\nSeasonality of Business\nThe Company typically experiences seasonality in its orders that is reflected as an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar\nyear-end.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\nCash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in bank deposits, U.S. treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper.\nInvestments with longer maturities are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. treasury bills, U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities.\nInvestments are classified as available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities. If the AFS debt security’s fair value exceeds the security’s amortized cost the unrealized gain is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity (deficit), net of the related tax effects. If the AFS debt security’s fair value declines below its amortized cost the Company considers all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. If the decline is due to noncredit-related factors then no credit loss is recorded and the unrealized loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity, net of the related tax effects. If the decline is considered to be a credit-related impairment, it is recognized as an allowance on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding charge to the statement of operations. The credit allowance is limited to the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost basis. No credit-related allowances or impairments have been recognized on the Company’s investments in available-for-sale debt securities. The Company classifies its investments exclusive of those categorized as cash equivalents.\n60\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $\n321\nmillion out of $\n396\nmillion and $\n472\nmillion out of $\n481\nmillion, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $\n233\nmillion out of $\n396\nmillion and $\n336\nmillion out of $\n481\nmillion of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The Company does not consider there to be significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the short-term nature of the balances, the Company having a large and diverse customer base, and the Company having a strong historical experience of collecting receivables with minimal defaults. As a result, credit risk is considered low across territories and trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial asset. The allowance for credit losses is based on a number of factors and is calculated by applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery. Past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forward-looking information are included in the specific adjustment. The historical loss rate is reviewed on at least an annual basis and the allowance for credit losses is reviewed quarterly for any required adjustments. The Company does not have any\noff-balance\nsheet credit exposure related to its customers.\nTrade receivables related to instrument sales are collateralized by the instrument that is sold. If there is a risk of default related to a receivable that is collateralized, then the fair value of the collateral is calculated and adjusted for the cost to\nre-possess,\nrefurbish and\nre-sell\nthe instrument. This adjusted fair value is compared to the receivable balance and the difference would be recorded as the expected credit loss.\nThe following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for credit losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company sells its products and services to a significant number of large and small customers throughout the world, with net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately\n57\n%,\n59\n% and\n60\n% in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. None of the Company’s individual customers accounted for more than\n2\n% of annual Company sales in 2023, 2022 or 2021. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral, but in certain circumstances may require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant credit losses.\n61\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nInventory\nThe Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a\nfirst-in,\nfirst-out\nbasis (“FIFO”).\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its income taxes, taking into account the amount, timing and character of taxable income, tax deductions and credits and assessing changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties. Differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, such changes could materially impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations.\nThe accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods.\nThe Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money. The Company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nLeases\nThe Company’s lease portfolio consists primarily of operating leases. The Company’s operating leases consist of property leases for sales, demonstration, laboratory, warehouse and office spaces, automotive leases for sales and service personnel and equipment leases, primarily used in our manufacturing and distribution operations. The Company categorizes leases as either operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. The Company does not have any material financing leases.\nThe Company makes variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, primarily for items such as real estate taxes and other expenses. These expenses are recorded as variable costs in the period incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, variable costs incurred were not material.\nThe Company’s lease agreements may include tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, and/or contingent rent provisions as well as a certain number of these leases contain rental escalation clauses that are either fixed or adjusted periodically for inflation of market rates which are factored into our determination of lease payments at lease inception. The Company’s leases also sometimes include renewal options and/or termination options which are included in the determination of the lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nThe Company has lease agreements which contain lease and\nnon-lease\ncomponents, which are accounted for as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets.\nFor leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company records a\nright-of-use\nasset and lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term of the leases and records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases with terms less than 12 months. For short-term leases, the Company recognizes lease payments in net income on a\n62\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nstraight-line basis over the term of the lease. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, costs incurred related to short-term leases were not material.\nWhen available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to determine the present value of the lease liabilities; however, most of the leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate and, as required by the accounting guidance, the Company estimates its incremental secured borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement (or, for the leases in existence on the adoption date, the January 1, 2019 information). The Company’s incremental borrowing rate reflects the estimated rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, while the costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings —\nfifteen\nto\nthirty-nine\nyears; building improvements —\nfive\nto\nten years\n; leasehold improvements — the shorter of the economic useful life or life of lease; and production and other equipment — three to\nten years\n. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated balance sheets and related gains or losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAsset Impairments\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment. Whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset based on the expected future cash flows, relying on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. If the asset is deemed not recoverable, it is written down to fair value and the impairment is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring 2022, the Company recorded a total\nnon-cash\ncharge of $\n6\nmillion in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations for the impairment of various equity investments without readily determinable fair values accounted for under the measurement alternative or the equity method of accounting. The impairments resulted from the substantial doubt of the investees ability to continue as a going concern.\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations. The results of each acquisition are included in the Company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. Any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. We use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represents a significant portion of the purchase price in our recent acquisition of Wyatt, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or\nnon-amortizable\nand, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. We utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income, cost and market approaches, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of intangible\nas\nsets. Typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.\n63\nN\nOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nIn our recent acquisition of Wyatt, customer relationship intangible assets have been the most significant identifiable assets acquired. The customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. Our\ncash\nflow projections for the customer relationships acquired included significant judgments and assumptions related to customer attrition rate, discount rate, and forecasted revenues.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows, including forecasted revenue growth and the discount rate to determine the fair value of these assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined.\nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below an operating segment. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing the quantitative assessment. If as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is\nmore-likely-than-not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required. If a quantitative impairment test is performed, we compare the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. Estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment for its reporting units as of December 31 each year. The Company has\ntwo\nreporting units: Waters and TA. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition.\nThe Company’s intangible assets include purchased technology; capitalized software; costs associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses; and acquired IPR&D. Purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from\none\nto\nfifteen years\n. Other intangibles are amortized over a period ranging from\none\nto\nten years\n. Acquired IPR&D is amortized from the date of completion of the acquired program over its estimated useful life.\nGoodwill totaled $\n1.3\nbillion and $\n430\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net intangible assets and long-lived assets amounted to $\n629\nmillion and $\n639\nmillion, as of December 31, 2023, respectively, and $\n227\nmillion and $\n582\nmillion as of December 31, 2022, respectively.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes internal and external software development costs for products offered for sale in accordance with the accounting standards for the costs of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. Capitalized costs are amortized to cost of sales over the period of economic benefit, which approximates a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software products, generally\nthree\nto\nten years\n.\nThe Company capitalized $\n44\nmillion, $\n46\nmillion and $\n36\nmillion of direct expenses that were related to the development of software in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net capitalized software included in intangible assets totaled $\n165\nmillion and $\n148\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangibles.\nThe Company capitalizes software development costs for internal use. Capitalized internal software development costs are amortized over the period of economic benefit, which approximates a straight-line\nbasis\n64\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nover\nten years\n. Net capitalized internal software included in property, plant and equipment totaled $\n14\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther Investments\nThe Company accounts for its investments that represent less than twenty percent ownership, and for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, using the accounting standards for investments in equity securities. Investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, and for which there is not a readily determinable market value, are accounted for at cost, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as applicable. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, and for which there is not a readily determinable fair value and carries them at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes. For equity investments in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee, the equity method of accounting is used. The Company’s share of net income or losses of equity method investments is included in the consolidated statements of operations and was not material in any period presented.\nDuring the year ended 2023, the Company received $\n1\nmillion in proceeds from, and made no investments in, unaffiliated companies. During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company received $\n10\nmillion in proceeds from unaf\nf\niliated companies. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company made investments of $\n1\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion in unaffiliated companies, respectively.\nIn 2022, the Company recorded a realized gain of $\n7\nmillion in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations due to the sales of various equity investments as well as incurring $\n6\nmillion in impairment losses. The Company also recognized an additional $\n2\nmillion\nnon-cash\ngain on the cashless exercise of a warrant.\nIn 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $\n10\nmillion due to an observable change in the fair value of an existing investment the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\n65\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nThe following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\nFair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets\nThe 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges.\n66\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nFair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts, Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swaps Agreements and Interest Rate Swap Cash Flow Hedges\nThe fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments, foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate cross-currency swap agreements and interest rate swap cash flow hedges are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources.\nFair Value of Contingent Consideration\nThe fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations.\nFair Value of Other Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s accounts receivable and accounts payable are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s variable interest rate debt approximates fair value due to the variable nature of the interest rate. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $\n1.3\nbillion at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, using Level 2 inputs.\nDerivative Transactions\nThe Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its\nnon-U.S.\ndollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency.\nThe Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and\nyen-denominated\nnet asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows.\nForeign Currency Exchange Contracts\nThe Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts\n67\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nreceivable\nand accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.\nPrincipal hedged currencies include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company’s Credit Facility is a variable borrowing and has interest payments based on a contractually specified interest rate index. The contractually specified index on the Credit Facility is the\n3-month\nTerm SOFR. The variable rate interest payments create interest risk for the Company as interest payments will fluctuate based on changes in the contractually specified interest rate index over the life of the Credit Facility. In order to reduce interest rate risk, the Company enters into interest rate swaps that will effectively\nlock-in\nthe forecasted interest payments on the variable rate borrowing over its term. The interest rate swaps represent cash flow hedges and are assessed for hedge effectiveness each reporting period. When the hedge relationship is highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows, the Company will record the entire change in fair value of the interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The amount in accumulated other comprehensive loss is reclassified to earnings in the period that the underlying transaction impacts consolidated earnings. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be\nde-designated\nand amounts accumulated in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to earnings in the current period. Interest settlements due to benchmark interest rate changes are recorded in interest income or interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any cash flow hedges that were deemed ineffective.\nInterest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements\nAs\nof December 31, 2023, the Company had entered into interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with durations up to three years with an aggregate notional value of $\n625\nmillion to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and\nyen-denominated\nnet asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations.\n68\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate cross-currency swap agreements\nand\ninterest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges are included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands):\nThe following is a summary of the activity included in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate cross-currency swap agreements and interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges (in thousands):\nStockholders’ Equity\nIn December 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the existing share repurchase program through January 21, 2025. The Company’s remaining authorization is $\n1.0\nbillion. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased\n0.2\nmillion,\n2.0\nmillion and\n2.0\nmillion shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $\n58\nmillion, $\n616\nmillion and $\n640\nmillion, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $\n12\nmillion, $\n11\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has a total of $\n1.0\nb\nillion authorized for future repurchases.\n69\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services. Revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts.\nThe Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer. Certain of the Company’s customers have terms where control of the product transfers to the customer on shipment, while others have terms where control transfers to the customer on delivery. All incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. In situations where the control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of the Company’s obligation to ship the products to its customers, the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost. Accordingly, such costs are recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to the customer. In more rare situations, the Company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. The Company elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions and collected by the Company from a customer.\nGenerally, the Company’s contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation. The Company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service, which requires judgment. The Company determines the relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours. In developing these estimates, the Company considers past history, competition, billing rates of current services and other factors.\nThe Company has sales from standalone software, which are included in product revenue. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which the Company has determined are distinct performance obligations. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a\nwhen-and-if-available\nbasis.\nPayment terms and conditions vary among the Company’s revenue streams, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment. Prior to providing payment terms to customers, an evaluation of their credit risk is performed. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and, therefore, there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products.\nService revenue includes (1) service and software maintenance contracts and (2) service calls (time and materials). Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. The amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the maintenance service period, which\n70\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nis the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.\nProduct Warranty Costs\nThe Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.\nThe following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nAdvertising Costs\nAll advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expenses were $\n7\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has two stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 14, “Stock-Based Compensation”.\nEarnings Per Share\nIn accordance with the earnings per share accounting standards, the Company presents two earnings per share (“EPS”) amounts. Income per basic common share is based on income available to common shareholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Income per diluted common share includes additional dilution from potential common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding.\n71\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nRetirement Plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement plans, which are described in Note 17, “Retirement Plans”.\nComprehensive Income\nThe Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with the accounting standards for comprehensive income, which establish the accounting rules for reporting and displaying comprehensive income. These standards require that all components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements.\nRestructuring\nIn July 2023, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, that has impacted approximately\n5\n% of the Company’s employees. During 2023, the Company incurred $\n26\nmillion of severance-related costs in connection with this reduction, which was recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. During 2023, the Company paid $\n19\nmillion of these costs with the majority of the remaining costs to be paid in the first half of 2024.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn October 2021, accounting guidance was issued that requires acquirers in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The new guidance requires that at the acquisition date, the acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with 606 as if it had originated the contracts. This guidance differs from current GAAP which requires an acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers and other similar contracts that are accounted for in accordance with 606, at fair value on the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, accounting guidance was issued that facilitates the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in the update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January of 2021, an update was issued to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions under the reference rate reform guidance for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in the reference rate reform guidance, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. This temporary guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020, through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, an update was issued because the cessation date for overnight LIBOR rates being published was extended to June 30, 2023, which was beyond the current expiration date of this guidance. The update extended the sunset date to December 31, 2024. The Company may elect to apply this guidance for all contract modifications or eligible hedging relationships during that time period subject to certain criteria. The Company does not believe that it has material reference\n72\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nrate exposure which would require utilizing the guidance under this accounting pronouncement and if adopted does not believe that this standard would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn November 2023, accounting guidance was issued that requires additional disclosures of reportable segment information. The guidance requires that public entities disclose, on an annual and interim basis (1) significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, (2) an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition (the other segment items category is the difference between segment revenue less the segment expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss), (3) provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods, (4) clarify that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit. However, at least one of the reported segment profit or loss measures (or the single reported measure, if only one is disclosed) should be the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the public entity’s consolidated financial statements, (5) the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, and (6) if a public entity has a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. The amendments in this update do not change how operating segments are identified or aggregated nor how the quantitative thresholds are applied to determine its reportable segments. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The Company does not believe this accounting standard update will have material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this accounting standard update will have on our footnote disclosures.\nIn December 2023, accounting guidance was issued to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update change disclosure requirements related to the rate reconciliation, income taxes paid and other disclosures. For the rate reconciliation the amendments require that public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. For income taxes paid the amendments require that all entities disclose on an annual basis the following information; (1) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes, (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than\n5\npercent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Finally, for other disclosures the amendments require that all entities disclose the following information: (1) income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign, and (2) income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign. This update also eliminates the requirement for all entities to (1) disclose the nature and estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in the unrecognized tax benefits balance in the next 12 months or (2) make a statement that an estimate of the range cannot be made. As well as removing the requirement to disclose the cumulative amount of each type of temporary difference when a deferred tax liability is not recognized because of the exceptions to comprehensive recognition of deferred taxes related to subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have\n73\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nnot yet been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments in this update should be applied on a prospective basis and retrospective application is permitted. The Company does not believe this accounting standard update will have material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this accounting standard update will have on our footnote disclosures.\n3 Revenue Recognition\nThe Company’s deferred revenue liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period.\nThe following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s deferred revenue and customer advances for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nThe Company classified $\n67\nmillion and $\n57\nmillion of deferred revenue and customer advances in other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe amount of deferred revenue and customer advances equals the transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligations for the period presented. Such amounts are expected to be recognized in the future as follows (in thousands):\n4 Marketable Securities\nThe Company’s marketable securities within cash equivalents and investments included in the consolidated balance sheets consist of time deposits that mature in one year or less with an amortized cost and a fair value of $\n0.9\nmillion at both December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n74\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n5 Inventories\nInventories are classified as follows (in thousands):\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded inventory-related excess and obsolescence provisions of $\n11\nmillion, $\n14\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion, respectively.\n6 Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company retired and disposed of approximately $\n48\nmillion, $\n24\nmillion and $\n23\nmillion of property, plant and equipment, respectively, most of which was fully depreciated and no longer in use.\nGains or losses on disposals were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n7 Acquisitions\nOn May 16, 2023, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Wyatt for $\n1.3\nbillion, net of cash acquired. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories and services. The acquisition will expand Waters portfolio and increase exposure to large molecule applications. As a result of the acquisition, the results of Wyatt are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nThe Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation was based upon preliminary information and is subject to change if additional information about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date becomes available. The Company is in the ongoing process of conducting a valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the acquisition. The final fair value of the net assets acquired may result in adjustments to these assets and liabilities, including goodwill.\nThe intangible assets were valued with input from valuation specialists. The Company used variations of the income approach, which uses Level 3 inputs, in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the\n75\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nWyatt acquisition. Specifically, the customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. The Company utilized the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of the tradename and the developed technology.\nThe following table presents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the closing date of May 16, 2023 (in thousands):\nThe details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired and the estimated useful lives are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThe Company allocated $\n864\nmillion of the purchase price to goodwill which is primarily deductible for tax purposes and has been allocated to the Waters Division operating segment. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the value of intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition such as workforce in place and cash flows from the integration of acquired technology, distribution channels and products with the Company’s products, which are higher than if the acquired companies’ technology, customer access or products were utilized on a stand-alone basis.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s consolidated results included net sales of $\n73\nmillion, and a net operating loss of $\n18\nmillion since the acquisition closed on May 16, 2023. The Company also incurred transaction related costs of $\n13\nmillion during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, which are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.\n76\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only. It is not necessarily indicative of the actual results of operations that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single company as of January 1, 2022 or the future operating results of the combined entity. The unaudited pro forma information does not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, regulatory matters or any anticipated synergies that may be associated with the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma information also does not include any integration costs that the Company may incur related to the acquisition as part of combining the operations of the companies.\nThe following unaudited pro forma information shows the results of the Company’s operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022 (in thousands):\nTo reflect the acquisition of Wyatt as if it had occurred on January 1, 2022, the unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments to reflect, among other things, the incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on the preliminary values of each identifiable intangible asset of Wyatt and the interest expense from debt financings obtained to partially fund the cash consideration transferred. Pro forma adjustments were tax effected at the Company’s historical statutory rates in effect for the respective periods.\nPro forma net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was adjusted to exclude certain\nnon-recurring\nexpenses related to transaction costs incurred and the fair value adjustment of inventory. These\nnon-recurring\nexpenses were reclassified to the prior period and included in the pro forma net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\nIn conjunction with the Wyatt acquisition, the Company entered into retention agreements with certain employees, in which the Company agreed to pay a total of $\n40\nmillion, in two equal installments upon the first and second anniversary of the acquisition date. As these employees are earning their individual cash award by providing service over the\ntwo-year\nperiod that benefit the Company, the $\n40\nmillion will be recognized within total costs and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations over the\ntwo-year\nservice period. The Company has recorded $\n19\nmillion of expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOn January 31, 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the charge detection mass spectrometry technology (“CDMS technology”) assets of Megadalton Solutions, Inc. (“Megadalton”) were acquired for approximately $\n10\nmillion in total purchase price, of which $\n5\nmillion was paid at closing and\nthe remaining\n$\n4\nmillion will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. This CDMS technology makes it possible to analyze extremely large proteins and protein complexes used in cell and gene therapies that would otherwise be difficult to analyze with conventional mass spectrometry. Once this technology is further developed, it will extend the capabilities of our mass spectrometry portfolio for a broader set of applications, and as such, the cost of this technology asset has been accounted for as Acquired\nIn-Process Research\nand Development and expensed in costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations.\n8 Goodwill and Other Intangibles\nThe carrying amount of goodwill was $\n1.3\nbillion and $\n430\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The acquisition of Wyatt increased goodwill by $\n864\nmillion, while the effect of foreign currency translation increased goodwill by $\n10\nmillion.\n77\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Company’s intangible assets included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThe Company capitalized $\n468\nmillion, $\n54\nmillion and $\n55\nmillion of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets increased by $\n32\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2023 due to the effects of foreign currency translation. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $\n81\nmillion, $\n58\nmillion and $\n60\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2023, the company wrote off a $\n4\nmillion intangible asset that was fully amortized. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $\n98\nmillion per year for each of the next five years.\n9 Debt\nOn May 16, 2023, the Company financed the Wyatt acquisition with a combination of cash on its balance sheet and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. As a result of the Wyatt transaction, the Company’s outstanding debt on December 31, 2023 was $\n2.4\nbillion.\nOn May 11, 2023, the Company issued the following senior unsecured notes:\nThe Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Series P and Q Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The Company may prepay some or all of the Senior Notes, at any time and from time to time, in an amount not less than\n10\n% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount for Series P and Q Senior Notes, in each case, upon no more than 60 nor less than 20 days’ written notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the note purchase agreement) of the Company, the Company may be required to prepay the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Other provisions for these senior unsecured notes are similar to the existing senior unsecured notes, as described below.\nThe Company ha\ns\na\nfive-year\n, $\n1.8\nbillion revolving facility (the “Credit Facility”) that expires in September 2026. On March 3, 2023, the Company amended the Credit Facility to increase the borrowing capacity by $\n200\nmillion to an aggregate total borrowing capacity of $\n2.0\nbillion, which did not affect\nthe\nmaturity\ndate of September 17, 2026. The amendment also replaced all references in the Credit Facility to LIBOR with Term SOFR as the benchmark rate. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Credit Facility had a total of $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n270\nmillion outstanding,\nrespectively.\n78\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe interest rates applicable under the Credit Facility are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted Term SOFR rate for a\none-month\ninterest period as published two U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to such day (or if such day is not a U.S. Government Securities Business Day, the immediately preceding U.S. Government Securities Business Day), plus 1% annum) or the applicable 1, 3 or 6 month adjusted Term SOFR or EURIBO rate for euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for Term SOFR or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the Credit Facility ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan.\nThe Credit Facility requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than\n3.50\n:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than\n3.50\n:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the Credit Facility includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities.\nAs of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a total of $\n1.3\nbillion of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly.\nThe Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than\n10\n% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal\nto 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThese senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default.\nThe Company had the following outstanding debt at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n79\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the Credit Facility of $\n0.9\nbillion and $\n1.5\nbillion, respectively, after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were\n4.69\n% and\n3.54\n% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.\nThe Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $\n114\nmillion and $\n113\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. None of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 202\n2.\nAnnual maturities of debt outstanding at December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\n10 Income Taxes\nIncome tax data for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in thousands):\n80\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe differences between income taxes computed at the United States statutory rate and the provision for income taxes are summarized as follows for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was\n12.8\n%,\n15.5\n% and\n14.1\n% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the Company’s effective tax rate in 2023 can primarily be attributed to the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit of $\n18\nmillion as a result of the completion of a tax examination, decreasing the Company’s 2023 effective tax rate by approximately\n2.5\n%.\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to differences in the proportionate amounts of\npre-tax\nincome recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates and the items discussed below.\nThe four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland,\nthe\nU.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were\n21\n%,\n12.5\n%,\n25\n% and\n17\n%, respectively, as of December 31,\n2023.\nThe\nCompany has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of\n5\n% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. Prior to April 1, 2021, the Company had a tax exemption on income arising from qualifying activities in Singapore based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company met as of December 31, 2020 and maintained through March 2021. The effect of applying these concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income arising from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income by $\n16\nmillion, $\n20\nmillion and $\n20\nmillion and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $\n0.27\n, $\n0.33\nand $\n0.32\nfor the year\ns\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDuring 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate differed from the\n21\n% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, an $\n18\nmillion recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit as a result of the completion of a tax examination, a $\n15\nmillion provision related to the GILTI tax, including the impact of capitalizing research and development expenditures pursuant to IRC Section 174, and a tax benefit of $\n3\nmillion on stock-based compensation.\nThe 2022 effective tax rate differed from the\n21\n% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, a $\n18\nmillion provision related to the GILTI tax and a tax benefit of $\n7\nmillion on stock-based compensation.\nThe 2021 effective tax rate differed from the\n21\n% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, an $\n10\nmillion provision related to the GILTI tax and a tax benefit of $\n7\nmillion on stock-based\ncompensation.\nThe Company recorded a tax provision of $\n4\nmillion, $\n4\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for future withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes on the repatriation of 2023, 2022 and 2021 undistributed earnings.\n8\n1\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards which give rise to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nThe Company has gross foreign net operating losses of $\n231\nmillion, of which $\n192\nmillion do not expire under current laws and $\n39\nmillion start expiring in 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of $\n58\nmillion, of which $\n52\nmillion relates to certain foreign net operating losses. The Company’s net deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are approximately $\n3\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, which represent the future tax benefit of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that do not expire under current law.\nThe Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money.\nThe Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n8\n2\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nAs of 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $\n14\nmillion, all of which, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. This represents a decrease of $\n18\nmillion resulting from the completion of a tax audit in 2023. This decrease reduced the income tax expense in the statement of operations and did not impact cash\nflows. The Company is subject to various foreign audits and inquiries, and we currently do not expect any material adjustments.\nWith limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2018. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company expects to record additional reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of approximately $\n2\nmillion within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.\nThe following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\n11 Litigation\nFrom time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company executed a settlement agreement to resolve patent infringement litigation with Bruker Corporation and Bruker Daltronik\n8\n3\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nGmbH regarding their timsTOF product line. In connection with the settlement, the Company is entitled to receive $\n10\nmillion in guaranteed payments, including minimum royalty payments, which was recognized within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company received $\n2\nmillion, $\n1\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion, respectively, in guaranteed payments, net of applicable withholding taxes. The Company also recorded a litigation provision of $\n5\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021, related to a legal settlement.\n12 Leases\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2034, with weighted-average remaining lease terms of\n4.5\nyears and\n4.4\nyears, respectively. Rental expense was $\n38\nmillion, $\n36\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average discount rates used to determine the present value of lease liabilities were\n4.15\n% and\n3.24\n%, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities in operating activities in the statement of cash flows was $\n38\nmillion, $\n36\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion, respectively.\nT\nhe Company\nrecorded\n$\n2\nmillion\n,\n$\n12\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion of\nright-of-use\nassets in exchange for new operating lease liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company’s\nright-of-use\nlease assets and lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands):\n8\n4\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nUndiscounted future minimum rents payable as of December 31, 2023 under\nnon-cancelable\nleases with initial terms exceeding one year reconcile to lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet as follows (in thousands):\n13 Other Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties in the course of ordinary business.\nFuture minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2023 are immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023 and thereafter.\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.\n14 Stock-Based Compensation\nIn May 2020, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). As of December 31, 2023, the 2020 Plan has\n6.3\nmillion shares available for grant in the form of incentive or\nnon-qualified\nstock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options, restricted stock unit conversion or performance stock unit conversion. Under the 2020 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2020 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 13, 2030. Options generally will expire no later than\nten years\nafter the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a\nfive-year\nperiod. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units may be issued under the 2020 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had stock\noptions\n, restricted stock and restricted and performance stock unit awards o\nutstanding.\nIn May 2009, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which eligible employees may contribute up\nto\n15\n% of their earnings toward the quarterly purchase of the\nCompany’s\n85\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\ncommon stock.\nThe plan makes available\n0.8\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock, which includes the remaining shares available under the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2023,\n1.7\nmillion shares have been issued under both the 2009 and 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plans. Each plan period lasts\nthree months\nbeginning on January\n1\n, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year.\nThe purchase price for each share of stock is the lesser of 90% of the market price on the first day of the plan period or 100% of the market price on the last day of the plan period.\nStock-based compensation expense related to this plan was $\n1\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period.\nThe consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands):\nStock Options\nIn determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of\nnon-qualified\nstock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury\nzero-coupon\nissues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model.\nThe relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n86\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\nThe following table details the options outstanding at December 31, 2023 by range of exercise prices (in thousands, except per share data):\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, the total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised (i.e., the difference between the market price at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the options) was $\n11\nmillion, $\n31\nmillion and $\n43\nmillion, respectively. The total cash received from the exercise of these stock options was $\n18\nmillion, $\n32\nmillion and $\n46\nmillion for the year\ns\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding stock options at December 31, 2023 was $\n39\nmillion. There were\n0.3\nmillion options exercisable at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The weighted-average exercise prices of options exercisable at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $\n223.37\n, $\n188.21\nand $\n162.09\n, respectively. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of the exercisable outstanding stock options at December 31, 2023 was\n5.1\nyears. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2023 was $\n28\nmillion.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had\n0.6\nmillion stock options that are vested and expected to vest. The intrinsic value, weighted-average exercise price and remaining contractual life of the vested and expected to vest stock options were $\n39\nmillion, $\n264.78\nand\n6.7\nyears, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\nThe amount of compensation costs recognized for the year\ns\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 on the stock options expected to vest were $\n10\nmillion, $\n8\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there were $\n25\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock option awards that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n3.4\nyears.\n87\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nRestricted Stock\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted\nthree\nthousand,\nthree\nthousand and\nfour\nthousand shares of restricted stock, respectively. The weighted-average fair value per share on the grant date of the restricted stock granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n341.04\n, $\n363.44\nand $\n256.28\n, respectively. The Company has recorded $\n1\nmillion of compensation expense in each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 related to the restricted stock grants. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had\nthree\nthousand unvested shares of restricted stock outstanding, which have been fully expensed.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\nRestricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a\nfive-year\nperiod. The amount of compensation costs recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 on the restricted stock units expected to vest were $\n19\nmillion, $\n19\nmillion and $\n17\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there were $\n50\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the restricted stock unit awards that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n3.3\nyears\n.\nPerformance Stock Units\nThe Company’s\nperformance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target shares awarded. Beginning with the grants made in 2020, the vesting conditions for performance stock units now include a performance condition based on future sales growth.\nIn determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, includ\ning vola\ntility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury\nzero-coupon\nissues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period.\nThe relevant data used to determine\n88\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nthe value of\nthe performance stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nThe following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\nThe amount of compensation costs recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 on the performance stock units expected to vest were $\n5\nmillion, $\n13\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there were $\n15\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the performance stock unit awards that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.9\nyears.\n15  Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\n89\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nFor the year\ns\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company had\n245\nthousand,\n66\nthousand and\n3\nthousand stock options that were antidilutive, respectively, due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury\nstock method.\n16  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are detailed as follows\n(in thousands):\n17  Retirement Plans\nU.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters Employee Investment Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution plan, immediately upon hire. Employees may contribute up to\n60\n% of eligible pay on a\npre-tax\nor\npost-tax\nbasis and the Company makes matching contributions of\n100\n% for contributions up to\n6\n% of eligible pay. The Company also sponsors a 401(k) Restoration Plan, which is a nonqualified defined contribution plan. Employees are\n100\n% vested in employee and Company matching contributions for both plans. For the year\ns\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s matching contributions amounted to $\n22\nmillion, $\n21\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company also sponsors other employee benefit plans in the U.S., including a retiree healthcare plan, which provides reimbursement for medical expenses and is contributory. There are various employee benefit plans outside the United States (both defined benefit and defined contribution plans). Certain\nnon-U.S.\ndefined benefit plans\n(“Non-U.S.\nPension Plans”) are included in the disclosures below, which are required under the accounting standards for retirement benefits.\nThe Company contributed $\n18\nmillion, $\n16\nmillion and $\n17\nmillion in the year\ns\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to the\nnon-U.S.\nplans (primarily defined contribution plans) which are currently outside of the scope of the required disclosures. The eligibility and vesting of\nnon-U.S. plans\nare consistent with local laws\nand regulations.\n90\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS\n— (Continued)\nThe net periodic pension cost\nis made up of several components that reflect different aspects of the Company’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits earned by employees. These components are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method and are based on certain actuarial assumptions. The Company’s accounting policy is to reflect in the projected benefit obligation all benefit changes to which the Company is committed as of the current valuation date; use a market-related value of assets to determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the expected future service of active participants as of the date such costs are first recognized; and\namortize cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation over the expected future service of active participants.\nSummary data for the U.S. Retiree Healthcare Plan and\nNon-U.S. Pension\nPlans are presented in the following tables, using the measurement dates of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe reconciliation of the projected benefit obligations for the plans at December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows\n(in thousands):\nThe reconciliation of the fair value of the plan assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\n91\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe summary of the funded status for the plans at December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\nThe change in the Company’s projected benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to net actuarial losses that arose during the year driven by a decrease in discount rates, differences between expected and actual return on plan assets, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the year. The change in the Company’s projected benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to net actuarial gains that arose during the year driven by an increase in discount rates, differences between expected and actual return on plan assets, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the year.\nThe summary of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets for the plans at December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in\nthousands):\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n81\nmillion and $\n64\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe summary of the\nNon-U.S.\nPension Plans that have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\nThe summary of the\nNon-U.S.\nPension Plans that have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\n92\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe summary of the components\nof net periodic pension costs for the plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in thousands):\nThe summary of the changes in amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in thousands):\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost component are included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe summary of the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity for the plans at December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\n93\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe plans’ investment asset mix is as follows at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThe plans’ investment policies include the following asset allocation guidelines:\nThe asset allocation policy for the U.S. Retiree Healthcare Plan was developed in consideration of the following long-term investment objectives: achieving a return on assets consistent with the investment policy, achieving portfolio returns which compare favorably with those of other similar plans, professionally managed portfolios and of appropriate market indexes and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations of the plan. Within the equity portfolio of the U.S. Retiree Healthcare Plan,\ninvestments are diversified among market capitalization and investment strategy, and targets a 45% allocation of the equity portfolio to be invested in financial markets outside of the United States.\nThe Company does not invest in its own stock within the U.S. Retiree Healthcare Plan’s assets.\nPlan assets are measured at fair value using the following valuation techniques and inputs:\nThere have been no changes in the above valuation techniques associated with determining the value of the plans’ assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n94\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe fair value of the Company’s retirement plan assets are as follows at December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nThe fair value of the Company’s retirement plan assets are as follows at December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\n95\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the Level 3 retirement plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands)\n:\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nTo develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered historical returns and future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio and historical expenses paid by the plan. A\none-quarter\npercentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate of return on assets would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost by\nless than $1 million\n. A\none-quarter\npercentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost by\nless than $1 million\n.\n9\n6\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nDuring\nfiscal year 2024, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $\n3\nmillion to $\n6\nmillion to the Company’s defined benefit plans.

They also establish standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company’s business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has\ntwo\noperating segments: Waters and TA.\nThe Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into\none\nreporting segment for financial statement purposes.
