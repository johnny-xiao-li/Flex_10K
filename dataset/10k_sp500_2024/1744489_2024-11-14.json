During fiscal 2025, we expect to release approximately 15 films.\n5\nThe Company incurs significant marketing and advertising costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film in an effort to generate public awareness of the film, to increase the public’s intent to view the film and to help generate consumer interest in the subsequent home entertainment and other ancillary markets.

The products include children’s books and comic books.\n13\nCompetition and Seasonality\nThe Company’s theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.\nAll of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. In addition, theme park and resort revenues may be higher during significant celebrations such as theme park or character anniversaries and lower in the periods following such celebrations. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.\nSTAR INDIA TRANSACTION\nThe Company and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) plan to close a transaction on or about November 14, 2024, which will form a joint venture that combines our Star-branded and other general entertainment and sports television channels and direct-to-consumer Disney+ Hotstar service in India (Star India) and certain media and entertainment businesses controlled by RIL (the Star India Transaction) (see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nThe Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit and perquisite programs; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of the Company’s content, products and experiences; and evolve and invest in technology, tools and resources to enable employees at work.\nThe Company employed approximately 233,000 people as of September 28, 2024, of which approximately 171,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 62,000 were employed outside the U.S. Our global workforce comprises approximately 76% full time and 16% part time employees, with another 8% being seasonal employees. A significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses, including employees of our theme parks, and writers, directors, actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, some of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by works councils, trade unions or other employee associations.\nSome of our key programs and initiatives to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n•\nHealth, financial, family resources, well-being and other benefits:\nDisney’s benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of our diverse employees and their families. These benefit offerings for eligible employees include:\n◦\nHealthcare options aimed at improving quality of care while limiting out-of-pocket costs\n◦\nRetirement and savings programs that help employees adapt to changing needs and unexpected events and drive financial security in the present and the future\n◦\nFamily care resources, such as childcare and senior care programs, long-term care coverage and a family building benefit\n◦\nPaid time-off programs, including vacation and sick and family care leave\n◦\nFree mental health and well-being resources\n◦\nGlobal well-being programs, including in-person offerings through campus health clubs and virtual and onsite events and activities focused on physical, emotional, financial and social well-being\n◦\nTwo Centers for Living Well in the Orlando area that offer convenient, on-demand access to board-certified physicians and counselors\n14\n•\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI):\nOur DEI objectives are to build and sustain teams that reflect the life experiences of our audiences, while employing and supporting a diverse array of voices in our creative and production teams. Some of our DEI initiatives and programs are:\n◦\nExecutive incubator program and creative talent development program designed to engage the next generation of creative executives from underrepresented backgrounds\n◦\nHeroes Work Here, an initiative to hire, train and support U.S. military veterans\n◦\nOver 100 employee-led groups, which represent and support the diverse communities that make up our global workforce\n•\nTalent Development and Education:\nWe invest in creating opportunities to help employees grow and build their careers through training, professional development and educational programs.\n◦\nOur training and professional development programs are presented in online, instructor-led and on-the-job learning formats, including Career@Disney: INTERACTIVE, a new series of immersive virtual and in-person experiences designed to aid employees in enhancing their careers\n◦\nOur education investment program, Disney Aspire, offers assistance for tuition, books and fees to eligible participating employees at a variety of in-network learning providers and universities at levels ranging from high school completion to undergraduate degrees. At the end of fiscal 2024, more than 12,000 current employees were enrolled and more than 5,000 current employees had graduated since the program launched in 2018.\n•\nSocial Impact:\nThe Company has a longstanding commitment to social impact by supporting communities through our philanthropic efforts, including through our support of wish granting and children’s hospitals and our efforts to support communities in which we operate and the contributions of our employees. The Company supports employees who make monetary donations to eligible nonprofits with a generous U.S. matching gifts program. In addition, through the Disney VoluntEARS program, we encourage employees to donate their time and talents to their local communities and provide grants that allow eligible employees to direct donations from the Company to nonprofits of their choosing as a benefit for the time they spend volunteering.\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\nThe Company has developed measurable environmental sustainability goals for 2030, based on our assessment of where the Company’s operations have the most significant environmental impacts and where we can most effectively mitigate those impacts. The Company’s goals encompass science-based targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, water stewardship, waste reduction, sustainable design in construction and use of more sustainable materials in our products.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\nThe Company’s businesses throughout the world are affected by its ability to exploit and protect against infringement of its IP, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. Important IP includes rights in the content of motion pictures, television programs, electronic games, sound recordings, character likenesses, theme park attractions, books and magazines and merchandise. Risks related to the protection and exploitation of IP rights and information concerning the expiration of certain of our copyrights are set forth in Item 1A – Risk Factors.\nREGULATION\nFederal Communications Commission Regulation\nTelevision broadcasting is subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under federal laws and regulations, including the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. FCC regulations that affect linear channels include the following:\n•\nLicensing of television stations\n. Each of the television stations we own must be licensed by the FCC. These licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years, and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations. We (and the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture) must also obtain FCC approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station. The FCC may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances and may delay renewals while permitting a licensee to continue operating. Although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past or have been permitted to continue operations when renewal is delayed, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future.\n15\n•\nStation ownership limits\n. The FCC imposes limitations on the number of television stations and radio stations an entity can own in a specific market, on the combined number of television and radio stations an entity can own in a single market and on the aggregate percentage of the national audience that can be reached by television stations. Currently:\n◦\nFCC regulations may restrict our ability to own more than one television station in a market, depending on the size and nature of the market. We do not own more than one television station in any market.\n◦\nFederal statutes permit our television stations in the aggregate to reach a maximum of 39% of the national audience. Pursuant to the most recent decision by the FCC as to how to calculate compliance with this limit, our eight stations reach approximately 20% of the national audience.\n•\nDual networks\n. FCC rules currently prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC — from being under common ownership or control.\n•\nForeign ownership\n. The Communications Act generally restricts foreign individuals or entities from collectively owning more than 25% of the voting or equity interest in a U.S. entity that controls a broadcast television license. FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold.\n•\nRegulation of programming\n. The FCC regulates broadcast programming by, among other things, banning “indecent” programming, regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during children’s programming. Penalties for broadcasting indecent programming can be over $400,000 per indecent utterance or image per station.\nFederal legislation and FCC rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, broadcast stations are generally required to provide an average of three hours per week of programming that has as a “significant purpose” meeting the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance.\n•\nCable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations.\nWith respect to MVPDs operating within a television station’s Designated Market Area, FCC rules require that every three years each television station elect either “must carry” status, pursuant to which MVPDs generally must carry a local television station in the station’s market, or “retransmission consent” status, pursuant to which the MVPDs must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal. The ABC owned television stations have historically elected retransmission consent.\n•\nCable and satellite carriage of programming.\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules regulate some aspects of negotiations between programmers and distributors regarding the carriage of networks by cable and satellite distribution companies, and some cable and satellite distribution companies have sought regulation of additional aspects of the carriage of programming on their systems. New legislation, court action or regulation in this area could have an impact on the Company’s operations.\nThe foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, other legislation and specific FCC rules and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, other legislation, FCC rules and public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of the FCC’s regulatory authority.\nFCC laws and regulations are subject to change, and the Company generally cannot predict whether new legislation, court action or regulations, or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations, would have an adverse impact on our operations.\nPrivacy and Data Protection Regulation\nOur businesses are subject to various privacy and data protection laws and regulations in most of the domestic and international jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. Those laws and regulations govern our use, collection, storage, retention and sharing of personal information and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including within the U.S. at the federal level and among the 50 states. This patchwork of domestic and international laws creates different obligations that are, at times, inconsistent with one another.\nWhile there is no comprehensive privacy law in the U.S. at the federal level, there are a number of sector-specific federal privacy laws applicable to our operations, such as the Video Privacy Protection Act, which restricts the ability to share personal information along with specific viewing information with third parties. In addition, various U.S. states, including California, have passed comprehensive data privacy laws that establish various consumer rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information with third parties, to gain access to the personal information that companies hold about them, to delete personal information and to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive information. We are also subject to privacy legal and regulatory requirements in many jurisdictions outside the United States, including the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and similar comprehensive data privacy legislation in\n16\nthe UK. These laws require organizations that process the personal data of EU and UK citizens to comply with certain data protection standards and privacy rights, including requirements to implement privacy by design; parental consent for processing children’s data; detailed privacy notices and related consents; breach notifications; and data subject rights to enforce access, rectification, objection, restriction, portability and deletion.\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that are intended to protect the privacy of children online, including the Children’s Online Protection Privacy Act, a U.S. federal law that requires websites and online services to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13, as well as codes of conduct relating to the design of digital products and services likely to be accessed by children, such as the UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code. These laws, regulations and codes of conduct have an impact on the marketing of our products and services, the advertising on certain of our and third-party digital platforms that distribute our content and the design of certain of our new media offerings.\nIn addition, U.S. state laws and many international data protection laws require notifications to consumers and regulators in the event of a data breach, mandating that businesses provide consumers and/or government agencies notice of unauthorized access or disclosure of certain information.\nInterpretation of privacy and data protection laws and enforcement priorities continue to evolve and in some cases, regulators seek to apply novel interpretations of existing laws.\nCompliance with privacy and data protection laws and regulations entails significant investments and is costly and requires us to employ dedicated compliance personnel and processes. In addition, many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines, private rights of action for damages and other relief.\nInternational Content Regulation\nThe laws and regulations in many international jurisdictions in which we operate, including in the EU and Canada, require our linear networks or our DTC streaming services to include a certain amount of programming produced in specific jurisdictions or languages or require us to invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content or to acquire content produced by local independent production companies. In addition, some countries regulate the content of films and television programming, which can impact our ability to distribute certain content in those jurisdictions or can require us to make adjustments to the films or programming. These laws and regulations increase our costs and impact our ability to operate our DTC streaming services and linear networks and distribute our films and programming in these markets.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available without charge on our website, www.disney.com/investors, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nWe also use our Investor Relations website as a means of disclosing material non-public information. We may also use our Investor Relations website for the purpose of complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Disney to review the information we post on our Investor Relations website.\nWe are providing the address to our website solely for the information of investors. We do not intend our website address to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate the contents of the website into this report."

    "text": "For an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRY\nDeclines in U.S., global and regional economic conditions adversely affect the profitability of our businesses.\nDeclines in economic conditions, such as recessions, other less severe slowdowns in economic activity and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business typically adversely affect demand for our products and services and/or costs to operate our businesses, reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced or resulted in slower growth than expected in, among other things, guest spending at our parks and resorts, purchases of and prices for advertising on our platforms and purchases of Company-branded consumer products, and we expect similar impacts as such conditions recur. Recent inflationary conditions increased certain of our costs, including at our parks\n17\nand resorts. While a number of different factors affect the demand for our products and services, actual or perceived economic conditions could contribute to lower attendance or spending at our parks and experiences businesses, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products and linear platforms, subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC platforms or licensing fees, while also continuing to increase the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Even if inflationary pressures moderate, we expect certain costs, such as for labor, to remain elevated. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and experiences we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs, including borrowing costs as a result of elevated interest rates, making it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations and investments on favorable terms. A decline in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated could impact implementation or success of our business plans, such as our plans to increase investment in our Experiences segment, the realignment of our cost structure and plans for our DTC ad-supported services, enhancements, pricing structure and price increases. Unfavorable economic conditions also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. The adverse impact on our businesses of actual or perceived declines in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated will depend, in part, on their severity and duration and our ability to mitigate these impacts on our businesses is limited.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses, including by impacting the cost in U.S. dollars of providing our goods and services, our revenues in U.S. dollars generated by our international businesses and the international demand for our domestic products and services. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar adversely impacts the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and contributes to reduced international demand for our domestic products and services, including international travel to our domestic parks and resorts. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar often increases the cost of labor, goods and services in, or originating from, non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in certain countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries.\nChanges in technology, in consumer consumption patterns and in how entertainment products are created affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products and the cost of producing or distributing these products.\nThe media entertainment and technology businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to new technologies including shifting patterns of content consumption and how entertainment products are generated. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. These developments have impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast and cable television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels. These developments have decreased advertising and affiliate revenue at some of our linear networks and have led, and may lead in the future, to the impairment of the value of certain of our assets. In addition, theater-going to watch movies has remained below pre-pandemic levels.\nRules governing new technological developments, such as developments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI and large language model tools, remain unsettled, and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model, including revenue streams for the use of our IP, how we create our entertainment products and the competition we face. In order to respond to the impact of new technologies on our businesses, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement new initiatives and changes to our business models, including by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, reorganizing our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies and developing new media offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, new media offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to technological changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution impacts the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. As part of our DTC strategy, we forgo certain revenue from certain traditional sources as we invest in our DTC offerings. Since launch, our DTC streaming services experienced significant losses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will each be or remain profitable or be as profitable over the long term as our historic business models.\n18\nWe face risks relating to misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment, travel and consumer products, which impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and the profitability of our businesses.\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently produce compelling creative content, which may be distributed, among other ways, through DTC platforms, broadcast, cable, theaters and used in theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products. Such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks, resorts, cruise ships and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences. Demand for certain out-of-home entertainment experiences, such as theater-going to watch movies, has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, many of our businesses depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the U.S. The success of our businesses therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to continually evolving consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the U.S. Moreover, we must often make substantial investments in content production and acquisition, acquisition of sports and programming rights, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other facilities or customer facing platforms before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance, and the market, economic or social conditions are sometimes significantly different from the ones we anticipated at the time of the investment decisions. Further, preferences of some consumers are affected by their perceptions of our position on matters of public interest, including regarding environmental and social issues. Generally, revenues from, and profitability of, each of our businesses are adversely impacted when our entertainment offerings and products, as well as our methods to make our offerings and products available to consumers, do not align with constantly evolving consumer preferences and tastes or achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\nA variety of uncontrollable events disrupt our businesses, reduce demand for or consumption of our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost or reduce the profitability of providing our products and services.\nThe operation and profitability of our businesses and demand for and consumption of our products and services, particularly our parks and experiences businesses, are highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, including in the specific regions in which our parks and experiences businesses operate. In addition, we have extensive international operations, including our international theme parks and resorts, which are dependent on domestic and international regulations consistent with trade and investment in those regions. The operation of our businesses and the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for and consumption of our other entertainment products, is subject to significant adverse impact in the U.S., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: health concerns; adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term climate change, including longer and more regular excessive heat conditions, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, droughts, tsunamis and earthquakes); international, political or military developments, including trade and other international disputes and social unrest; macroeconomic conditions, including a decline in economic activity, inflation and foreign exchange rates; and terrorist attacks. These events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs, supply chain disruptions and malware and other cyber-related attacks or intrusions or other widespread computing, telecommunications or payment processing failures, from time to time have disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our ability to provide our products and services or in certain instances may affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage with respect to some of these events. An incident or other event that affected our property directly, including a security incident, earthquake or hurricane, would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could result in closure of impacted operations or have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities. Moreover, the costs of protecting against such incidents reduces the profitability of our operations.\nFor example, COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our businesses in a number of ways, including the closure of our theme parks and resorts, suspension of cruise ship sailings and guided tours, delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled, theatrical releases and disruptions in the production and availability of content, significantly reducing revenues across all of our segments. Certain of our business operations have been temporarily disrupted by payment processing outages and widespread computing failures. Hurricanes, such as Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which in the case of Hurricane Milton caused Walt Disney World Resort theme parks in Florida to close for one full and partial day, have impacted the operations and profitability of Walt Disney World Resort and may do so in the future. The Company has paused certain operations in certain regions, including in response to sanctions, trade restrictions and related developments and the profitability of certain operations has been impacted as a result of events in the corresponding regions.\nIn addition, we derive affiliate fees and royalties from the distribution of our programming, sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties, and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the Company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. The profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely impacted by the significant contraction of distribution channels for our products and services,\n19\nincluding through third-party licensees or sellers of our licensed goods and services. In addition, third-party suppliers provide products and services essential to the operation of a number of our businesses. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties or materially impacted a supplier of a significant product or service, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected. In specific geographic markets, we have experienced delayed and/or partial payments from certain third parties due to liquidity issues.\nWe obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including certain physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we experience losses not covered by our insurance, which could be material.\nWe face risks related to changes in our business strategy, which have affected and may continue to affect our cost structure, the profitability of our businesses and/or the value of our assets.\nWe adjust our business strategies from time to time in connection with changes in senior management and in our efforts to respond to changes in technology, consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, acceptance of our entertainment offerings, the market for advertising, macroeconomic conditions and other changes in the business environment. For example, in fiscal 2024, we announced entering into a definitive agreement to transfer Star India into a joint venture and related impairment charges; in fiscal 2023, we reorganized our media and entertainment operations, which had been previously reported in one segment, into two segments, Entertainment and Sports; in fiscal 2023 we announced that we would review content, primarily on our DTC services, for alignment with a strategic change in our approach to content curation, resulting in removal of certain content from our platforms and related impairment charges; in fiscal 2022, we announced plans to introduce an ad-supported Disney+ service, new pricing model and price increases and cost realignment; and we have announced exploration of a number of new types of businesses. Changes in strategy, such as was the case with the most recent reorganization of our media and entertainment operations, can lead to workforce disruptions. Our new business strategies are, among other things, subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits, such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value. For example, notwithstanding our continuing efforts to rationalize costs, the cost of executing on our DTC strategy may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which may impact our distribution strategy across businesses/distribution platforms, the types of content we distribute through various businesses/distribution platforms, the timing and sequencing of content windows and ultimately, the profitability of our DTC products and other businesses/distribution platforms. Over the long term, our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies.\nIn addition, changing technology, consumer purchasing patterns and acceptance of content offerings and macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. We incur costs in connection with changes to our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to write-down the value of our assets. Among other assets, we have impaired the value of our content primarily at our DTC services and goodwill and intangible assets at our linear networks and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets. We may write down other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the business environment.\nWe also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. For example, in fiscal 2024, we announced plans for additional expansion of our fleet of cruise ships, and in recent years to expand investment in our Experiences segment. In addition, in recent years, we have made significant investments in our businesses, such as expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks, additional cruise ships, the acquisition of TFCF Corporation (TFCF) and investments related to DTC offerings. The ultimate success of these investments is uncertain, some of these and future investments may ultimately result in returns that are negative or lower than anticipated, and these investments may impact the resources available to, and the profitability of, our other businesses. In addition, our costs increase in connection with these investments, such as additional expenses incurred with the launch on new cruise ships, and we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets if the investments are not as successful as anticipated, as occurred in connection with the closure of Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser. Even if our strategies are effective in the long term, our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term, results of our new offerings are unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not expand into new markets as or when anticipated. Our ability to forecast for new businesses is impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses, speed with which the competitive landscape changes, volatility beyond our control (such as the events beyond our control noted above) and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based. Accordingly, we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes.\n20\nIncreased competitive pressures impact our revenues, increase our costs and impact the profitability of our businesses.\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n•\nOur programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n•\nOur television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n•\nOur television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n•\nOur theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n•\nOur content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n•\nOur consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n•\nOur DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors’ DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\nWe face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience. For example, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor’s subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. There can be\n21\nno assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.\nWe face risks related to environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations.\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to environmental, social and governance matters, including environmental sustainability, climate change, human rights and human capital management, have been adopted or are under consideration, some of which include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response has increased our compliance costs, including from increased investment in technology and appropriate expertise and required the implementation of new reporting processes, entailing additional compliance risk.\nIn addition, we have undertaken or announced a number of related actions and goals, which will require changes to operations and ongoing investment. There is no assurance that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes or that we will achieve any of these goals. Consumer, government and other stakeholder perceptions of our initiatives often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain environmental sustainability goals or initiatives will depend in part on third-party collaboration, the availability of suppliers that can satisfy new requirements, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\nWe face risks related to damage to our reputation or brands.\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, some types of damage to our reputation or brands have an impact on all of our businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, some types of brand damage are not locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors, including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture, which may be amplified by social media, adversely impact our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\nVarious risks may impact the success of our DTC streaming services.\nThe success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC streaming services will be impacted by the success of the reorganization of our media and entertainment business and the strategic change in our approach to content curation initiated in fiscal 2023; our ability to drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn, achieve the desired financial impact of our DTC pricing, bundling and distribution determinations, the Disney+ ad supported service, monetization and cost containment strategy and the launch of the ESPN flagship DTC service; and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the business of initial exploitation, and amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights are generally allocated across businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business, including the applicable DTC service. There are a number of competing DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by challenging economic conditions, such as during periods of high inflation or declines in economic activity. In addition, such economic conditions negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and sports and other programming rights and are sometimes not successful in recruiting and retaining talent and obtaining desired programming rights and face increased costs to do so. We have experienced flat subscriber growth or net losses of subscribers in periods. Our content does not always successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations as well as government-imposed content restrictions, impacts the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or lead to higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC streaming services.\nPotential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\nOur borrowing costs have been and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company’s performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. Our elevated indebtedness and leverage ratios in response to the financial impact of COVID-19 on our\n22\nbusinesses resulted in S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings downgrading our debt ratings. As of September 28, 2024, Moody’s Ratings’ long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively; S&P Global Ratings’ long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and A-2 (Positive), respectively; and Fitch Ratings’ long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. Any future downgrades could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on acceptable terms.\nIn addition, increases in interest rates have increased our cost of borrowing and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets could impact our access to, or further increase the cost of, financing. Past disruptions in the U.S. and global credit and equity markets made it more difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. These conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments.\nElevated indebtedness or leverage ratios could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility.\nElevated indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our financial flexibility and our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and other uncontrollable events. Debt repayment obligations could also reduce funds available for investments, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends, and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Our leverage ratios increased as the result of COVID-19’s impact on financial performance, which caused certain of the credit ratings agencies to downgrade their assessment of our credit ratings. Downgrades to our credit ratings may negatively impact our cost of borrowings and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on acceptable terms.\nLabor disputes disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of our businesses.\nA significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses, including employees of our theme parks, and writers, directors, actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, some of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by works councils, trade unions or other employee associations. Further, some employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our licensed consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) are covered by labor agreements with their employers. From time to time, collective bargaining agreements and other labor agreements expire, requiring renegotiation of their terms. In general, labor disputes and work stoppages involving our employees; persons employed on our productions; athletes or others employed by, or otherwise connected with, sports leagues or organizers; or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our licensed consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt or lead to closure of certain operations and reduce our revenues and the profitability of our businesses. For example, in fiscal 2023, members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) commenced a work stoppage, which lasted for almost five months, and members of SAG-AFTRA, the union representing television and movie actors, also commenced a work stoppage, which lasted for almost four months. These work stoppages affected our productions and the pipeline for programming and theatrical releases, which resulted in reduced revenue for the impacted businesses. The new collective bargaining agreements with these and another entertainment guild and recently with certain labor unions at our domestic parks and resorts will increase our costs to create our content and to operate our domestic parks and resorts, respectively. In July 2024, members of SAG-AFTRA commenced a work stoppage against video game employers, which is ongoing. As a general matter, resolution of labor disputes and negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, including as a result of rate increases and other changes to employee benefits, has in the past increased our costs and may increase our costs in the future.\nThe seasonality of certain of our businesses and timing of certain of our product offerings could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations.\nEach of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations and variations in connection with the timing of our product offerings, including as follows:\n•\nRevenues at the Experiences segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities and seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in increased revenues during the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarters. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. Revenues at the Experiences segment also sometimes fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from special celebrations or events that increase demand in the applicable periods and decrease demand in prior or later periods as guests time their vacations to occur during such special celebrations or events. In addition, licensing revenues fluctuate with the timing and performance of our theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts.\n•\nRevenues from television networks and stations are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels, including related to certain sporting events. In general, domestic general entertainment linear networks advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months,\n23\nand sports advertising revenues are impacted by the timing of sports seasons and events, which varies throughout the year and/or take place periodically.\n•\nRevenues from content sales/licensing fluctuate due to the timing of content releases across various distribution markets. Release dates and methods are determined by a number of factors, including, among others, competition, and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n•\nDTC revenues fluctuate based on: changes in the number of subscribers, mix of subscribers to different offerings and subscriber fees; viewership levels; and the demand for sports and film and television content. Each of these is sensitive to the availability of content, which varies from time to time throughout the year based on, among other things, sports seasons, content production schedules and sports league work stoppages.\nAccordingly, negative impacts on our business occurring during a time of typical high seasonal demand such as our park closures due to hurricane damage during the summer travel season or other high seasons, could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year.\nOur operations are impacted by our ability to attract and retain employees and costs of employee wages and health, welfare and retirement benefits, including postretirement medical benefits for some employees and retirees, may reduce our profitability.\nWith approximately 233,000 employees, the success of our businesses is substantially affected by our ability to attract and retain a workforce with the necessary skills for our varied businesses, including executing successfully on succession planning for the talent at all levels necessary to advance the Company’s key objectives and strategies. Further, our profitability is substantially affected by labor costs, including wages and our health, welfare and retirement benefits, including the costs of medical benefits for current employees and the costs of postretirement medical benefits for some current employees and retirees. We may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic, regulatory, competitive and other factors. For example, labor costs in our parks and resorts have increased, and we expect will continue to increase, as a result of collective bargaining agreements and wage laws and regulations where we operate. Further, certain conditions in the healthcare industry, such as prolonged workforce shortages or rising prescription drug prices, may lead to an increase in the cost of medical insurance and expenses. In addition, for benefits provided to certain employees, changes in asset values, investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension and postretirement medical expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. These factors may also increase future funding requirements for these benefit plans. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in attracting and retaining the human resources necessary for the success of our businesses or in limiting cost increases from wages and other employee benefits, which could reduce the profitability of our businesses.\nWe face risks related to costs and expenses in connection with the acquisition of NBC Universal’s (NBCU) equity interest in Hulu and the TFCF acquisition.\nOn November 1, 2023, NBCU exercised its right to require the Company to purchase NBCU’s equity interest in Hulu under a put/call arrangement between the parties. The purchase price for NBCU’s equity interest in Hulu will be determined based on NBCU’s equity ownership percentage of the greater of Hulu’s equity fair value as of September 30, 2023 based on a contractual appraisal process, and a guaranteed floor value. Further, the Company will share with NBCU 50% of the Company’s tax benefit from the purchase of NBCU’s interest in Hulu, which payments are expected to be made primarily over a 15-year period. In May 2024, the Company and NBCU entered into a confidential arbitration to resolve a dispute regarding the contractual appraisal process, in which the parties seek declaratory relief, equitable relief and unspecified damages (see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). In addition, we may incur significant costs and expenses in connection with the TFCF acquisition, including costs for which we have established reserves or which may lead to reserves in the future. The cost to purchase NBCU’s equity interest in Hulu and related obligations to NBCU and any such other costs could negatively impact the Company’s cash position and result in the Company incurring additional indebtedness.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, CYBERSECURITY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nThe success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create.\nThe value to us of our IP is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. Where those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our IP may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. The terms of some copyrights for IP related to some of our products and services have expired, including the copyright term for the short film Steamboat Willie (1928) and early versions of characters depicted in this film, and other copyrights will expire in the future. For example, in the United States and countries that look to the United States copyright term when shorter than their own, the copyright term for early works and the specific early versions of characters depicted in those works expires at the end of the 95th calendar year after the date the copyright was originally\n24\nsecured in the United States. As copyrights expire, we expect that revenues generated from such IP will be negatively impacted to some extent.\nThe unauthorized use of our IP may increase the cost of protecting rights in our IP or reduce our revenues. The convergence of computing, communications and entertainment devices, increased broadband internet speed and penetration, increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and the enforcement of IP rights more challenging. The unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for IP rights holders. Further, the availability of certain AI tools has facilitated the creation of infringing works based on the unauthorized use of our IP. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry IP in one country can adversely affect the results of the Company’s operations worldwide, despite the Company’s efforts to protect its IP rights. Distribution innovations have increased opportunities to access content in unauthorized ways. Additionally, negative economic conditions coupled with a shift in government priorities could lead to less enforcement. These developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our IP against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content and other commercial misuses of our IP. The legal landscape for some new technologies, including some AI tools, remains uncertain, and development of the law in this area could impact our ability to protect against infringing uses.\nWith respect to IP developed by the Company and rights acquired by the Company from others, the Company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. In addition, the availability of copyright protection and other legal protections for IP generated by certain new technologies, such as generative AI, is uncertain. Successful challenges to our rights in IP typically result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from or utilize the IP that is the subject of challenged rights. From time to time, third parties allege that the Company is infringing certain third-party IP rights. Technological changes in industries in which the Company operates and extensive patent coverage in those areas increase the risk of such claims being brought and prevailing.\nCybersecurity and other data compromises and/or attempted compromises increase our costs, disrupt our services and business plans, lead to the disclosure of our confidential information, including unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and negatively impact our reputation.\nWe maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. We also use computer and cloud-based systems to deliver our products and services and operate our businesses. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access, modification, exfiltration, destruction or denial of access and our systems are subject to cyberattacks that from time to time result in disruptions in service. We also use many third-party systems and software, which are also subject to supply chain and other cyberattacks.\nWe have developed and maintain an information security program to assess, identify and manage cyber risks and the continued development and maintenance of this program is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change, including as a result of the proliferation of AI tools, and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. We face an increasingly challenging cybersecurity environment with expanding and evolving threats from a variety of potential bad actors. While we employ various tools in an effort to protect our data and systems, certain of our defenses remain subject to human error. Remote work by our employees and contractors and those of the third parties with whom we engage create additional risks. Despite our efforts, the risk of a potentially material incident as a result of unauthorized access, modification, exfiltration, destruction or denial of access with respect to data or systems and other cybersecurity attacks cannot be eliminated, and from time to time our systems have been compromised and may in the future be compromised. For example, as previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, in fiscal 2024 over a terabyte of data from one of the communications systems used by the Company was improperly exfiltrated and released. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in certain cases, which information and related systems have been compromised and are also subject to the risk of future material compromise.\nIf our information or cyber security systems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. We have experienced and may in the future experience cybersecurity attacks that result in the misappropriation of personal information of our customers and/or employees, which may result in reputational damage, loss of business and/or harm to employee morale. Related remediation of harm to our customers and employees or damages arising from litigation and/or fines or other actions we take with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of an incident create additional costs and/or impacts to our businesses. Insurance does not cover all potential losses or damages associated with such attacks or events. Our systems and users and those of third parties with whom we engage are continually attacked, sometimes successfully, and there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results.\n25\nRegulations applicable to our businesses impact the profitability of our businesses.\nEach of our businesses, including our broadcast networks and television stations, is subject to a variety of U.S. and international regulations, which impact the operations and profitability of our businesses. Some of these regulations include:\n•\nU.S. FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See Item 1 — Federal Communications Commission Regulation.\n•\nFederal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to child safety. See Item 1 — Privacy and Data Protection Regulation.\n•\nRegulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations, including regulation regarding the sourcing, importation and the sale of goods.\n•\nLand planning, use and development regulations applicable to our theme parks operations.\n•\nEnvironmental protection regulations.\n•\nU.S. and international anti-corruption laws, sanction programs, trade restrictions, anti-money laundering laws or currency controls.\n•\nRestrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions or film or television content requirements, investment obligations or quotas. See Item 1 — International Content Regulation.\n•\nDomestic and international labor laws, tax laws and antitrust laws.\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes in any of these current laws and regulations or regulator activities (or, if applicable, private litigation to enforce such laws and regulations) in any of these areas, or others, may require us to incur additional compliance costs, may restrict our ability to execute on our business strategies as planned or offer products and services in ways that are profitable, and create an increasingly unpredictable regulatory landscape. In addition, ongoing and future developments in international political, trade and security policy may lead to new regulations limiting international trade and investment and disrupting our operations outside the U.S., including our international theme parks and resorts operations in France, mainland China and Hong Kong. For example, in 2022 the U.S. and other countries implemented a series of sanctions against Russia in response to events in Russia and Ukraine; U.S. agencies have enhanced trade restrictions, including new prohibitions on the importation of goods from certain regions and other jurisdictions are considering similar measures; and U.S. state governments have become more active in passing legislation targeted at specific sectors and companies and applying existing laws in novel ways to new technologies, including streaming and online commerce. Further the legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies, such as AI, is uncertain and evolving and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies in one or more of our businesses.\nOur operations outside the U.S. are affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.\nOur operations outside the U.S. are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than, or in addition to, U.S. law. Laws in some international jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S. These differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights are sometimes different than would be expected under U.S. law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some international jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or U.S. anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR STOCK\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nThe price of our common stock has experienced substantial volatility and may continue to be volatile. Various factors have impacted, and may continue to impact, the price of our common stock, including, among others, changes in management; variations in our operating results; variations between our actual results and expectations of securities analysts; changes in our estimates, guidance or business plans; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; the activities, operating results or stock price of our competitors or other industry participants in the industries in which we operate; the announcement or completion of significant transactions by us or a competitor; events affecting the stock market generally; and the economic and political conditions in the U.S. and internationally, as well as other factors described in this Item 1A. Some of these factors may adversely impact the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, volatility in the price of our common stock may negatively impact one or more of our businesses, including by increasing stock awards for our employees who participate in our stock incentive programs or limiting our financing options for acquisitions and other business expansion.\n26\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe Company’s amended and restated bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its stockholders, which could increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit the ability of the Company’s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company’s directors, officers or other employees.\nThe Company’s amended and restated bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or stockholder of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation or remedy under, any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action or proceeding as to which the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, (v) or any action or proceeding asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company’s directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or the Company’s directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company’s amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in the Company’s amended and restated bylaws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder."

    "text": "Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have implemented processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats as part of our overall risk management program. Our cybersecurity program is informed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework as well as other globally recognized standards. We use a layered defense model, incorporating a wide range of technologies and practices in an effort to prevent, detect and mitigate threats. These measures include intrusion detection and prevention systems, multi-factor authentication, encryption and endpoint protection tools. We also implement threat detection and response solutions. To address emerging threats, we employ automated monitoring, vulnerability scans and patch management processes. Regular assessments, such as penetration tests, security audits and table-top exercises, are conducted to identify vulnerabilities and promote incident response and risk mitigation. We also provide privacy and information security trainings for our employees on a recurring basis. From time to time, we engage assessors, consultants and other third parties to assist with assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, including assisting us to conduct some of the foregoing assessments. Our cybersecurity risk management processes also are informed by intelligence received from recognized cybersecurity industry experts and other third-party sources, and as appropriate we engage outside counsel to advise on regulatory compliance and other cybersecurity risk management efforts.\nIn addition, we have processes designed to oversee and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers. Where appropriate based on the data and intellectual property to which these providers are reasonably expected to have access, we conduct security assessments and due diligence reviews of third-party systems for compliance with our security standards, and we include data protection language in our agreements with these third parties.\nFurther, as part of our cybersecurity risk management processes, we maintain an incident response plan (IRP) that establishes a set of procedures for reporting and handling cybersecurity events. The IRP delegates to an internal incident response team the initial assessment, investigation and remediation of the event and includes, among other procedures, guidelines for escalation to senior management and engagement with law enforcement. In certain instances, events are escalated to the Cybersecurity Incident Disclosure Subcommittee, which is a subcommittee of the Company’s Risk Management Committee (RMC) (discussed further below) and is responsible for, among other things, the accurate and timely disclosure of\n27\nmaterial cybersecurity incidents under the federal securities laws, including making the materiality determination and approving related securities disclosures.\nAs discussed in further detail in Item 1A – Risk Factors, the Company faces an increasingly challenging cybersecurity environment, and from time to time the persistent efforts of bad actors to gain unauthorized access to our and our service providers’ information systems and our confidential and proprietary information are successful. In fiscal 2024, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or provide assurances that we have not experienced undetected cybersecurity incidents or will not discover additional information about previously detected events.\nGovernance\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight responsibility for information technology risks, including cybersecurity and data security risks and mitigation strategies. The Audit Committee at least annually receives reports from the Senior Vice President, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) concerning the Company’s cybersecurity and data security risks, including ongoing efforts to prevent, detect, monitor, remediate and manage such cybersecurity threats, the threat environment, incident updates and emerging cybersecurity practices and technologies. The Chair of the Audit Committee reports on its discussion, including concerning cybersecurity matters, to the full Board. In addition, from time to time, senior management briefs the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee Chair and the Board on cybersecurity matters potentially of interest, including cybersecurity events, regulatory disclosures and regulatory trends.\nDay-to-day management of our information security strategy and operations is currently the responsibility of our CISO, who reports into our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to joining the Company, our CISO held senior leadership roles in various other organizations, including as CISO for a publicly traded, global retailer and as a consultant advising organizations on information security strategy, and as a Special Agent with the U.S. Secret Service focusing on electronic crimes. That experience is supplemented by the collective experience and expertise of our dedicated internal teams of cybersecurity personnel.\nIn addition, the Company’s RMC, a management level committee that includes, among others, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, oversees and supports the Company’s ongoing efforts to identify, assess and prioritize, manage and monitor the Company’s enterprise risks, including risks related to privacy and cybersecurity, and periodically reports certain discussions to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Audit Committee. The RMC’s Cybersecurity Incident Disclosure Subcommittee, whose members include the members of the RMC, the CISO and lead securities counsel, is tasked with assessing significant events for materiality, related timely and accurate disclosure under the securities laws and, as appropriate, escalating such events to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors."

    "text": "CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nOrganization of Information\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on the Company’s financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections:\n•\nConsolidated Results and Non-Segment Items\n•\nBusiness Segment Results\n•\nCorporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nDevelopments and Trends\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n•\nDTC Product Descriptions, Key Definitions and Supplemental Information\n•\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nIn Item 7, we discuss fiscal 2024 and 2023 results and comparisons of fiscal 2024 results to fiscal 2023 results. Discussions of fiscal 2022 results and comparisons of fiscal 2023 results to fiscal 2022 results can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in\nfor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMS\nRevenues for fiscal 2024 increased 3%, or $2.5 billion, to $91.4 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased $2.6 billion to income of $5.0 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year; and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations attributable to Disney increased to $2.72 compared to $1.29 in the prior year. The EPS increase was due to higher operating income at Entertainment.\nRevenues\nService revenues for fiscal 2024 increased 3%, or $2.3 billion, to $81.8 billion, due to higher subscription revenue, growth at our parks and experiences businesses, and, to a lesser extent, higher advertising revenue. These increases were partially offset\n32\nby lower theatrical distribution revenue, a decrease in TV/VOD distribution sales and lower affiliate revenue. Service revenues reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (Foreign Exchange Impact).\nCosts and expenses\nCost of services for fiscal 2024 decreased 1%, or $0.6 billion, to $52.5 billion, primarily due to lower non-sports programming and production costs, partially offset by higher sports programming and production costs and the impact of inflation and increased volumes at our parks and experiences businesses. Costs of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased 7%, or $0.4 billion, to $5.0 billion due to lower depreciation at our domestic parks and resorts and lower TFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization.\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges\n(1)\nIn the current year, goodwill impairments related to our general entertainment linear networks. In the prior year, goodwill impairments related to our general entertainment and international sports linear networks.\n(2)\nIn the current and prior years, content impairments related to strategic changes in our approach to content curation.\nOther Income (expense), net\nIn fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a gain of $\n169\nmillion on its investment in DraftKings, Inc. (DraftKings), which was sold in fiscal 2023.\nInterest Expense, net\nThe increase in interest expense was due to higher average rates, partially offset by lower average debt balances.\nThe increase in interest income, investment income and other was driven by a larger benefit from pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service cost, and investments gains in the current year compared to losses in the prior year, partially offset by the impact of lower cash and cash equivalent balances.\nEquity in the Income of Investees\nEquity in the income of investees decreased $207 million to $\n575\nmillion in the current year due to lower income from A+E.\n33\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nThe decrease in the effective income tax rate in the current year compared to the prior year was due to the recognition of a $418 million benefit in the current year related to prior years’ tax matters (Income Tax Reserve Adjustments) and a lower foreign effective tax rate. These decreases were partially offset by higher non-tax deductible impairments in the current year compared to the prior year. We recognized $2.9 billion of impairments in the current year and $0.7 billion of impairments in the prior year that are not tax deductible.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflected the comparison to the accretion of NBCU’s interest in Hulu and Major League Baseball’s interest in BAMTech LLC as well as lower results at our National Geographic business. These decreases were partially offset by improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. We had accreted to the redemption value for BAMTech LLC by November 2022 and to the guaranteed floor payment for Hulu by December 2023.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes, as applicable.\nCertain Items Impacting Results in the Year\nResults for fiscal 2024 were impacted by the following:\n•\nRestructuring and impairment charges of $3,595 million\n•\nTFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization of $1,677 million\n•\nOther expense of $65 million related to a legal ruling\n•\nIncome Tax Reserve Adjustments of $418 million\nResults for fiscal 2023 were impacted by the following:\n•\nRestructuring and impairment charges of $3,892 million\n•\nTFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization of $1,998 million\n•\nOther income, net of $96 million, primarily due to the DraftKings gain ($169 million), partially offset by a charge related to a legal ruling ($101 million)\n34\nA summary of the impact of these items on EPS is as follows:\n(1)\nTax benefit (expense) is determined using the tax rate applicable to the individual item.\n(2)\nEPS is net of noncontrolling interest, where applicable. Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.\n(3)\nIncludes amortization of intangibles related to TFCF equity investees.\n(4)\nRestructuring and impairment charges in the prior year include the impact of a content license agreement termination with A+E, which generated a gain at A+E. The Company’s 50% interest in this gain was $56 million (A+E gain) and is included in Restructuring and impairment charges in this table.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenue and segment operating income.\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\nEntertainment\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n•\nLinear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n•\nDirect-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n•\nContent Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n•\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n•\nSubscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n•\nProduction costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n•\nParticipations and residual expenses\n•\nFees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment’s businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing\n35\ncampaigns are generally recognized in the business of initial exploitation. Certain other costs, such as technology, shared services and certain labor related costs, are allocated based on metrics designed to correlate with consumption.\nSports\nThe Sports segment primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees, advertising, subscription fees, pay-per-view fees and sub-licensing of sports rights. Operating expenses consist primarily of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed sports rights and production costs related to live sports and other sports-related programming.\nExperiences\nThe Experiences segment primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant expenses include operating labor, infrastructure costs, costs of goods sold and distribution costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include technology support costs, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation. Other operating expenses include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings.\nEliminations\nThe following transactions are recognized in segment revenues and eliminated in total Company revenue:\n•\nFees paid by Hulu to ESPN and the Entertainment linear networks business for the right to air their networks on Hulu Live\n•\nFees paid by ABC Network and Disney+ to ESPN to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+, respectively\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS - 2024 vs. 2023\nThe following table presents revenues from our operating segments:\nThe following table presents income from our operating segments and other components of income from continuing operations before income taxes:\n(1)\nRestructuring and impairment charges in the prior year i\nnclude the A+E\ngain.\n36\nEntertainment\nRevenue and operating results for the Entertainment segment are as follows:\nRevenues\nThe increase in Entertainment revenues was due to subscription revenue growth, partially offset by decreases in theatrical distribution, affiliate and TV/VOD distribution revenues.\nOperating income\nThe increase in Entertainment operating income was due to improved results at Direct-to-Consumer and, to a lesser extent, Content Sales/Licensing and Other, partially offset by a decrease at Linear Networks.\nLinear Networks\nOperating results for Linear Networks are as follows:\nRevenues - Affiliate fees\nThe decrease in domestic affiliate revenue was due to a decline of 11% from fewer subscribers, including the impact of the non-renewal of carriage of certain networks by an affiliate, partially offset by an increase of 6% from higher effective rates.\nLower international affiliate revenue was attributable to decreases of 8% from fewer subscribers driven by channel closures, 3% from lower effective rates and 3% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\n37\nRevenues - Advertising\nThe decrease in domestic advertising revenue was due to a decrease of 14% from fewer impressions and 2% from lower rates. The decrease in impressions was due to lower average viewership. Lower rates were driven by a decrease in political advertising at the owned television stations.\nInternational advertising revenue decreased modestly compared to the prior year as decreases of 3% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact and 3% from fewer impressions were partially offset by an increase of 4% from higher rates.\nOperating Expenses\nThe decrease in domestic programming and production costs was due to a lower average cost mix of programming, including fewer hours of scripted programming, which reflected the impact of production delays as a result of guild strikes in the prior year.\nInternational programming and production costs were comparable to the prior year as the impact of channel closures and a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact were largely offset by inflation.\nThe decrease in other operating expenses was due to lower technology and distribution costs including the impact of international channel closures.\nEquity in the Income of Investees\nIncome from equity investees decreased $151 million, to $539 million from $690 million, due to lower income from A+E attributable to decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue.\nOperating Income from Linear Networks\nOperating income decreased 16%, to $3,452 million from $4,119 million due to decreases at our domestic and international businesses and lower income from equity investees.\nSupplemental revenue and operating income\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for Linear Networks:\n38\nDirect-to-Consumer\nOperating results for Direct-to-Consumer are as follows:\nRevenues - Subscription fees\nGrowth in subscription fees reflected increases of 10% attributable to higher effective rates due to increases in retail pricing and 6% from subscriber growth, partially offset by a decrease of 2% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\nRevenues - Advertising\nHigher advertising revenue reflected an increase of 26% from higher impressions, partially offset by a decrease of 12% from lower rates. The increase in impressions was due to Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar growth, in part reflecting the launches of the ad-supported Disney+ service domestically in December 2022 and internationally starting in November 2023 and airing more cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar. There were two significant International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments in the current year compared to one in the prior year.\nRevenues - Other\nThe increase in other revenue was due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\nKey Metrics\nIn addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics\n(1)\nto analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar and Hulu, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business:\nPaid subscribers at:\n39\nAverage Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber for the fiscal year ended:\n(1)\nSee discussion on page\n—DTC Product Descriptions, Key Definitions and Supplemental Information\n(2)\nTotal may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.\nDomestic Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $6.97 to $7.89 due to higher retail pricing, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to wholesale offerings.\nInternational Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $5.93 to $6.60 due to increases in retail pricing, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to ad-supported and promotional offerings and an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\nDisney+ Hotstar average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $0.66 to $0.96 due to higher retail pricing and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers in lower-priced markets.\nHulu SVOD Only average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $12.17 to $12.35 due to increases in retail pricing, partially offset by a lower mix of subscribers with premium add-ons and a higher mix of subscribers to multi-product and promotional offerings.\nHulu Live TV + SVOD average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $90.52 to $95.12 due to higher retail pricing, partially offset by lower advertising, a lower mix of subscribers with premium add-ons and a higher mix of subscribers to promotional offerings.\nOperating Expenses\nHigher programming and production costs at Hulu were due to an increase in subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live TV service primarily attributable to rate increases.\nThe decrease in programming and production costs at Disney+ and other was attributable to lower costs for non-sports content available on Disney+, partially offset by higher costs for cricket programming at Disney+ Hotstar. The increase in cricket programming costs reflected two significant ICC tournaments in the current year compared to one in the prior year.\nOther operating expenses decreased due to lower distribution costs.\nSelling, general, administrative and other\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increased $406 million, to $4,574 million from $4,168 million, primarily attributable to increases in marketing and labor costs.\nOperating Income (Loss) from Direct-to-Consumer\nOperating results from Direct-to-Consumer increased $2,639 million, to operating income of $143 million from an operating loss of $2,496 million due to improved results at Disney+.\n40\nContent Sales/Licensing and Other\nOperating results for Content Sales/Licensing and Other are as follows:\nRevenues - TV/VOD distribution\nThe decrease in TV/VOD distribution revenue was due to lower sales of episodic and, to a lesser extent, film content.\nRevenues - Theatrical distribution\nThe decrease in theatrical distribution revenue reflected fewer significant releases in the current year compared to the prior year. The current year included\nInside Out 2, Deadpool & Wolverine, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Alien: Romulus, Wish\nand\nThe Marvels.\nThe prior year included\nAvatar: The Way of Water, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, The Little Mermaid\n,\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\n,\nElemental\nand\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\nRevenues - Home entertainment distribution\nThe decrease in home entertainment distribution revenue was due to lower unit sales.\nRevenues - Other\nOther revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue at Lucasfilm’s special effects business due to higher rates and more projects.\nOperating expenses\nThe decrease in programming and production costs was due to lower production cost amortization attributable to the decreases in theatrical and TV/VOD distribution revenues, partially offset by higher film cost impairments.\nLower distribution costs and cost of goods sold were driven by decreases in theatrical, home entertainment and TV/VOD distribution costs, partially offset by an increase at Lucasfilm’s special effects business due to more projects.\nSelling, general, administrative and other\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $487 million, to $2,108 million from $2,595 million, driven by lower theatrical marketing costs reflecting fewer significant releases in the current year.\nOperating Income (Loss) from Content Sales/Licensing and Other\nOperating results from Content Sales/Licensing and Other increased $507 million, to income of $328 million from a loss of $179 million due to higher theatrical distribution results.\n41\nItems Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Entertainment\nThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to Entertainment that are excluded from segment operating income:\n(1)\nFiscal 2024 includes $1,287 million for goodwill impairments related to our general entertainment linear networks, $187 million for content impairments, a $158 million impairment of an equity investment and $38 million of severance. Fiscal 2023 includes $2,521 million for content impairments (net of the A+E gain), $425 million for a goodwill impairment related to our general entertainment linear networks, $248 million of severance, a $141 million impairment of an equity investment and $96 million of charges primarily related to exiting our businesses in Russia.\n(2)\nIn fiscal 2024, amortization of step-up on film and television costs was $271 million and amortization of intangible assets was $1,054 million. In fiscal 2023, amortization of step-up on film and television costs was $439 million and amortization of intangible assets was $1,151 million.\nSports\nOperating results for the Sports segment are as follows:\nRevenues - Affiliate fees\nThe decrease in domestic ESPN affiliate revenue was due to a decrease of 8% from fewer subscribers, partially offset by an increase of 7% from higher effective rates.\nInternational ESPN affiliate revenue was comparable to the prior year, as decreases from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact and fewer subscribers were largely offset by higher effective rates.\nLower Star India affiliate revenue was attributable to decreases of 7% from lower effective rates and 4% from fewer subscribers.\n42\nRevenues - Advertising\nThe increase in domestic ESPN advertising revenue was due to increases of 8% from higher rates and 3% from sponsorship revenue growth, partially offset by a decrease of 2% from lower average viewership.\nThe decrease in international ESPN advertising revenue was due to a decrease of 11% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact, partially offset by increases of 5% from higher rates and 2% from higher average viewership.\nHigher Star India advertising revenue was attributable to airing two significant ICC cricket tournaments in the current year compared to one in the prior year.\nRevenues - Subscription fees\nSubscription fees increased $133 million, to $1,650 million from $1,517 million, due to higher rates attributable to increases in retail pricing.\nRevenues - Other\nOther revenue increased $79 million, to $1,163 million from $1,084 million, due to higher fees received from the Entertainment segment to program sports and an increase in revenue from licensing the ESPN brand, partially offset by an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\nKey metrics\nIn addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics\n(1)\nto analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of ESPN+, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business:\nESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $5.49 to $6.14 due to increases in retail pricing and higher advertising revenue.\n(1)\nSee discussion on page\n—DTC Product Descriptions, Key Definitions and Supplemental Information\nOperating expenses\nProgramming and production costs at domestic ESPN increased in the current year compared to the prior year due to contractual rate increases and higher production costs.\n43\nThe increase in international ESPN programming and production costs was due to new soccer rights.\nHigher Star India programming and production costs were attributable to an increase in cricket programming costs due to airing two significant ICC tournaments in the current year compared to one in the prior year. This increase was partially offset by the comparison to costs for Board of Control for Cricket in India cricket programming in the prior year, which rights we did not renew for the current fiscal year.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $34 million, to $39 million from $73 million primarily due to technology assets that were fully depreciated in the prior year.\nOperating Income from Sports\nOperating income decreased $59 million, to $2,406 million from $2,465 million due to higher operating losses at Star India and, to a lesser extent, international ESPN, partially offset by an increase at domestic ESPN.\nSupplemental revenue and operating income\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income (loss) detail for the Sports segment:\nItems Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Sports\nThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to Sports that are excluded from segment operating income:\n(1)\nRepresents amortization of intangible assets.\n(2)\nFiscal 2023 includes $296 million for a goodwill impairment and $50 million for severance.\n44\nExperiences\nOperating results for the Experiences segment are as follows:\nRevenues - Theme park admissions\nThe increase in theme park admissions revenue was due to increases of 5% from higher average per capita ticket revenue and 2% from attendance growth.\nRevenues - Resorts and vacations\nGrowth in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily attributable to increases of 3% from higher average ticket prices for cruise line sailings, 1% from an increase in average daily hotel room rates and 1% from higher occupied hotel room nights, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from lower unit sales at Disney Vacation Club.\nRevenues - Parks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage\nParks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to increases of 2% from higher volumes and 2% from higher average guest spending.\nRevenues - Merchandise licensing and retail\nLower merchandise licensing and retail revenue was due to decreases of 1% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact and 1% from retail, partially offset by an increase of 1% from merchandise licensing. Lower retail revenue was due to a decrease in online sales. Growth in licensing revenue was due to higher royalties from merchandise sales, partially offset by lower minimum guarantee shortfall recognition.\nRevenues - Parks licensing and other\nThe increase in parks licensing and other revenue was attributable to higher sponsorship revenues, a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact and higher royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.\n45\nKey Metrics\nIn addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of our theme parks and resorts, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business\n:\n(1)\nPer capita guest spending growth rate and per room guest spending growth rate exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n(2)\nAttendance is used to analyze volume trends at our theme parks and is based on the number of unique daily entries, i.e. a person visiting multiple theme parks in a single day is counted only once. Our attendance count includes complimentary entries but excludes entries by children under the age of three.\n(3)\nPer capita guest spending is used to analyze guest spending trends and is defined as total revenue from ticket sales and sales of food, beverage and merchandise in our theme parks, divided by total theme park attendance.\n(4)\nOccupancy is used to analyze the usage of available capacity at hotels and is defined as the number of room nights occupied by guests as a percentage of available hotel room nights.\n(5)\nAvailable hotel room nights are defined as the total number of room nights that are available at our hotels and at DVC properties located at our theme parks and resorts that are not utilized by DVC members. Available hotel room nights include rooms temporarily taken out of service.\n(6)\nPer room guest spending is used to analyze guest spending at our hotels and is defined as total revenue from room rentals and sales of food, beverage and merchandise at our hotels, divided by total occupied hotel room nights. In the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, the Company revised its method of allocating revenue on the sales of Disneyland Paris vacation packages between hotel room revenue and admissions revenue. The new method resulted in a decrease in the percentage of revenue allocated to hotel rooms. If we had applied the new method in the first six months of the prior year, the impact would have been a decrease of approximatel\ny $30 million i\nn the prior year.\nOperating expenses\nThe increase in operating labor was primarily due to inflation and higher volumes. Higher infrastructure costs were primarily attributable to higher technology spending and an increase in operations support costs. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact, higher volumes and increased operations support costs.\nSelling, general, administrative and other\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increased $269 million from $3,675 million to $3,944 million, driven by inflation and increased marketing costs for new guest offerings, partially offset by the comparison to a loss in the prior year on the disposal of our ownership interest in Villages Nature.\n46\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $210 million from $2,789 million to $2,579 million, due to the comparison to depreciation in the prior year related to the closure of Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser.\nOperating Income from Experiences\nSegment operating income increased $318 million, from $8,954 million to $9,272 million primarily due to growth at international parks and experiences.\nSupplemental revenue and operating income\nThe following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Experiences segment:\nItems Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Experiences\nThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to Experiences that are excluded from segment operating income:\n(1)\nCharges for the current year were due to an impairment of assets at our retail business.\nCORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses are as follows:\nThe increase in corporate and unallocated shared expenses was primarily due to higher labor costs, increases in professional services and costs related to our proxy solicitation.\n47\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash is as follows:\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased 42% or $4.1 billion to $14.0 billion in the current year compared to $9.9 billion in the prior year. The increase was driven by lower film and television production spending and the timing of payments for sports rights. The increase also reflected collateral receipts related to our hedging program in the current year compared to collateral payments in the prior year, higher operating cash flows at Entertainment and the comparison to a payment in the prior year related to the termination of content licenses in fiscal 2022. The increase in operating cash flows at Entertainment was driven by lower cash disbursements due to a decrease in operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by higher cash tax payments in the current year compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2023 U.S. federal and California state tax payments were deferred and paid in fiscal 2024 pursuant to relief provided by the Internal Revenue Service and California State Board of Equalization as a result of 2023 winter storms in California. In addition, a portion of fiscal 2024 U.S. federal and Florida state taxes was paid in fiscal 2024 and the remainder has been deferred to fiscal 2025 pursuant to relief provided by the Internal Revenue Service and Florida Department of Revenue as a result of 2024 hurricanes in Florida.\nDepreciation expense is as follows:\nAmortization of intangible assets is as follows:\nProduced and licensed content costs\nThe Entertainment and Sports segments incur costs to produce and license film, episodic, sports and other content. Production costs include spend on content internally produced at our studios such as live-action and animated films, episodic series, specials, shorts and theatrical stage plays. Production costs also include original content commissioned from third-party studios. Programming costs include content rights licensed from third parties for use on the Company’s sports and general entertainment networks and DTC streaming services. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities.\n48\nThe Company’s production and programming activity for fiscal 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nThe Company currently expects its fiscal 2025 spend on produced and licensed content to be approximately $24 billion including sports rights but excluding Star India.  See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s contractual commitments to acquire sports and broadcast programming.\nCommitments and guarantees\nThe Company has various commitments and guarantees, such as long-term leases, purchase commitments and other executory contracts, that are disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. See Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these commitments.\nLegal and Tax Matters\nAs disclosed in Notes 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities, which consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity, for fiscal 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n49\nInvestments in Parks, Resorts and Other Property\nCapital expenditures at Entertainment primarily reflect investments in technology and in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.\nCapital expenditures at Experiences are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was due to higher spending on cruise ship fleet expansion, theme park and resort expansion and new attractions.\nCapital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. The decrease in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was due to lower spending on facilities.\nThe Company currently expects its fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to total approximately $8 billion compared to fiscal 2024 capital expenditures of $5 billion. The projected increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to higher spending at Experiences, attributable to continued investment in cruise ship fleet expansion and new guest offerings at our theme parks.\nOther Investing Activities\nCash used in other investing activities was $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024 reflecting an investment in Epic Games, Inc. Cash provided by other investing activities was $328 million for fiscal 2023 reflecting proceeds from the sale of investments.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities for fiscal 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n(1)\nActivities related to noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the current year were due to an $8.6  billion payment for Hulu’s redeemable noncontrolling interest and $0.5 billion of dividend payments to noncontrolling interest holders. Activities in the prior year were due to a $0.9 billion payment for BAMTech LLC’s redeemable noncontrolling interest and $0.5 billion of dividend payments to noncontrolling interest holders, partially offset by a $0.7 billion contribution from Hearst to acquire a 20% interest in our DTC sports business.\n(2)\nPrimarily consists of equity award activity.\nBorrowings activities and other\nDuring the year ended September 28, 2024, the Company’s borrowing activity was as follows:\n(1)\nBorrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net.\n(2)\nThe other activity is primarily due to the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and debt issuance fees.\n(3)\nSee Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding commitments to fund the Asia Theme Parks.\n(4)\nThe other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company’s borrowing activities in fiscal 2024 and information regarding the Company’s bank facilities. The Company may use cash balances, operating cash flows,\n50\ncommercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused $12.25 billion bank facilities and incremental term debt issuances to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2024. There were no dividends paid or share repurchases in fiscal 2023. The Company is targeting a total of $3 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2025.\nThe Company may be required to pay an incremental amount for Hulu depending on a final determination of Hulu’s fair value. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the transactions with noncontrolling interest holders.\nThe Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control. We believe that the Company’s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, contractual obligations, upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. In addition, the Company could undertake other measures to ensure sufficient liquidity, such as raising additional financing, reducing or not declaring future dividends; reducing or stopping share repurchases; reducing capital spending; reducing film and episodic content investments; or implementing further cost-saving initiatives.\nThe Company’s borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of September 28, 2024, Moody’s Ratings’ long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, S&P Global Ratings’ long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch Ratings’ long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On September 28, 2024, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.\nDEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS\nStar India Transaction\nThe Company and RIL plan to close a transaction on or about November 14, 2024, which will form a joint venture that combines our Star-branded and other general entertainment and sports television channels and Disney+ Hotstar service in India (Star India) and certain media and entertainment businesses of RIL (see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). The Company will have a 37% interest in the joint venture. The Company has consolidated, and will continue to consolidate, the income statement and cash flow activities of Star India through the closing date, at which time the Company will recognize on its balance sheet the 37% investment at fair value. In addition, the Company will begin recognizing its proportional share of the joint venture’s results in “Equity in the income of investees, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The equity earnings of the joint venture will not be reported in our segments’ operating results.\nTrends\nTo drive growth at our sports and entertainment businesses, we are, among other things, making strategic investments in our DTC offerings. Although there can be no assurances these investments will be successful, we expect that they will lead to growth in subscription fees and advertising revenues that will more than offset impacts on affiliate fees and advertising revenue from declines in linear network subscribers and the related decrease in average viewership, which we expect will continue.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProduced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs\nWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nProduction costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).\n51\nWith respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.\nWith respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.\nUltimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.\nProduction costs classified as individual are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title’s unamortized costs to the present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the extent the title’s unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.\nProduced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. The determination of projected usage requires judgment and is reviewed on a regular basis for changes. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Historical viewing patterns are the most significant input into determining the projected usage, and significant judgment is required in using historical viewing patterns to derive projected usage. If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.\nCost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\nThe amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on projections of revenues for each season relative to projections of total revenues over the contract period (estimated relative value). Projected revenues include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.\nPension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions\nThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We decreased our discount rate to\n5.06\n% at the end of fiscal 2024 from\n5.94\n% at the end of fiscal 2023 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2024 year-end measurement date. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2025 by approximately $0.2 billion and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 28, 2024 by approximately $2.4 billion. A one\n52\npercentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $0.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.25%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2025 annual expense by approximately $\n168\nmillion.\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments\nThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.\nGoodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, determining whether reporting units should be aggregated, the assignment of assets and liabilities including goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.\nIn fiscal 2024, we determined that our entertainment businesses, including DTC services, linear networks, and content sales/licensing, should be aggregated into a single reporting unit due to their interdependencies, including shared operating costs such as content, marketing, and technology, the similarity of products and services delivered, customers served and distribution channels used, and projected long term financial performance (e.g., operating margins).\nFor our annual impairment test, we bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.\nTo determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. Discount rates are determined based on the inherent risks of the underlying operations.\nSignificant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model used to determine fair value relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our businesses. Changes to these assumptions and shifts in market trends or macroeconomic events could impact test results in the future.\nAs discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, related to our entertainment linear networks reporting unit prior to aggregating all of our entertainment reporting units into a single reporting unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The carrying amount of the aggregated entertainment reporting unit goodwill after these impairments is approximately $51 billion.\nAfter the impairments, the fair value of the entertainment reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount by less than 10%. An approximate 40 basis point increase in the discount rate or an approximate 6% reduction in projected annual cash flows used to determine the fair value of the entertainment reporting unit would effectively eliminate the excess fair value over carrying amount.\nTo test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\n53\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded $1.5 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to the Star India Transaction in fiscal 2024 to reflect Star India at its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nThe Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded.\nThe Company tested its indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.7 billion and $2.3 billion in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fiscal 2024 charges related to impairments of retail assets, content assets, and equity investments. The fiscal 2023 charges primarily related to content impairments resulting from a strategic change in our approach to content curation. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. In times of economic turmoil our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nContingencies and Litigation\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on litigation exposure.\nIncome Tax\nAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to\n54\nsettle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.\nDTC PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS,  KEY DEFINITIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nProduct Offerings\nIn the U.S., Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu SVOD Only are each offered as a standalone service or as part of various multi-product offerings. Hulu Live TV + SVOD includes Disney+ and ESPN+. Disney+ is available in more than 150 countries and territories outside the U.S. and Canada. In India and certain other Southeast Asian countries, the service is branded Disney+ Hotstar. In certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a general entertainment SVOD service, which was available on a standalone basis or together with Disney+ (Combo+). At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering. Depending on the market, our services can be purchased on our websites or through third-party platforms/apps or are available via wholesale arrangements.\nPaid Subscribers\nPaid subscribers reflect subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Certain product offerings provide the option for an extra member to be added to an account (extra member add-on). These extra members are not counted as paid subscribers. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to multi-product offerings in the U.S. are counted as a paid subscriber for each of the Company's services included in the multi-product offering and subscribers to Hulu Live TV + SVOD are counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu Live TV + SVOD, Disney+ and ESPN+ services. In Latin America prior to July 2024, if a subscriber had either the standalone Disney+ or Star+ service or subscribed to Combo+, the subscriber was counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber. Subscribers include those who receive an entitlement to a service through wholesale arrangements, including those for which the service is available to each subscriber of an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC streaming services, we refer to them as paid subscriptions.\nInternational Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)\nInternational Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) includes the Disney+ service outside the U.S. and Canada.\nAverage Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber\nHulu and ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based on the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses), premium and feature add-on revenue and extra member add-on revenue but excludes Pay-Per-View revenue. Advertising revenue generated by content on one DTC streaming service that is accessed through another DTC streaming service by subscribers to both streaming services is allocated between both streaming services. The average revenue per paid subscriber is net of discounts on offerings that carry more than one service. Revenue is allocated to each service based on the relative retail or wholesale price of each service on a standalone basis. Hulu Live TV + SVOD revenue is allocated to the SVOD services based on the wholesale price of the Hulu SVOD Only, Disney+ and ESPN+ multi-product offering. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third-party platforms.\n55\nSupplemental information about paid subscribers\n(1)\n:\n(1)\nAt September 28, 2024, there were 19.7 million and 7.4 million subscribers to multi-product offerings with two and three of the Company’s services, respectively. At September 30, 2023, there were 20.3 million and 2.3 million subscribers to multi-product offerings with two and three of the Company’s services, respectively.\n(2)\nTotal may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.\n(3)\nDisney+ Hotstar is not included in any of the Company’s multi-product offerings.\n(4)\nThe services within the Combo+ multi-product offering were merged into a single Disney+ product offering in fiscal 2024. The Combo+ subscribers at September 30, 2023 were 10.8 million.\nSUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOn March 20, 2019, as part of the acquisition of TFCF, The Walt Disney Company (“TWDC”) became the ultimate parent of TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. (formerly known as The Walt Disney Company) (“Legacy Disney”). Legacy Disney and TWDC are collectively referred to as “Obligor Group”, and individually, as a “Guarantor”. Concurrent with the close of the TFCF acquisition, $16.8 billion of TFCF’s assumed public debt (which then constituted 96% of such debt) was exchanged for senior notes of TWDC (the “exchange notes”) issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019, between TWDC, Legacy Disney, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the “TWDC Indenture”) and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. On November 26, 2019, $14.0 billion of the outstanding exchange notes were exchanged for new senior notes of TWDC registered under the Securities Act, issued pursuant to the TWDC Indenture and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. In addition, contemporaneously with the closing of the March 20, 2019 exchange offer, TWDC entered into a guarantee of the registered debt securities issued by Legacy Disney under the Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 between Legacy Disney and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “2001 Trustee”) (as amended by the first supplemental indenture among Legacy Disney, as issuer, TWDC, as guarantor, and the 2001 Trustee, as trustee).\nOther subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either TWDC or Legacy Disney (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “non-Guarantors”). The par value and carrying value of total outstanding and guaranteed registered debt securities of the Obligor Group at September 28, 2024 was as follows:\nThe guarantees by TWDC and Legacy Disney are full and unconditional and cover all payment obligations arising under the guaranteed registered debt securities. The guarantees may be released and discharged upon (i) as a general matter, the indebtedness for borrowed money of the consolidated subsidiaries of TWDC in aggregate constituting no more than 10% of all consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money of TWDC and its subsidiaries (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) upon the sale, transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the equity interests or all or substantially all, or substantially as an entirety, the assets of Legacy Disney to a third party, and (iii) other customary events constituting a discharge of a guarantor’s obligations. In addition, in the case of Legacy Disney’s guarantee of registered debt securities issued by TWDC, Legacy Disney may be released and discharged from its guarantee at any time Legacy Disney is not a borrower, issuer or guarantor under certain material bank facilities or any debt securities.\nOperations are conducted almost entirely through the Company’s subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Obligor Group’s cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the public debt, are dependent upon the earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Obligor Group, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group.\n56\nSet forth below are summarized financial information for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between TWDC and Legacy Disney and (ii) equity in the earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-Guarantor. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP."

    "text": "The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.\nPolicies and Procedures\nIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.\nOur objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.\nOur objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in, or repatriate cash from, those countries.\nOur objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel, oil and gasoline.\nOur objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities. The amounts hedged using total return swap contracts are based on estimated liability balances.\nIt is the Company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.\nSee Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n57\nValue at Risk (VAR)\nThe Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. While various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation, the Company’s computations are based on a variance/co-variance technique, which assesses the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company’s debt,  interest rate and foreign exchange, and commodities derivatives, and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\nVAR on a combined basis decreased to $255 million at September 28, 2024 from $284 million at September 30, 2023 due to reduced interest rate volatility.\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\nThe VAR for Asia Theme Parks is immaterial as of September 28, 2024 and has been excluded from the above table."

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on our evaluation under the framework in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework,\nmanagement concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\n68\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Walt Disney Company\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging,\n69\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Assessment – Entertainment Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Services Reporting Units\nAs described in Notes 2, 4 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $73.3 billion as of September 28, 2024, of which a significant portion relates to the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units. Management performs the annual test of goodwill for impairment in the fiscal fourth quarter, and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Management bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. To determine the fair value of the Company’s reporting units, management generally uses a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates, and discount rates. Based on management’s projections, the carrying amounts of the entertainment linear networks reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and management recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $0.6 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the annual goodwill impairment assessment of the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates, and discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, for the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow models; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates, and discount rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, and terminal growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate assumptions.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nLos Angeles, California\nNovember 14, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1938.\n70\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in millions, except per share data)\n(1)\nTotal may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n71\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in millions)\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n72\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in millions, except share data)\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n73\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in millions)\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n74\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(in millions)\n(1)\nExcludes redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n75\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except where noted and per share amounts)\n1\nDescription of the Business and Segment Information\nThe Walt Disney Company, together with the subsidiaries through which businesses are conducted (the Company), is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in three segments: Entertainment, Sports and Experiences.\nThe terms “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which businesses are conducted.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\nEntertainment\nThe Entertainment segment generally encompasses the Company’s non-sports focused global film and television content production and distribution activities.\nThe lines of business within Entertainment along with their significant business activities include the following:\n•\nLinear Networks\n◦\nDomestic: ABC Television Network (ABC Network); Disney, Freeform, FX and National Geographic (owned\n73\n% by the Company) branded television channels; and eight owned ABC television stations\n◦\nInternational: Disney, FX, National Geographic (owned\n73\n% by the Company) and Star branded general entertainment television channels outside of the U.S.\n◦\nA\n50\n% equity investment in A+E Television Networks (A+E), which operates cable channels including A&E, HISTORY and Lifetime\n•\nDirect-to-Consumer\n◦\nDisney+: a global direct-to-consumer (DTC) service that primarily offers general entertainment and family programming\n◦\nDisney+ Hotstar: a DTC service primarily in India that offers general entertainment, family and sports programming.\n◦\nHulu: a U.S. DTC service that offers general entertainment and family programming and a digital over-the-top service that includes live linear streams of various cable and broadcast networks.

We do not present a measure of total assets for our reportable segments as this information is not used by management to allocate resources and capital.\nSegment operating results reflect earnings before corporate and unallocated shared expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, net other income, net interest expense, income taxes and noncontrolling interests. Segment operating income generally includes equity in the income of investees and excludes impairments of certain equity investments and acquisition accounting amortization of TFCF Corporation (TFCF) and Hulu assets (i.e. intangible assets and the fair value step-up for film and episodic costs) recognized in connection with the TFCF acquisition in fiscal 2019 (TFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization). Corporate and unallocated shared expenses principally consist of corporate functions, executive management and certain unallocated administrative support functions.\nSegment operating results include allocations of certain costs, including information technology, pension, legal and other shared services costs, which are allocated based on metrics designed to correlate with consumption.\nSegment revenues and segment operating income are as follows:\n(1)\nEquity in the income of investees is included in segment operating income as follows:\n(1)\nRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2023 include the impact of a content license agreement termination with A+E, which generated a gain at A+E. The Company’s\n50\n% interest of this gain was $\n56\nmillion (A+E gain).\n79\nA reconciliation of segment revenues to total revenues is as follows:\n(1)\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company early terminated certain license agreements with a customer for film and episodic content, which was delivered in previous years, in order for the Company to use the content primarily on our Entertainment Direct-to-Consumer services (Content License Early Termination). Because the content is functional IP, we had recognized substantially all of the consideration to be paid by the customer under the licenses as revenue in prior years when the content was delivered. Consequently, we have recorded the amounts to terminate the license agreements, net of remaining amounts of deferred revenue, as a reduction of revenue.\nA reconciliation of segment operating income to income from continuing operations before income taxes is as follows:\n(1)\nNet of the A+E Gain in fiscal 2023.\n(2)\n“Other income (expense), net” for fiscal 2024 and 2023 includes charges related to a legal ruling of $\n65\nmillion and $\n101\nmillion, respectively. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 include a gain of $\n169\nmillion and a loss of $\n663\nmillion, respectively, to adjust our investment in DraftKings, Inc. to fair value. The Company sold the DraftKings investment in fiscal 2023.\n(3)\nTFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization is as follows:\n80\nCapital expenditures, depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets are as follows:\nThe following table presents our revenues and segment operating income by geographical markets:\n81\nLong-lived assets\n(1)\nby geographical markets are as follows:\n(1)\nLong-lived assets are primarily parks, resorts and other property, produced and licensed content costs, right-of-use lease assets, equity method investments and benefit plans in a net asset position. The fiscal 2023 presentation has been adjusted to conform with the fiscal 2024 presentation.\n2\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The Walt Disney Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements.\nReporting Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were fifty-two week years.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2024 presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nRevenues and Costs from Services and Products\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\nSignificant service revenues include:\n•\nSubscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n•\nAffiliate fees\n•\nAdvertising revenues\n•\nAdmissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n•\nRevenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n•\nRoyalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games\n82\nSignificant operating costs related to the sale of services include:\n•\nProgramming and production costs\n•\nDistribution costs\n•\nOperating labor\n•\nFacilities and infrastructure costs\nSignificant tangible product revenues include:\n•\nThe sale of food, beverage and merchandise\n•\nThe sale of books, comic books and magazines\nSignificant operating costs related to the sale of tangible products include:\n•\nCosts of goods sold\n•\nOperating labor\n•\nDistribution costs\n•\nRetail occupancy costs\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenue recognition policies are as follows:\n•\nSubscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription.\n•\nAffiliate fees are recognized as the programming is provided based on contractually specified per subscriber rates and the actual number of the affiliate’s customers receiving the programming. For affiliate contracts with fixed license fees, the fees are recognized ratably over the contract term. If an affiliate contract includes a minimum guaranteed license fee, the guaranteed license fee is recognized ratably over the guaranteed period and any fees earned in excess of the guarantee are recognized as earned once the minimum guarantee has been exceeded. Affiliate agreements may also include a license to use the network programming for on demand viewing. As the fees charged under these contracts are generally based on a contractually specified per subscriber rate for the number of underlying subscribers of the affiliate, revenues are recognized as earned.\n•\nAdvertising sales are recognized as revenue, net of agency commissions, when commercials are aired. For contracts that contain a guaranteed number of impressions, revenues are recognized based on impressions delivered. When the guaranteed number of impressions is not met (“ratings shortfall”), revenues are not recognized for the ratings shortfall until the additional impressions are delivered.\n•\nTheme park admissions are recognized when the tickets are used. Sales of annual passes are recognized ratably over the period for which the pass is available for use.\n•\nResorts and vacations sales are recognized as revenue as the services are provided to the guest. Sales of vacation club properties are recognized as revenue upon the later of when title transfers to the customer or when construction activity is deemed complete.\n•\nMerchandise, food and beverage sales are recognized at the time of sale. Sales from our branded internet shopping sites and to wholesalers are recognized upon delivery. We estimate returns and customer incentives based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of consumer demand for our products.\n•\nMerchandise licensing fees are recognized as revenue as earned based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the licensee’s underlying product sales. For licenses with minimum guaranteed license fees, the excess of the minimum guaranteed amount over actual royalties earned (“shortfall”) is recognized straight-line over the remaining license period once an expected shortfall is probable.\n•\nTV/VOD distribution fixed license fees are recognized as revenue when the content is available for use by the licensee. License fees based on the underlying sales of the licensee are recognized as revenue based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the licensee sales.\nFor TV/VOD licenses that include multiple titles with a fixed license fee across all titles, each title is considered a separate performance obligation. The fixed license fee is allocated to each title at contract inception and the allocated license fee is recognized as revenue when the title is available for use by the licensee.\nWhen the license contains a minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles, the license fees earned by titles in excess of their allocated amount are deferred until the minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles is exceeded. Once the minimum guaranteed license fee is exceeded, revenue is recognized as earned based on the licensee’s underlying sales.\nTV/VOD distribution contracts may limit the licensee’s use of a title to certain defined periods of time during the contract term. In these instances, each period of availability is generally considered a separate performance obligation. For these contracts, the fixed license fee is allocated to each period of availability at contract inception based on\n83\nrelative standalone selling price using management’s best estimate. Revenue is recognized at the start of each availability period when the content is made available for use by the licensee.\nWhen the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, revenues are recognized when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension.\n•\nTheatrical distribution licensing fees are recognized as revenue based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the distributor’s underlying sales from exhibition of the film.\n•\nHome entertainment sales in electronic formats are recognized as revenue when the content is available for use by the consumer. Royalties from the licensing of physical home entertainment distribution rights are recognized as revenue as earned based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the licensee’s underlying product sales. Sales in physical formats through distributors are recognized as revenue on the later of the delivery date or the date that the product can be sold by retailers. We reduce home entertainment physical distribution revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and sales incentives based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of consumer demand for our products.\n•\nTaxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue.\n•\nShipping and handling fees collected from customers are recorded as revenue and the related shipping expenses are recorded in cost of products upon delivery of the product to the consumer.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of current and non-current accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n6.1\nbillion, $\n6.4\nbillion and $\n7.2\nbillion, respectively. The decrease in advertising expense for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was due to a decrease in theatrical marketing costs. The decrease in advertising expense for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was due to lower spend for our DTC streaming services.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to the total of the amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nInvestments\nInvestments in equity securities with a readily determinable fair value, not accounted for under the equity method, are recorded at that value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. For equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, the investment is recorded at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus adjustments related to observable transactions for the same or similar securities, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.\nFor equity method investments, the Company regularly reviews its investments to determine whether there is a decline in fair value below book value. If there is a decline that is other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to fair value.\nTranslation Policy\nGenerally, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our international film and episodic content distribution and licensing businesses and the branded international channels and DTC streaming services. Generally, the local currency is the functional currency for the Asia Theme Parks, Disneyland Paris, international sports channels and international locations of The Disney Store.\n84\nFor U.S. dollar functional currency locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for non-monetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income.\nFor local currency functional locations, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI).\nInventories\nInventory primarily includes vacation timeshare units, merchandise, food, materials and supplies. Carrying amounts of vacation ownership units are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Carrying amounts of merchandise, food, materials and supplies inventories are generally determined on a moving average cost basis and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nFilm and Television Content Costs\nThe Company classifies its capitalized produced and acquired/licensed content costs as long-term assets (“Produced and licensed content costs” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and classifies advances for live programming rights made prior to the live event as short-term assets (“Content advances” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet). For produced content, we capitalize all direct costs incurred in the physical production of a film, as well as allocations of production overhead and capitalized interest. For licensed and acquired content, we capitalize the license fee or acquisition cost, respectively. For purposes of amortization and impairment, the capitalized content costs are classified based on their predominant monetization strategy as follows:\n•\nIndividual - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are directly attributable to the specific film or television title (e.g. theatrical revenues or sales to third-party television programmers)\n•\nGroup - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g. subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network)\nThe determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content. Imputed title by title license fees that may be necessary for other purposes are established as required for those purposes.\nWe generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC streaming services or Linear Networks as group assets. We generally classify content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees as individual assets. The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title’s monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g. content that was initially intended for license to a third party is instead used on an owned DTC service). When there is a significant change in monetization strategy, the title’s capitalized content costs are tested for impairment.\nProduction costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues). For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films. For episodic series that are classified as individual, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. Participations and residuals are expensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.\nProduction costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.\nLicensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our Linear Networks, domestic ESPN television network, International Sports Channels or DTC streaming services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.\n85\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over\n20\nyears from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, except it excludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in “Cost of services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title’s unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the extent the title’s unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\nContent Production Incentives\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as “Produced and licensed content costs” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as “Costs of services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset’s amortization period.\nInternal-Use Software Costs\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $\n1.3\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to\n5\nyears.\nParks, Resorts and Other Property\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost.\nDepreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether a contract is a lease at contract inception or for a modified contract at the modification date. At inception or modification, the Company calculates the present value of operating lease payments using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease, which is determined by estimating what it would cost the Company to borrow a collateralized amount equal to the total lease payments over the lease term based on the contractual terms of the lease and the location of the leased asset. Our leases may require us to make fixed rental payments, variable lease payments based on usage or sales and fixed non-lease costs relating to the leased asset. Variable lease payments are generally not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Fixed non-lease costs, for example common-area maintenance costs, are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components.\n86\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.\nGoodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment (see Note 18).\nThe impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model relate to projections of future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. Discount rates for each reporting unit are determined based on the inherent risks of each reporting unit’s underlying operations. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ.\nTo test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our trademarks and FCC licenses, which are our most significant indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of\n5\nto\n40\nyears. The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company expects its aggregate annual amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for fiscal 2025 through 2029 to be as follows:\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future\n87\ncash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.\nThe Company recorded non-cash impairment charges in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 that are further described in Note 18.\nFinancial Risk Management Contracts\nIn the normal course of business, the Company employs a variety of financial instruments (derivatives) including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.\nThe Company formally documents all relationships between hedges and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company primarily enters into\ntwo\ntypes of derivatives: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure. Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment. Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g. forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g. floating-rate debt).\nThe Company designates and assigns the derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities. When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged impact earnings or are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated derivatives.\nThe Company’s hedge positions are measured at fair value on the balance sheet. Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged. The Company accrues the differential for interest rate swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates change as adjustments to interest expense over the lives of the swaps. Gains and losses on the termination of effective swap agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.\nThe Company enters into derivatives that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivatives are intended to offset certain economic exposures of the Company and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions (see Notes 8 and 17).\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded with respect to temporary differences in the accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount that, in management’s judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nA tax position must meet a minimum probability threshold before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nHulu LLC\nThe Company has a\n67\n% ownership interest in Hulu. In November 2023, NBC Universal (NBCU) exercised its right to require the Company to purchase their\n33\n% interest in Hulu at a redemption value based on NBCU’s equity ownership percentage of the greater of Hulu’s equity fair value or a guaranteed floor value of $\n27.5\nbillion. In connection with the redemption, the Company will pay NBCU\n50\n% of the future tax benefits from the amortization of the purchase of NBCU’s interest in Hulu as the Company’s cash tax benefits are realized, generally over a\n15\n-year period. In December 2023, the Company paid NBCU $\n8.6\nbillion, which reflected the guaranteed floor value less NBCU’s unpaid capital call contributions. If Hulu’s equity fair value is determined pursuant to a contractual appraisal process to be higher than the guaranteed floor value, the Company is required to pay NBCU its share of the difference between the equity fair value and the guaranteed floor value.\n88\nIn May 2024, the Company and NBCU entered into a confidential arbitration to resolve a dispute regarding the contractual appraisal process, in which the parties seek declaratory relief, equitable relief and unspecified damages. The Company expects a decision in that arbitration in fiscal 2025. The outcome of the arbitration is uncertain, and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the arbitration on the appraisal process, and thus any impact on the determination of Hulu’s equity fair value and any additional amount we may be required to pay to acquire NBCU’s interest in Hulu.\nAs part of the arbitration the Company disputes the validity of aspects of NBCU’s appraisal and the corresponding process. Consequently, completion of the appraisal process, including the manner of determining any such additional amount payable by the Company, awaits the resolution of the confidential arbitration.\nDuring the initial phase of the appraisal process, the Company’s appraiser arrived at a valuation that falls below the guaranteed floor value, while NBCU’s appraiser arrived at a valuation substantially in excess of the guaranteed floor value. Once the arbitration is completed, determination of the final equity fair value will take into account the valuation of a third appraiser pursuant to the appraisal process as resolved by the arbitration. If the third appraiser’s equity fair value determination were equal to or below the guaranteed floor value, the Company would not be required to pay NBCU any additional amount. Conversely, if NBCU’s appraiser’s valuation were deemed to be valid and the third appraiser’s equity fair value determination were consistent with the NBCU’s appraiser’s valuation, the Company would be required to pay NBCU an additional amount of approximately $\n5\nbillion as its share of the difference between the equity fair value and the guaranteed floor value. If the third appraiser’s equity fair value determination were between the valuations of the Company’s and NBCU’s appraisers, the incremental amount would likewise be between\nzero\nand approximately $\n5\nbillion.\nAny incremental amount determined to be payable to NBCU to acquire NBCU’s interest in Hulu would be recorded as “Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests” and thus reduce “Net income attributable to Disney” in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period recorded.\nBAMTech LLC\nIn November 2022, the Company purchased MLB’s\n15\n% redeemable noncontrolling interest in BAMTech LLC, which holds the Company’s domestic DTC sports business, for $\n900\nmillion (MLB buy-out). MLB’s interest was recorded in the Company’s financial statements at $\n828\nmillion prior to the MLB buy-out. The $\n72\nmillion difference was recorded as an increase in “Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the fiscal year ended 2023, Hearst Corporation (Hearst) contributed $\n710\nmillion to the domestic DTC sports business, in part to fund its\n20\n% share of the MLB buy-out and in part to fund its share of the domestic DTC sports business’s operating cash requirements, which had been funded by the Company through intercompany loans.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Disney by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year, which is calculated using the treasury-stock method for equity-based awards (Awards). Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods for which they have an anti-dilutive effect. Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period are anti-dilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.\nA reconciliation of the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding and the number of Awards excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, as they were anti-dilutive, are as follows:\n89\n3\nRevenues\nThe following table presents our revenues by segment and major source:\n90\nThe following table presents our revenues by segment and primary geographical markets:\nRevenues recognized in the current and prior year from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous reporting periods primarily relate to revenues earned on TV/VOD licenses for titles made available to the licensee in previous reporting periods. For fiscal 2024,\n$\n1.0\nbillion\nwas recognized related to performance obligations satisfied prior to September 30, 2023. For fiscal 2023, $\n0.9\nbillion was recognized related to performance obligations satisfied prior to October 1, 2022. For fiscal 2022, $\n1.1\nbillion was recognized related to performance obligations satisfied prior to October 2, 2021.\nAs of September 28, 2024, revenue for unsatisfied performance obligations expected to be recognized in the future is\n$\n16\nbillion\n, primarily for IP or advertising time to be made available in the future under existing agreements with merchandise and co-branding licensees and sponsors, television station affiliates, DTC wholesalers, sports sublicensees and advertisers. Of this amount, we expect to recognize approximately\n$\n7\nbillion\nin fiscal 2025,\n$\n4\nbillion\nin fiscal 2026,\n$\n2\nbillion\nin fiscal 2027 and\n$\n3\nbillion\nthereafter. These amounts include only fixed consideration or minimum guarantees and do not include amounts related to (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less (such as most advertising contracts) or (ii) licenses of IP that are solely based on the sales of the licensee.\nWhen the timing of the Company’s revenue recognition is different from the timing of customer payments, the Company recognizes either a contract asset (customer payment is subsequent to revenue recognition and subject to the Company satisfying additional performance obligations) or deferred revenue (customer payment precedes the Company satisfying the performance obligations). Consideration due under contracts with payment in arrears is recognized as accounts receivable. Deferred revenues are recognized as (or when) the Company performs under the contract. The Company’s contract assets and activity for the current and prior-year periods were not material.\nAccounts receivable and deferred revenues from contracts with customers are as follows:\n91\nFor fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $\n5.2\nbillion, $\n5.1\nbillion and $\n3.6\nbillion, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balance at September 30, 2023, October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. Amounts deferred generally relate to theme park admissions and vacation packages, DTC subscriptions and advances related to merchandise and TV/VOD licenses.\nThe Company has accounts receivable with original maturities greater than one year related to the sale of vacation club properties and film and television program rights (TV/VOD licensing). These receivables are discounted to present value at contract inception and the related revenues are recognized at the discounted amount. The balance of vacation club receivables recorded in other non-current assets was $\n0.7\nbillion at both September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The balance of TV/VOD licensing receivables recorded in other non-current assets was $\n0.3\nbillion at September 28, 2024 and $\n0.6\nbillion at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses for vacation club and TV/VOD licensing receivables and related activity for fiscal 2024 and 2023 were not material.\n4.\nDispositions\nThe Company and RIL plan to close the Star India Transaction on or about November 14, 2024, which will form a joint venture that includes Star India and certain media and entertainment businesses controlled by RIL, primarily in India. RIL has an effective\n56\n% controlling interest in the joint venture with\n37\n% held by the Company, and\n7\n% by Bodhi Tree Systems, a third party investment company.\nStar India’s assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2024, and we recorded $\n1.5\nbillion of non-cash impairment charges in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in fiscal 2024 to reflect Star India at its fair value less costs to sell. The measurement of these impairment charges included non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses of approximately $\n0.8\nbillion. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we anticipate we will recognize a non-cash tax charge of approximately $\n0.3\nbillion in connection with the close of the transaction.\nAssets and liabilities of Star India are classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2024 as follows:\n(1)\nTotal current assets and non-current assets held for sale are included in “Other current assets” and “Other assets,” respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total current liabilities and non-current liabilities held for sale are included in “Deferred revenue and other” and “Other long-term liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets and liabilities are subject to change through closing.\n92\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:\n(1)\nCurrent year reflects impairments related to entertainment linear networks and Star India (see Note 18). Prior year reflects impairments at entertainment and international sports linear networks (see Note 18).\n5\nInvestments\nInvestments consist of the following:\nInvestments, Equity Basis\nThe Company’s significant equity investments include A+E (\n50\n% ownership), Tata Play Limited (\n30\n% ownership) and CTV Specialty Television, Inc. (\n30\n% ownership). As of September 28, 2024, the book value of the Company’s equity method investments exceeded our share of the book value of the investees’ underlying net assets by approximately $\n0.5\nbillion, which represents amortizable intangible assets and goodwill arising from acquisitions.\nInvestments, Other\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had securities without a readily determinable fair value of $\n1.7\nbillion and $\n0.2\nbillion, respectively, the most significant of which at September 28, 2024 is an\n8\n% interest in Epic Games, Inc. valued at $\n1.5\nbillion.\nGains, losses and impairments on securities are generally recorded in “Interest expense, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Income; these amounts were not material for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. See Note 1 for realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n6\nInternational Theme Parks\nThe Company has a\n48\n% ownership interest in the operations of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and a\n43\n% ownership interest in the operations of Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks), which are both VIEs consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. See Note 2 for the Company’s policy on consolidating VIEs. In addition, the Company has\n100\n% ownership of Disneyland Paris. The Asia Theme Parks together with Disneyland Paris are collectively referred to as the International Theme Parks.\n93\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amounts of the Asia Theme Parks’ assets and liabilities included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet:\nThe following table summarizes the International Theme Parks’ revenues and costs and expenses included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2024:\nAsia Theme Parks’ royalty and management fees of $\n310\nmillion for fiscal 2024 are eliminated in consolidation, but are considered in calculating earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nInternational Theme Parks’ cash flows included in the Company’s fiscal 2024 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows were $\n1.7\nbillion provided by operating activities, $\n0.9\nbillion used in investing activities and $\n0.1\nbillion used in financing activities.\nHong Kong Disneyland Resort\nThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the Company have a\n52\n% and a\n48\n% equity interest in Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, respectively.\nThe Company and HKSAR have provided loans to Hong Kong Disneyland Resort with outstanding balances of $\n101\nmillion and $\n68\nmillion, respectively. The interest rate on both loans is three month HIBOR plus\n2\n%, and the scheduled maturity date is September 2025. The Company’s loan is eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company has provided Hong Kong Disneyland Resort with a revolving credit facility of HK $\n2.7\nbillion ($\n347\nmillion), which bears interest at a rate of three month HIBOR plus\n1.25\n% and matures in December 2028. The line of credit does not have a balance outstanding.\nHong Kong Disneyland Resort is undergoing a multi-year expansion estimated to cost HK $\n10.9\nbillion ($\n1.4\nbillion). The Company and HKSAR have agreed to fund the expansion on an equal basis through equity contributions, which totaled $\n18\nmillion and $\n57\nmillion in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. To date, the Company and HKSAR have funded a total of $\n791\nmillion.\nHKSAR has the right to receive additional shares over time to the extent Hong Kong Disneyland Resort exceeds certain return on asset performance targets. The amount of additional shares HKSAR can receive is capped on an annual basis and could decrease the Company’s equity interest by up to\n6\npercentage points over a period no shorter than\n10\nyears.\nShanghai Disney Resort\nShanghai Shendi (Group) Co., Ltd (Shendi) and the Company have\n57\n% and\n43\n% equity interests in Shanghai Disney Resort, respectively. A management company, in which the Company has a\n70\n% interest and Shendi a\n30\n% interest, operates Shanghai Disney Resort.\nThe Company has provided Shanghai Disney Resort with loans totaling $\n961\nmillion bearing interest at\n8\n% and are scheduled to mature in 2036 with earlier payments required based on available cash flows. In addition, early repayment is permitted. The loan is eliminated in consolidation.

The line of credit does not have a balance outstanding.\n7\nProduced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs and Advances\nTotal capitalized produced and licensed content by predominant monetization strategy is as follows:\nAmortization of produced and licensed content is as follows:\n(1)\nPrimarily included in “Costs of services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Fiscal 2024 amounts exclude impairment charges of $\n187\nmillion for produced content and fiscal 2023 amounts exclude impairment charges of $\n2.0\nbillion for produced content and $\n257\nmillion for licensed programming rights recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 18).\n95\nTotal expected amortization by fiscal year of completed (released and not released) produced, licensed and acquired film and television library content on the balance sheet as of September 28, 2024 is as follows:\nApproximately $\n2.2\nbillion of accrued participations and residual liabilities will be paid in fiscal 2025.\nAt September 28, 2024, acquired film and television library content has remaining unamortized costs of $\n3.5\nbillion, which are generally being amortized straight-line over a weighted-average remaining period of approximately\n14\nyears.\nContent Production Incentives\nProgramming and production costs were reduced by $\n0.6\nbillion for fiscal 2024 related to the amortization of production tax incentives. We have production tax credit receivables of $\n1.7\nbillion as of September 28, 2024, which, based on the expected timing of collection, are reflected in “Receivables, net” or “Other Assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n96\n8\nBorrowings\nThe Company’s borrowings, including the impact of interest rate and cross-currency swaps, are summarized as follows:\n(1)\nThe stated interest rate represents the weighted-average coupon rate for each category of borrowings. For floating-rate borrowings, interest rates are the rates in effect at September 28, 2024; these rates are not necessarily an indication of future interest rates.\n(2)\nAmounts represent notional values of interest rate and cross-currency swaps outstanding as of September 28, 2024.\n(3)\nThe effective interest rate includes the impact of existing and terminated interest rate and cross-currency swaps, purchase accounting adjustments and debt issuance premiums, discounts and costs.\n(4)\nIncludes net debt issuance discounts, costs and purchase accounting adjustments totaling a net premium of $\n1.6\nbillion and $\n1.8\nbillion at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n(5)\nIncludes market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges, which reduces borrowings by $\n0.9\nbillion and $\n1.8\nbillion at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nBank Facilities and Commercial Paper\nAt September 28, 2024, the Company’s bank facilities, which are with a syndicate of lenders and support our commercial paper borrowings, were as follows:\nThese facilities allow for borrowings at rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), and at other variable rates for non-U.S. dollar denominated borrowings plus a fixed spread that varies with the Company’s debt ratings assigned by Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings ranging from 0.655% to 1.225%.\nThe bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On September 28, 2024, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The bank facilities specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default. The Company also has the ability to issue up to $\n500\nmillion of letters of credit under the facility expiring in March 2027, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of September 28, 2024, the Company has $\n1.6\nbillion of outstanding letters of credit, of which none were issued under this facility.\n97\nCommercial paper activity is as follows:\n(1)\nBorrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net.\nU.S. Dollar Denominated Notes\nAt September 28, 2024, the Company had $\n40.5\nbillion of fixed rate U.S. dollar denominated notes with maturities ranging from\n1\nto\n72\nyears and stated interest rates that range from\n1.75\n% to\n8.50\n%.\nForeign Currency Denominated Debt\nAt September 28, 2024, the Company had fixed rate senior notes of Canadian $\n1.3\nbillion ($\n0.9\nbillion), which had a stated interest rate of\n2.76\n% and was paid in October 2024, and Canadian $\n1.3\nbillion ($\n1.0\nbillion), which had a stated interest rate of\n3.06\n% and matures in March 2027. The Company has entered into pay-floating interest rate and cross-currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings to a variable-rate U.S. dollar denominated borrowings indexed to SOFR.\nCruise Ship Credit Facilities\nAt September 28, 2024, the Company had two credit facilities to finance, at its option, a significant portion of the contract price of two new cruise ships. With the delivery of the\nDisney Treasure\n, which occurred in October 2024, the Company borrowed $\n1.1\nbillion under one credit facility with a fixed interest rate of\n3.80\n% in November 2024 that will be payable semi-annually over\n12\nyears. The remaining credit facility for $\n1.1\nbillion may be utilized to finance a significant portion of the contract price of the\nDisney Destiny\n, which is currently scheduled to be delivered in fiscal 2026. If utilized, the loan will have a fixed interest rate of\n3.74\n% and will be payable semi-annually over\n12\nyears. Early repayment of both facilities is permitted subject to cancellation fees.\nAsia Theme Parks Borrowings\nHKSAR provided Hong Kong Disneyland Resort with loans totaling HK $\n0.5\nbillion ($\n68\nmillion). The interest rate is three month HIBOR plus\n2\n% and the maturity date is September 2025.\nShendi has provided Shanghai Disney Resort with loans totaling\n8.6\nbillion yuan (approximately $\n1.2\nbillion) bearing interest at\n8\n% and is scheduled to mature in 2036 with earlier payments required based on available cash flows. In addition, early repayment is permitted. Shendi has also provided Shanghai Disney Resort with a\n2.6\nbillion yuan (approximately $\n0.4\nbillion) line of credit bearing interest at\n8\n%. As of September 28, 2024, the line of credit does not have a balance outstanding.\n98\nMaturities\nThe following table provides total borrowings, excluding market value adjustments and debt issuance premiums, discounts and costs, by scheduled maturity date as of September 28, 2024. The table also provides the estimated interest payments on these borrowings as of September 28, 2024 although actual future payments will differ for floating-rate borrowings:\nInterest\nThe Company capitalizes interest on assets constructed for its parks and resorts and on certain film and television productions. In fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, total interest capitalized was $\n386\nmillion, $\n365\nmillion and $\n261\nmillion, respectively.\nInterest expense (net of amounts capitalized), interest and investment income, and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs (other than service costs) (see Note 10) are reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Income and consist of the following:\n9\nIncome Taxes\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes by Domestic and Foreign Subsidiaries\n99\nProvision for Income Taxes: Current and Deferred\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n(1)\nFurther details on our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are as follows:\n(a)\nApproximately $\n2.2\nbillion of these credits do not expire. Approximately $\n1.1\nbillion expire between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2034, primarily consisting of U.S. foreign tax credits\n.\n(2)\nAmounts are, in part, due to the tax status of these entities and if the tax status of certain legal entities changes, a significant portion of this balance may reverse.\n100\nThe following table details the change in valuation allowance for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in billions):\nReconciliation of the effective income tax rate for continuing operations to the federal rate\n(1)\nFiscal 2023 includes an adjustment related to certain deferred state taxes\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the related accrual for interest and penalties, is as follows:\nBalances at September 28, 2024, September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 include $\n1.4\nbillion, $\n1.8\nbillion and $\n1.9\nbillion, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate. These amounts are net of the offsetting benefits from other tax jurisdictions.\nAt September 28, 2024, September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $\n0.9\nbillion, $\n1.0\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion, respectively. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded additional interest and penalties of $\n157\nmillion, $\n210\nmillion and $\n157\nmillion, respectively, and recorded reductions in accrued interest and penalties of $\n151\nmillion, $\n241\nmillion and $\n119\nmillion, respectively. The Company’s policy is to report interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company is generally no longer subject to U.S. federal examination for years prior to 2018. The Company is no longer subject to examination in any of its major state or foreign tax jurisdictions for years prior to 2008.\nIn the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could change due to the resolution of open tax matters, which would reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by $\n0.9\nbillion.\nOther\nIn fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized income tax expense of $\n55\nmillion and $\n93\nmillion, respectively, for the shortfall between equity-based compensation deductions and amounts recorded based on the grant date fair value. In fiscal\n101\n2022, the Company recognized income tax benefits of $\n2\nmillion for the excess of equity-based compensation deductions over amounts recorded based on the grant date fair value.\n10\nPension and Other Benefit Programs\nThe Company maintains pension and postretirement medical benefit plans covering certain of its employees not covered by union or industry-wide plans. The Company has defined benefit pension plans that cover employees hired prior to January 1, 2012. For employees hired after this date, the Company has a defined contribution plan. Benefits under these pension plans are generally based on years of service and/or compensation and generally require\n3\nyears of vesting service. Employees generally hired after January 1, 1987 for certain of our media businesses and other employees generally hired after January 1, 1994 are not eligible for postretirement medical benefits.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company measures the actuarial value of its benefit obligations and plan assets for its defined benefit pension and postretirement medical benefit plans at September 30 and adjusts for any plan contributions or significant events between September 30 and our fiscal year end.\nThe following chart summarizes the benefit obligations, assets, funded status and balance sheet impacts associated with the defined benefit pension and postretirement medical benefit plans:\n(1)\nThe actuarial loss for fiscal 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine the fiscal year-end benefit obligation from the rate that was used in the preceding fiscal year\n.\n(2)\nThe amount in fiscal 2023 was due to a change in postretirement medical benefit options.\n102\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) are as follows:\n(1)\nThe amortization of prior-year service credits is related to a change in postretirement medical benefit options.\nIn fiscal 2025, we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to be negligible.\nAOCI, before tax, as of September 28, 2024 consists of the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit cost:\nPlan Funded Status\nAs of September 28, 2024, the projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $\n1.4\nbillion and $\n1.3\nbillion, respectively, and the aggregate fair value of plan assets was not material. As of September 30, 2023, the projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion, respectively, and the aggregate fair value of plan assets was not material.\nAs of September 28, 2024, the projected benefit obligation for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets was $\n1.4\nbillion and the aggregate fair value of plan assets was not material. As of September 30, 2023, the projected benefit obligation for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets was $\n1.2\nbillion and the aggregate fair value of plan assets was not material.\n103\nThe Company’s total accumulated pension benefit obligations at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were $\n15.7\nbillion and $\n13.8\nbillion, respectively. Approximately\n98\n% was vested as of both September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nThe accumulated postretirement medical benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for postretirement medical plans with accumulated postretirement medical benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $\n1.0\nbillion and $\n0.9\nbillion, respectively, at September 28, 2024 and $\n1.0\nbillion and $\n0.8\nbillion, respectively, at September 30, 2023.\nPlan Assets\nA significant portion of the assets of the Company’s defined benefit plans are managed in a third-party master trust. The investment policy and allocation of the assets in the master trust were approved by the Company’s Investment and Administrative Committee, which has oversight responsibility for the Company’s retirement plans.\nThe investment policy ranges for the major asset classes are as follows:\nThe primary investment objective for the assets within the master trust is the prudent and cost effective management of assets to satisfy benefit obligations to plan participants. Financial risks are managed through diversification of plan assets, selection of investment managers and through the investment guidelines incorporated in investment management agreements. Investments are monitored to assess whether returns are commensurate with risks taken.\nThe long-term asset allocation policy for the master trust was established taking into consideration a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the average age of participants, the number of retirees, the duration of liabilities and the expected payout ratio. Liquidity needs of the master trust are generally managed using cash generated by investments or by liquidating securities.\nAssets are generally managed by external investment managers pursuant to investment management agreements that establish permitted securities and risk controls commensurate with the account’s investment strategy. Some agreements permit the use of derivative securities (futures, options, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps) that enable investment managers to enhance returns and manage exposures within their accounts.\nFair Value Measurements of Plan Assets\nFair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and is generally classified in one of the following categories of the fair value hierarchy:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\nLevel 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets\nLevel 3 – Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable\nInvestments that are valued using the net asset value (NAV) (or its equivalent) practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy disclosure. NAV per share is determined based on the fair value using the underlying assets divided by the number of units outstanding.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets reported at fair value. The methodologies used at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are the same.\nLevel 1 investments are valued based on reported market prices on the last trading day of the fiscal year. Investments in common and preferred stocks and mutual funds are valued based on the securities’ exchange-listed price or a broker’s quote in an active market. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities are valued based on a broker’s quote in an active market.\nLevel 2 investments in government and federal agency bonds and notes (excluding U.S. Treasury securities), corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and asset-backed securities are valued using a broker’s quote in a non-active market or an evaluated price based on a compilation of reported market information, such as benchmark yield curves, credit spreads and estimated default rates. Derivative financial instruments are valued based on models that incorporate observable inputs for the underlying securities, such as interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.\n104\nThe Company’s defined benefit plan assets are summarized by level in the following tables:\n(1)\nIncludes\n2.9\nmillion shares of Company common stock valued at $\n278\nmillion and\n2.9\nmillion shares valued at $\n235\nmillion at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nUncalled Capital Commitments\nAlternative investments held by the master trust include interests in funds that have rights to make capital calls to the investors. In such cases, the master trust would be contractually obligated to make a cash contribution at the time of the capital call. At September 28, 2024, the total committed capital still uncalled and unpaid was $\n1.5\nbillion.\nPlan Contributions\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company made $\n95\nmillion of contributions to its pension and postretirement medical plans. The Company currently does not expect to make material pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2025. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2025 will be determined based on a January 1, 2025 funding actuarial valuation, which is expected to be received during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n105\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments for the next ten fiscal years:\n(1)\nEstimated future benefit payments are net of expected Medicare subsidy receipts of $\n36\nmillion.\nAssumptions\nAssumptions, such as discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets and the healthcare cost trend rate, have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic benefit cost as well as the related benefit obligations.\nDiscount Rate\n— The assumed discount rate for pension and postretirement medical plans reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves. The Company measures service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows.\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets\n— The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments. When determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which the Company expects the pension funds to be invested.\nThe following long-term rates of return by asset class were considered in setting the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption:\nHealthcare cost trend rate\n— The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement medical benefit plans. The 2024 actuarial valuation assumed a\n7.00\n% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare claims with the rate decreasing in even increments over nineteen years until reaching\n4.00\n%.\nSensitivity\n—\nA one percentage point change in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects as of September 28, 2024 and for fiscal 2025:\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans\nThe Company participates in a number of multiemployer pension plans under union and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees and expenses its contributions to these plans as incurred. These plans generally provide for retirement, death and/or termination benefits for eligible employees within the applicable collective bargaining units, based on specific eligibility/participation requirements, vesting periods and benefit formulas. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans. For example:\n•\nAssets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\n•\nIf a participating employer stops contributing to the multiemployer plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining participating employers.\n106\n•\nIf a participating employer chooses to stop participating in these multiemployer plans, the employer may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan.\nThe Company also participates in several multiemployer health and welfare plans that cover both active and retired employees. Health care benefits are provided to participants who meet certain eligibility requirements under the applicable collective bargaining unit.\nThe following table sets forth our contributions to multiemployer pension and health and welfare benefit plans:\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company has defined contribution retirement plans for domestic employees who began service after December 31, 2011 and are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plans. In general, the Company contributes from\n3\n% to\n9\n% of an employee’s compensation depending on the employee’s age and years of service with the Company up to plan limits. The Company also has savings and investment plans for which the Company generally matches\n50\n% of employee contributions up to plan limits. In fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the costs of our domestic and international defined contribution plans were $\n408\nmillion, $\n378\nmillion and $\n325\nmillion, respectively.\n11\nEquity\nDividends\nOn February 7, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $\n0.45\nper share ($\n0.8\nbillion) with respect to the first half of fiscal 2024, which was paid in July 2024 to shareholders of record as of July 8, 2024.\nOn November 30, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $\n0.30\nper share ($\n0.5\nbillion) with respect to the second half of fiscal 2023, which was paid in January 2024 to shareholders of record as of December 11, 2023.\nThe Company did not declare or pay a dividend with respect to fiscal 2022 operations.\nShare Repurchase Program\nEffective February 7, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase a total of\n400\nmillion shares of its common stock. During the year ended September 28, 2024, the Company repurchased\n28\nmillion shares of its common stock for $\n3.0\nbillion (excluding the one percent excise tax on stock repurchases imposed by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022). As of September 28, 2024, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase approximately\n372\nmillion additional shares. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) including our proportional share of equity method investee amounts:\n107\nDetails about AOCI components reclassified to net income are as follows:\n108\n12\nEquity-Based Compensation\nUnder various plans, the Company may grant stock options and other equity-based awards to executive, management, technology and creative personnel. The Company’s approach to long-term incentive compensation contemplates awards of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). Certain RSUs awarded to senior executives vest based upon the achievement of market or performance conditions (Performance RSUs).\nStock options are generally granted with a\n10\nyear term at exercise prices equal to or exceeding the market price at the date of grant and become exercisable ratably over a three-year period from the grant date (exercisable ratably over a four-year period from the grant date for awards granted prior to fiscal 2021). At the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, options can occasionally extend up to\n15\nyears after date of grant. RSUs generally vest ratably over three years (four years for grants awarded prior to fiscal 2021) and Performance RSUs generally fully vest after three years, subject to achieving market or performance conditions. Equity-based award grants generally provide continued vesting, in the event of termination, for employees that reach age 60 or greater, have at least ten years of service and have held the award for at least one year.\nEach share granted subject to a stock option award reduces the number of shares available under the Company’s stock incentive plans by one share while each share granted subject to a RSU award reduces the number of shares available by two shares. As of September 28, 2024, the maximum number of shares available for issuance under the Company’s stock incentive plans (assuming all the awards are in the form of stock options) was approximately\n146\nmillion shares and the number available for issuance assuming all awards are in the form of RSUs was approximately\n73\nmillion shares. The Company satisfies stock option exercises and vesting of RSUs with newly issued shares. Stock options and RSUs are generally forfeited by employees who terminate prior to vesting.\nEach year, generally during the first half of the year, the Company awards stock options and restricted stock units to a broad-based group of management, technology and creative personnel. The fair value of options is estimated based on the binomial valuation model. The binomial valuation model takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate. The binomial valuation model also considers the expected exercise multiple (the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average) and the termination rate (the probability of a vested option being canceled due to the termination of the option holder) in computing the value of the option.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the option-valuation model were as follows:\nAlthough the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date, changes in the Company’s assumptions may change the value of, and therefore the expense related to, future stock option grants. The assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the expected volatility and expected exercise multiple. Increases or decreases in either the expected volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease, respectively. The volatility assumption considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the Company’s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions.\nCompensation expense for RSUs and stock options is recognized ratably over the service period of the award. Compensation expense for RSUs is based on the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the grant date. Compensation expense for Performance RSUs reflects the estimated probability that the market or performance conditions will be met.\n109\nCompensation expense related to stock options and RSUs is as follows:\n(1)\nEquity-based compensation expense is net of capitalized equity-based compensation and estimated forfeitures and excludes amortization of previously capitalized equity-based compensation costs.\nThe following table summarizes information about stock option transactions in fiscal 2024 (shares in millions):\nThe following tables summarize information about stock options vested and expected to vest at September 28, 2024 (shares in millions):\n(1)\nNumber of options expected to vest is total unvested options less estimated forfeitures.\n110\nThe following table summarizes information about RSU transactions in fiscal 2024 (shares in millions):\n(1)\nIncludes\n0.4\nmillion Performance RSUs.\n(2)\nIncludes\n1.1\nmillion Performance RSUs.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair values of options granted during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n32.09\n, $\n33.18\nand $\n46.76\n, respectively, and for RSUs were $\n94.23\n, $\n89.66\nand $\n136.36\n, respectively. The total intrinsic value (market value on date of exercise less exercise price) of options exercised and RSUs vested during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 totaled $\n1,322\nmillion, $\n829\nmillion and $\n982\nmillion, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values of stock options vested and expected to vest at September 28, 2024 were $\n10.1\nmillion and $\n12.7\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of September 28, 2024, unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and RSUs was $\n72\nmillion and $\n1,809\nmillion, respectively. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.1\nyears for stock options and\n1.2\nyears for RSUs.\nCash received from option exercises for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n88\nmillion, $\n52\nmillion and $\n127\nmillion, respectively. Tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with option exercises and RSU vestings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $\n275\nmillion, $\n190\nmillion and $\n219\nmillion, respectively.\n13\nDetail of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts\n111\n(1)\nIndefinite lived intangible assets consist of ESPN, Pixar and Marvel trademarks and television FCC licenses.\n112\n14\nCommitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nThe Company has various contractual commitments for rights to sports, films and other programming, totaling approximately $\n92.2\nbillion, including approximately $\n2.6\nbillion for available programming as of September 28, 2024. The Company also has contractual commitments for the construction of cruise ships, creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. Creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports, television and radio personalities and executives.\nContractual commitments for sports programming rights, other programming rights and other commitments including cruise ships and creative talent are as follows:\n(1)\nPrimarily relates to rights for NBA, NFL, college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, tennis, soccer, NHL, WNBA, MLB, UFC and golf. Certain sports programming rights have payments that are variable based primarily on revenues and are not included in the table above.\n(2)\nThe table above excludes commitments related to our Star India businesses that are held for sale of approximately $\n4.5\nbillion primarily related to sports programming rights.\nLegal Matters\nOn May 12, 2023, a private securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer, Robert Chapek, its former Chief Financial Officer, Christine M. McCarthy, and the former Chairman of the Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, Kareem Daniel on behalf of certain purchasers of securities of the Company (the “Securities Class Action”). On November 6, 2023, a consolidated complaint was filed in the same action, adding Robert Iger, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as a defendant. Claims in the Securities Class Action include (i) violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against all defendants, (ii) violations of Section 20A of the Exchange Act against Iger and McCarthy, and (iii) violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants. Plaintiffs in the Securities Class Action allege purported misstatements and omissions concerning, and a scheme to conceal, accurate costs and subscriber growth of the Disney+ platform. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, plus interest and costs and fees. The Company intends to defend against the lawsuit vigorously and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on December 21, 2023. A hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on September 27, 2024. The lawsuit is in the early stages and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.\nThree shareholder derivative complaints have been filed. The first, in which Hugues Gervat is the plaintiff, was filed on August 4, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The second, in which Stourbridge Investments LLC is the plaintiff, was filed on August 23, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. And the third, in which Audrey McAdams is the Plaintiff, was filed on December 15, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Each named The Walt Disney Company as a nominal defendant and alleged claims on its behalf against the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Robert Iger; its former Chief Executive Officer, Robert Chapek; its former Chief Financial Officer, Christine M. McCarthy; the former Chairman of the Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, Kareem Daniel, and ten current and former members of the Disney Board (Susan E. Arnold; Mary T. Barra; Safra A. Catz; Amy L. Chang; Francis A. deSouza; Michael B.G. Froman; Maria Elena Lagomasino; Calvin R. McDonald; Mark G. Parker; and Derica W. Rice). Along with alleged violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a), 20(a), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act, premised on similar allegations as the Securities Class Action, plaintiffs seek to recover under various theories including breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste. On October 24, 2023, the Stourbridge action was voluntarily dismissed and, on November 16, 2023, was refiled in Delaware state court alleging analogous theories of liability based on state law. On October 30, 2023, the Gervat action was stayed pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss filed in the Securities Class Action. The Stourbridge action was likewise stayed under an order entered December 12, 2023 and the McAdams action was stayed under an order entered February 20, 2024. The actions seek declarative and injunctive relief, an award of unspecified damages to The Walt Disney Company and other costs and fees. The Company intends to defend against\n113\nthese lawsuits vigorously. The lawsuits are in the early stages, and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.\nOn November 18, 2022, a private antitrust putative class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company on behalf of a putative class of certain subscribers to YouTube TV (the “Biddle Action”). The plaintiffs in the Biddle Action asserted a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act based on allegations that Disney uses certain pricing and packaging provisions in its carriage agreements with virtual multichannel video distributors (“vMVPDs”) to increase prices for and reduce output of certain services offered by vMVPDs. On November 30, 2022, a second private antitrust putative class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company on behalf of a putative class of certain subscribers to DirecTV Stream (the “Fendelander Action”), making similar allegations. The Company filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim in both the Biddle Action and Fendelander Action on January 31, 2023. On September 30, 2023, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Company’s motions to dismiss both cases and, on October 13, 2023, the court issued an order consolidating both cases. On October 16, 2023, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint (the “Consolidated Complaint”). The Consolidated Complaint asserts claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and certain Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, and Tennessee antitrust laws based on substantially similar allegations as the Biddle Action and the Fendelander Action. The Consolidated Complaint seeks injunctive relief, unspecified money damages and costs and fees. The Company intends to defend against the lawsuits vigorously and filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint for failure to state a claim on December 1, 2023. The Company’s motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint was granted in part and denied in part on June 25, 2024. On September 12, 2024, the Court entered a case management order setting, among other dates, Plaintiffs’ deadline to file their class certification motion on March 27, 2026. The consolidated lawsuit is in the early stages, and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.\nOn February 20, 2024, a private antitrust lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company (including affiliates ESPN, Inc., ESPN Enterprises, Inc., and Hulu, LLC), Fox Corporation, and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”), by fuboTV Inc. and fuboTV Media Inc. (together, “Fubo”). Fubo asserts claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and New York antitrust law based on the theories that (a) a planned joint venture between ESPN, Inc., Fox Corporation, and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., which will distribute certain of Defendants’ linear networks to consumers (the “Sports Streaming JV”), will harm competition in alleged markets for the licensing of networks that offer live sports content and for streaming live pay tv, (b) certain alleged practices by which the Company and Fox Corporation license their networks to vMVPDs as a bundle increase prices and reduce output for services offered by vMVPDs, and (c) certain alleged pricing provisions in Defendants’ carriage agreements with YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, as well as in Hulu + Live TV’s carriage agreements with non-Defendant programmers, increase prices for services offered by vMVPDs. On April 8, 2024, Fubo filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against Defendants to prevent the formation of the Sports Streaming JV. On April 29, 2024, Fubo filed an amended complaint to add allegations of a purported market for “skinny sports bundles”, which Fubo claims the Sports Streaming JV will monopolize after its launch. After a hearing on Fubo’s motion for preliminary injunction, the district court granted Fubo’s motion on August 16, 2024, and enjoined the launch of the joint venture. On August 19, 2024, Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the order for a preliminary injunction. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has granted Defendants’ motion to expedite the appeal. Fubo further seeks injunctive relief, unspecified money damages and costs and fees. On September 26, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Fubo’s claims brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and New York antitrust law, unrelated to the joint venture. The district court has set trial on all claims for October 6, 2025. The Company intends to defend against the lawsuit vigorously and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.\nIn May 2024, the Company and NBCU entered into a confidential arbitration to resolve a dispute regarding the contractual appraisal process related to the determination of Hulu’s equity fair value, in which the parties seek declaratory relief, equitable relief and unspecified damages. See Note 2 for a more detailed discussion of the arbitration and the determination of Hulu’s equity fair value.\nThe Company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and officers, is a defendant in various other legal actions involving copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct of its businesses. Management does not believe that the Company has incurred a probable material loss by reason of any of those actions.\n15\nLeases\nThe Company’s operating leases primarily consist of real estate and equipment, including office space for general and administrative purposes, production facilities, land, cruise terminals, retail outlets and distribution centers for consumer products. The Company also has finance leases, primarily for broadcast equipment and land.\n114\nSome of our leases include renewal and/or termination options. If it is reasonably certain that a renewal or termination option will be exercised, the exercise of the option is considered in calculating the term of the lease. As of September 28, 2024, our operating leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately\n10\nyears, and our finance leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately\n35\nyears. The weighted-average incremental borrowing rate is\n4.0\n% and\n6.7\n%, for our operating leases and finance leases, respectively. At September 28, 2024, total estimated future lease payments for non-cancelable lease agreements that have not commenced are not material.\nThe Company’s operating and finance right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are as follows:\n(1)\nIncluded in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2)\nIncluded in “Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(3)\nIncluded in “Other long-term liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe components of lease costs are as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes variable lease payments related to our operating and finance leases and costs of leases with initial terms of less than one year.\nCash paid during the year for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities is as follows:\n115\nFuture minimum lease payments, as of September 28, 2024, are as follows:\nLessor Arrangements\nThe Company leases certain of its land and buildings to third parties, primarily at its parks and experiences businesses. Lessee payments include fixed amounts for the rental of the property although the vast majority of the payments are variable based on a percentage of lessee sales. Revenues recognized on these leases for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n0.6\nbillion\n, $\n0.5\nbillion\nand $\n0.4\nbillion\n, respectively.\n16\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value are summarized in the following tables by fair value measurement Level. See Note 10 for definitions of fair value measures and the Levels within the fair value hierarchy.\n116\nThe fair value of Level 2 investments are primarily determined based on an internal valuation model that uses observable inputs such as stock trading price, volatility and risk free rate.\nThe fair values of Level 2 derivatives are primarily determined by internal discounted cash flow models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign currency exchange rates. Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 17.\nLevel 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.\nLevel 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.\nThe Company’s financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.\nNon-recurring Fair Value Measure\nThe Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18. Fair value was determined using estimated discounted future cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique (see Note 2 for a discussion of the more significant inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis).\nCredit Concentrations\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments on an ongoing basis and does not currently anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\nThe Company does not expect that it would realize a material loss, based on the fair value of its derivative financial instruments as of September 28, 2024, in the event of nonperformance by any single derivative counterparty. The Company generally enters into derivative transactions only with counterparties that have a credit rating of A- or better and requires collateral in the event credit ratings fall below A- or aggregate exposures exceed limits as defined by contract. In addition, the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.\nThe Company does not have material cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that have below investment grade credit ratings and maintains short-term liquidity balances in high quality money market funds. At September 28, 2024, the Company’s balances (excluding money market funds) with individual financial institutions that exceeded 10% of the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents were\n24\n% of total cash and cash equivalents. At September 30,\n117\n2023, the Company had no balances (excluding money market funds) with financial institutions that exceeded 10% of the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents.\nThe Company’s trade receivables and financial investments do not represent a significant concentration of credit risk at September 28, 2024 due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which the Company’s products are sold, the dispersion of our customers across geographic areas and the diversification of the Company’s portfolio among financial institutions.\n17\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company manages its exposure to various risks relating to its ongoing business operations according to a risk management policy. The primary risks managed with derivative instruments are interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.\nThe Company’s derivative positions measured at fair value (see Note 16) are summarized in the following tables:\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through its borrowing activities. The Company’s objective is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and on the market value of its borrowings. In accordance with its policy, the Company targets its fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage. The Company primarily uses pay-floating and pay-fixed interest rate swaps to facilitate its interest rate risk management activities.\n118\nThe Company designates pay-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings effectively converting fixed-rate borrowings to variable-rate borrowings. The total notional amount of the Company’s pay-floating interest rate swaps at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was $\n12.0\nbillion and $\n13.5\nbillion, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes fair value hedge adjustments to hedged borrowings:\nThe following amounts are included in “Interest expense, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Income:\nThe Company may designate pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest expense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nForeign Exchange Risk Management\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company’s net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $\n9.9\nbillion and $\n8.3\nbillion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $\n99\nmillion.\nThe following table summarizes the effect of foreign exchange cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n(1)\nPrimarily recorded in revenue.\nThe Company may designate cross-currency swaps as fair value hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings. The impact from the change in foreign currency on both the cross-currency swap and borrowing is recorded to “Interest expense, net”. The impact from interest rate changes is recorded in AOCI and is amortized over the life of the cross-currency swap. As of both September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the total notional amount of the Company’s designated cross-currency swaps\n119\nwas Canadian $\n1.3\nbillion ($\n1.0\nbillion). As of both September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company also had Canadian $\n1.3\nbillion ($\n0.9\nbillion) in cross-currency swaps, which were not designated as hedges and matured in October 2024. The related gains or losses recognized in earnings for the fiscal years ended 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nForeign exchange risk management contracts with respect to foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The net notional amount of these foreign exchange contracts (including our non-designated cross-currency swaps) at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were $\n3.4\nbillion and $\n3.1\nbillion, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the net foreign exchange gains or losses recognized on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the net foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate our exposure with respect to foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities by the corresponding line item in which they are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income:\nCommodity Price Risk Management\nThe Company is subject to the volatility of commodities prices, and the Company designates certain commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of commodity purchases. The notional amount of these commodities contracts at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and related gains or losses recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nRisk Management – Other Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges\nThe Company enters into certain other risk management contracts that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. These contracts, which include certain total return swap contracts, are intended to offset economic exposures of the Company and are carried at market value with any changes in value recorded in earnings. The notional amount of these contracts at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were $\n0.5\nbillion and $\n0.4\nbillion, respectively. The related gains or losses recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nContingent Features and Cash Collateral\nThe Company has master netting arrangements by counterparty with respect to certain derivative financial instrument contracts. The Company may be required to post collateral in the event that a net liability position with a counterparty exceeds limits defined by contract and that vary with the Company’s credit rating. In addition, these contracts may require a counterparty to post collateral to the Company in the event that a net receivable position with a counterparty exceeds limits defined by contract and that vary with the counterparty’s credit rating. If the Company’s or the counterparty’s credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, such counterparties or the Company would also have the right to terminate our derivative contracts, which could lead to a net payment to or from the Company for the aggregate net value by counterparty of our derivative contracts. The aggregate fair values of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a net liability position by counterparty were $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.6\nbillion at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n120\n18\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges\nA summary of restructuring and impairment charges is as follows:\nStar India\nIn fiscal 2024, we recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $\n1.5\nbillion related to the Star India Transaction.\nGoodwill\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as a result of Star India assets and liabilities being classified as held for sale, they were removed from the entertainment goodwill reporting units along with a proportional amount of goodwill. As a result, we evaluated the residual goodwill at our entertainment DTC services and linear networks reporting units for impairment. Star sports was a standalone reporting unit which did not have any goodwill.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test as part of our annual goodwill impairment assessment.\nThese evaluations resulted in non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $\n0.7\nbillion and $\n0.6\nbillion at our entertainment linear networks reporting unit in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, respectively. Goodwill was not impaired at the entertainment DTC services reporting unit.\nIn addition, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment assessment in fiscal 2023, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to our entertainment and international sports linear networks reporting units of $\n0.7\nbillion.\nContent\nWe recorded charges of $\n0.2\nbillion and $\n2.6\nbillion, in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively, as a result of our strategic changes in approach to content curation. The fiscal 2024 charges related to the removal of produced content from our entertainment linear networks and DTC services. The fiscal 2023 charges included $\n2.0\nbillion related to the removal of produced content from our entertainment DTC services and $\n0.6\nbillion related to the termination of certain third-party license agreements for the right to use content primarily on our entertainment DTC services. We paid approximately $\n0.4\nbillion of cash to terminate these license agreements.\nOther\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company recorded charges of $\n0.3\nbillion for asset impairments at our retail business, $\n0.2\nbillion for impairments of equity investments and $\n0.1\nbillion of severance. In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded charges of $\n0.4\nbillion of severance, $\n0.1\nbillion for impairment of an equity investment and $\n0.1\nbillion for exiting our businesses in Russia. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded charges of $\n0.2\nbillion, primarily due to asset impairments related to exiting our businesses in Russia.\n19\nNew Accounting Pronouncements and Other Disclosure Rules\nImprovements to Reportable Segments Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to enhance reportable segment disclosures by requiring the disclosure of significant expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included in the segment’s measure of profit or loss. It also requires an explanation of how the CODM uses the segment’s measure of profit or loss to assess segment performance and allocate resources. The guidance is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning in fiscal year 2025 and for interim periods beginning in fiscal year 2026 and requires retrospective adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impacts of the new guidance on its financial statement disclosures.\n121\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance income tax disclosures. The new guidance requires an expanded effective tax rate reconciliation, the disclosure of cash taxes paid segregated between U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign, with further disaggregation by jurisdiction if certain thresholds are met and eliminates certain disclosures related to uncertain tax benefits. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning with the Company’s 2026 fiscal year (with early adoption permitted). The Company is currently assessing the impacts of the new guidance on its financial statement disclosures.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expense\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance that requires the disclosure of additional information related to certain costs and expenses, including amounts of inventory purchases, employee compensation, and depreciation and amortization included in each income statement line item. The guidance also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and the Company’s definition of selling expenses. The guidance is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning in fiscal year 2028 and for interim periods beginning in fiscal year 2029. The Company is currently assessing the impacts of the new guidance on its financial statement disclosures.\nEnhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures\nIn March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules that will require disclosure of:\n•\nCertain climate-related information including climate-related risks, targets, and goals that are reasonably likely to have a material impact, as applicable, on a company’s strategy, business, results of operations or financial condition;\n•\nCertain greenhouse gas emissions, if material; and\n•\nCertain financial information regarding the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions within the notes to the financial statements\nThe new rules are applicable to annual reporting periods and will be phased in beginning with the Company’s 2026 fiscal year. In April 2024, given pending legal challenges, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order to voluntarily stay the new rules.\n122"
