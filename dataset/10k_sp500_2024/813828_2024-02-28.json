    "text": "Overview\nWe are a leading global media, streaming and entertainment company that creates premium content and experiences for audiences worldwide. Driven by iconic consumer brands, our portfolio includes CBS, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, Paramount+ and Pluto TV. We hold one of the industry’s most extensive libraries of television and film titles. In addition to offering innovative streaming services and digital video products, we also provide powerful capabilities in production, distribution and advertising solutions.\nOur strategy is grounded in producing world-class content with global appeal; distributing content across platforms to reach viewers globally; and monetizing our content across multiple revenue streams to maximize return on investment. As we execute in line with this strategy, we are focused on driving to\nDirect-to-Consumer\nprofitability and maximizing cash flow from our traditional businesses.\nIn 2023, we demonstrated the continued breadth and depth of our content capabilities across our distribution platforms — a growing subscription streaming service, Paramount+; a leading free advertising-supported streaming television (“FAST”) service, Pluto TV; an iconic Hollywood studio, Paramount Pictures; broadcast, including the leading network in the United States (the “U.S.”), CBS; and a portfolio of cable networks that includes Nickelodeon, MTV and BET.\n2023 marked significant progress in the building of a scaled, streaming business with narrowed losses, delivering growth in engagement and revenue. Benefiting from a slate of original series, including\nTulsa King\n,\nMayor of Kingstown\n,\n1923\n,\nSpecial Ops: Lioness\n,\nYellowjackets\nand\nThe Chi\n, Paramount+ subscribers grew 21% year-over-year to 67.5 million. According to subscription analytics firm Antenna, Paramount+ was the number one premium streaming service in domestic sign-ups and gross paid subscriber additions since its launch in March 2021 through the end of 2023 and had the most sign-ups in 2023. Additionally, Paramount now reaches audiences in the top 10 streaming markets globally, and in free, Pluto TV continues to be in more countries than any other FAST service.\nParamount Pictures released five films in 2023 that debuted at number one at the domestic box office —\nScream VI\n,\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\n,\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts\n,\nMission: Impossible – Dead\nI-1\nReckoning Part One\nand\nPAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie\n. Our franchise-focused strategy delivered at the box office, and also drove additional content consumption on linear, streaming and in retail.\nCBS finished the 2022-2023 season as America’s number one broadcast network in primetime for the 15th consecutive season. The NFL on CBS delivered its most-watched regular season and postseason since the league returned to CBS in 1998, and CBS News finished the year with four shows at number one in their respective categories, including\n60 Minutes\n,\nCBS News Sunday Morning\n,\nFace the Nation\nand\n48 Hours\n. This season, we expanded our partnership with the Big Ten, adding football to our longstanding basketball coverage, as part of a multiplatform agreement that extends through the end of the decade.\nOur portfolio of cable networks attracted audiences through a broad range of shows, with four of the top five cable series among adults 18 to 34. Notably, Nickelodeon delivered the number one preschool property among kids two to five in\nPaw Patrol\nand the number one animation property among kids two to 11 in\nSpongeBob\nin total television viewing minutes.\nIn 2023, we continued to harness the power of partnerships to extend our reach to even more audiences. We completed the first year of our Walmart+ partnership and expanded the offering to include access to Pluto TV for customers in addition to Paramount+. We also launched Paramount+ on the subscription hub for Verizon +Play customers, and partnered with Delta Air Lines to offer Delta SkyMiles Members in-flight access to the platform on flights originating in the U.S. In addition, we continued to expand our global streaming reach, highlighted by the launch of a partnership with J:COM and WOWOW in Japan.\nNotably, we took significant steps to further optimize our business and right size our asset base. At the end of June, we launched the integration of Paramount+ and SHOWTIME, which has since driven increases in subscriber acquisition, engagement and operational efficiency. In October, we completed the sale of Simon & Schuster for $1.6 billion, and we used the majority of the net proceeds to pay down debt, which improved our leverage.\nWe continued our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) in 2023. We hosted our sixth annual Global Inclusion Week, a week-long initiative featuring conversations, panels and workshops designed to ensure our workforce and culture reflect, celebrate and elevate the diversity of our audiences and communities. We also continued to advance Content for Change, a companywide initiative designed to use the power of our content, creative supply chain and culture to counteract bias, stereotypes and hate. We released our fourth Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Report, and made progress on our ESG strategy and goals across our three focus areas: (1) On-Screen Content & Social Impact, (2) Workforce & Culture and (3) Sustainable Production & Operations. We also hosted our 27th annual Community Day, a global day of community service focused on causes and issues that resonate with our employees and audiences.\nWe operate through the following segments:\n•\nTV Media.\nOur\nTV Media\nsegment consists of our (1) domestic and international broadcast networks and owned television stations; (2) domestic cable networks and international extensions of certain of our domestic cable network brands; and (3) domestic and international television studio operations, and production and distribution of first-run syndicated programming.\nTV Media\ngenerated approximately 68% of our consolidated revenues in 2023.\n•\nDirect-to-Consumer.\nOur\nDirect-to-Consumer\nsegment includes our portfolio of domestic and international pay and free streaming services.\nDirect-to-Consumer\ngenerated approximately 22% of our consolidated revenues in 2023.\n•\nFilmed Entertainment.\nOur\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment consists of the production and acquisition of films, series and short-form content for release and licensing around the world, including in theaters, on streaming services, on television, and through digital home entertainment and DVDs/Blu-rays.\nFilmed Entertainment\ngenerated approximately 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2023.\nI-2\nWe were organized as a Delaware corporation in 1986.

In 2023, we released our fourth ESG Report, which is available on our website and includes an update on the progress we have made in each focus area.\nESG Governance\nOur ESG team oversees the day-to-day strategy and implementation of our ESG efforts under the leadership of a steering committee, comprised of senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. We also have multiple working groups dedicated to specific ESG topics comprised of subject matter experts from across our brands and functional teams, which together with the steering committee constitute our ESG Council. Our ESG Council actively reviews and refines our ESG strategy and the ESG team regularly updates senior management, our Board of Directors and its Nominating and Governance Committee, which, pursuant to its charter, oversees and monitors significant issues impacting our culture and reputation, as well as our handling of ESG matters.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe work to create a culture that is welcoming and a workplace where our employees and talent feel supported and have the opportunity to thrive. Our human capital management strategy is intended to address the areas described below. Additional information can be found in our ESG Report.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 21,900 full- and part-time employees in 33 countries worldwide and had approximately 4,500 project-based staff on our payroll.

Our\nTV Media\nbusinesses compete for distribution of our program services (and receipt of related fees) with other television networks and programmers. We also compete with other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently-owned television stations to ensure the effective distribution of network programming in the U.S. We compete with studios and other producers of entertainment content for distribution on third-party platforms.\nFor additional information regarding competition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry.”\nRegulation\nOur businesses are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as laws and regulations of countries other than the U.S. and pan-national bodies such as the European Union (“E.U.”). The laws and regulations affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change, as are the protections that those laws and regulations afford us. The discussion below describes certain, but not all, laws and regulations affecting our businesses.\nFCC and Similar Regulation\nThe FCC regulates broadcast television, some aspects of cable network programming, and certain programming delivered by internet protocol in the U.S., pursuant to U.S. federal law, including the Communications Act. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, the imposition of reporting obligations, limited renewals of broadcast station licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. Our international free-to-air networks are subject to the local rules and regulations of foreign regulators, including the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in Australia; the Office of Communications (Ofcom) in the U.K.; Ente Nacional de Comunicaciones (ENACOM) in Argentina; and the Consejo Nacional de Televisión (CNTV) in Chile.\nLicense Renewals and Transfers\nEach of our owned television stations in the U.S. must be licensed by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are typically granted for eight-year terms, and we must obtain renewals as they expire to continue operating our stations. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that (1) the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (2) with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or FCC regulations; and (3) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. A station remains authorized to operate while its license renewal application is pending. In addition, the Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee.\nBroadcast Ownership Regulation\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules impose local and national ownership limits on broadcast television stations, as well as ownership limits on certain broadcast networks, in the U.S. The broadcast ownership rules discussed below are the most relevant to our U.S. operations.\nLocal Television Ownership\nThe FCC’s local television ownership rule generally prohibits common ownership of two full-power stations in a market unless at least one of the stations is not a top-four ranked station in the market based on audience share at the time of acquisition of the second station. In certain circumstances, the rule also restricts broadcasters from\nI-9\nmaintaining two or more top-four ranked broadcast channels in the same market via use of a station’s multicast channels or a low-power television station. However, the FCC may permit such common ownership if it finds such ownership would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.\nDual Network Rule\nThe dual network rule prohibits any of the four major U.S. broadcast networks — ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC — from combining or being under common control.\nTelevision National Audience Reach Limitation\nUnder the national television ownership rule, one party may not own, or have an attributable interest under the FCC’s rules in, television stations that reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. For purposes of this rule, a UHF station is afforded a “discount” and is therefore attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market. We currently own and operate television stations that reach approximately 37% of all U.S. television households, but we are attributed with reaching approximately 24% of all such households for purposes of the national ownership rule because of the discount.\nForeign Ownership\nThe Communications Act generally restricts foreign individuals or entities from collectively owning more than 25% of our voting power or equity. FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold. The FCC has approved foreign ownership levels of up to 100% in certain instances, following its review and approval of specific, named foreign individuals.\nCable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by cable system operators, direct broadcast satellite operators, and other MVPDs in the U.S. Pursuant to these regulations, we have elected to negotiate with MVPDs for the right to carry our broadcast television stations via retransmission consent agreements. The Communications Act and FCC regulations require that broadcasters and some categories of MVPDs negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent. Some MVPDs and other third parties have sought changes to federal law that would eliminate or otherwise limit the ability of broadcasters to obtain fair compensation for the grant of retransmission consent.\nProgram Regulation\nThe FCC also regulates the content of broadcast, cable network, and other video programming. The FCC prohibits broadcasters from airing obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. The FCC also monitors compliance with requirements that apply to broadcasters and cable networks relating to political advertising, identification of program sponsors, and the use and integrity of the Emergency Alert System. In addition, FCC regulations require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and/or cable programming, as well as certain programming in the U.S. delivered by internet protocol. Broadcast television stations in certain markets that are affiliated with one of the four major U.S. broadcast networks must also provide a certain amount of programming every quarter that includes audio-narrated description of a program’s key visual elements that make the program accessible to blind and low-vision viewers.\nChildren’s Programming\nOur business is subject to various regulations in the U.S. and abroad applicable to children’s programming. U.S. federal law and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast television stations and cable networks during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and the FCC also limits the display of certain commercial website addresses during children’s programming. Moreover, each of our broadcast television stations in the U.S. is required to air, in general, three hours per week\nI-10\nof programming specifically designed to meet the educational and informational programming needs of children 16 years of age and younger. In addition, some policymakers have sought limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. For example, restrictions on the television advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (“HFSS”) to children aged 15 and younger exist in the U.K. The U.K. government has also announced its intention to impose a ban, effective in October 2025, on all HFSS advertising before 9:00 p.m. on television and a total ban online. Various laws with similar objectives have also been enacted in a number of jurisdictions, and pressure for their introduction elsewhere continues to be felt globally.\nBroadcast Transmission Standard\nFCC rules permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “Next Generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also called “ATSC 3.0.” Full-service television stations using the standard are subject to certain requirements, including the obligation to continue broadcasting a generally identical program stream in the current ATSC 1.0 broadcast standard. The ATSC 3.0 standard can be used to offer better picture quality and improved mobile broadcast viewing. A television station converting to ATSC 3.0 operation will incur significant costs in equipment purchases and upgrades. In addition, consumers may be required to obtain new television sets or other equipment that are capable of receiving ATSC 3.0 broadcasts. We are participating in ATSC 3.0 partnerships with other broadcasters and may enter into additional partnerships in the future.\nGlobal Data Protection Laws and Privacy Laws\nWe are subject to a number of data protection and privacy laws in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws in a number of different U.S. states and the E.U. These laws impact, or may impact, the way we collect, use, transfer, store and secure personal data.

    "text": "A wide range of risks may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, now and in the future. We consider the risks described below to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable factors that could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nIf our streaming business is unsuccessful, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected\nStreaming is intensely competitive and cash intensive and there can be no assurance our streaming business will be profitable or otherwise successful. Our ability to continue to attract, engage and retain streaming subscribers and active users (together, “users”), as well as generate the corresponding subscription and advertising revenues, depends on a number of factors, including our ability to consistently provide appealing and differentiated content that resonates globally, effectively market our content and services, and provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing that content. Our success will require significant investments to produce original content and acquire the rights to third-party content, including sports, as well as the establishment and maintenance of key content and distribution partnerships. If we are unable to manage costs or maintain such partnerships, we may fail to meet our profitability goals.\nIn addition to attracting new users, we must also meaningfully engage existing users with content to minimize “churn” and maximize our advertising and subscription revenues. If we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in attracting, engaging and retaining users, as well as creative talent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. If consumers do not consider our streaming services to be of value compared to competing services, including because we fail to introduce compelling new content and features, do not maintain competitive pricing, especially during economic downturns or other adverse macroeconomic conditions, terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings, change the mix of content in a manner that is unfavorably received, or offer an inferior consumer viewing experience, we may not be able to attract, engage and retain users, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nI-13\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and a decline in advertising revenues has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur advertising revenues have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by advertising market conditions, changes in consumer behavior and deficiencies in audience measurement.\nThe strength of the advertising market can fluctuate, reflecting the impact of general macroeconomic conditions as well as the economic prospects and spending priorities of specific advertisers or industries, and may continue to decline. Our ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for our content, the viewers in our targeted demographics, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers. Natural and other disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could also lead to a reduction in domestic and international advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services and economic uncertainty.\nMajor sports events, such as the Super Bowl and the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament, and state, congressional and presidential elections cycles, may cause our advertising revenues to vary substantially from year to year. Political advertising expenditures are impacted by the ability and willingness of candidates and political action campaigns to spend funds on advertising and the competitive nature of the elections affecting viewers in markets featuring our content.\nThe evolution of consumer preferences toward streaming and other digital services and the increasing number of entertainment choices has intensified audience fragmentation and reduced viewership through traditional linear distribution models, which has caused and may continue to cause ratings and viewership declines for our television networks. This evolution has also given rise to new ways of purchasing advertising, as well as a general shift in total advertising expenditures toward streaming and digital, some of which may not be as beneficial to us as traditional advertising methods. In addition, an increase in the number of advertising-supported streaming offerings has intensified, and may continue to intensify, competition for viewers and advertising. There can be no assurance that we can successfully navigate the evolving streaming and digital advertising market or that the advertising revenues we generate in that market will replace the declines in advertising revenues generated from our traditional linear business.\nAdvertising sales are also largely dependent on audience measurement and could be negatively affected if measurement methodologies do not accurately reflect viewership levels. The industry is currently transitioning to a multiplatform measurement environment in an effort to more completely measure viewership and advertising across linear, streaming and digital, but has not yet established a consistent methodology for such measurement. Currently, the primary measurement technique used in our television advertising sales does not fully measure viewership across streaming and digital platforms. We measure and monetize across our streaming services using census-based advertising-server data establishing the number of impressions served, combined with third-party data providing demographic composition estimates. Multiplatform campaign verification is still not measured by any one consistently applied method. While we expect innovation and standards around multiplatform measurement to benefit us as the advertising market continues to evolve, we are nevertheless partially dependent on third parties to deliver those solutions. Our ability to target and measure audiences is also limited by an increasing number of global laws and regulations.\nWe operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively\nWe face substantial and increasing competition to attract creative talent, to produce and acquire the rights to high-quality content, to acquire and retain users and to distribute our content and services on a variety of third-party platforms. Competition for talent, content, audiences, subscribers, service providers, production infrastructure, advertising and distribution is intense and comes from other television networks and stations, streaming services (including those that provide pirated content), social media, content studios and independent content producers and distributors, consumer products companies and other entertainment outlets and platforms, as well as from\nI-14\n“second screen” applications. We also compete with additional entrants into the market for the production of original content.\nOur competitors include companies with interests in multiple media businesses that are often vertically integrated, as well as companies in adjacent sectors with significant financial, marketing and other resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing. Our competitors may also enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive position. We also rely on third-party platforms with which we compete to make our content available to our users, and if these third parties are unwilling to continue to distribute our content or distribute it on terms that are favorable to us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThese competitive pressures have increased and may continue to increase. Accordingly, the prices we pay for talent and intellectual property rights have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant cost increases. We invest significant resources to produce, market and distribute original content. We also acquire content and ancillary rights and pay related rights fees (including for sports and music rights), license fees, royalties and/or contingent compensation. If these competitive pressures continue to increase, we may not be able to produce or acquire content in a cost-effective manner. We may be outbid by our competitors for the rights to new, popular content or in connection with the renewals of popular rights we currently hold. Accordingly, there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated returns on our investments.\nThis competition could result in a decrease in users, lower ratings and advertising revenues, lower affiliate and other revenues, and increased content costs and promotional and other expenses, which can negatively affect our ability to generate revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that competition in the marketplace will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe unpredictable and constantly shifting nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models, have affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to shifting content consumption patterns, evolving technologies and distribution models. Our ability to maintain attractive brands and to create, distribute and/or license popular content are key to our success and ability to generate revenues. The revenues we generate primarily depend on our ability to consistently anticipate and satisfy consumer tastes and expectations in the U.S. and internationally. Consumer tastes and behavior change frequently, and it is a challenge to anticipate what will be successful at any point in time. The popularity of our original content and the content we acquire from third parties is affected by our ability to target key audiences; the quality and attractiveness of competing content; and the availability and popularity of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities. Declines in the popularity of the content we distribute, including sports for which we have acquired rights, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEvolving technologies affect the demand for our content, how our content is generated, distributed and consumed, the sources and nature of competing content offerings and the options available to advertisers for reaching target audiences, all of which can affect how we generate and maintain predictable revenues and profitability. These developments have impacted certain traditional distribution models, including ones we have historically relied upon, as demonstrated by industrywide declines in broadcast and cable ratings, declines in cable subscribers, the development of alternative distribution platforms for broadcast and cable content and reduced theatergoing. Declines in linear viewership are expected to continue and may accelerate, which could adversely affect our advertising and affiliate revenues.\nThese shifts in consumer behavior may also be exacerbated by future disruptions to our operations, including prolonged disruptions to our ability to create content caused by global events outside our control such as health outbreaks or pandemics similar to COVID-19 or industry-wide strikes similar to what we experienced in 2023.\nI-15\nTo respond to these developments, we regularly consider, and from time to time adopt or develop, new technologies and changes to our business models and strategies to remain competitive, such as our increased investment in streaming. There can be no assurance we will successfully anticipate or respond to these developments, that we will not experience disruption, even as we respond to such developments, or that the new technologies or business models we develop will be as successful or as profitable as historical or existing ones.\nOur ongoing changes in business strategy, including decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services, technologies and other strategic activities, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe have made, and expect to continue to make, changes to our business strategy to effectively respond to market and consumer changes that are subject to execution risk and there can be no assurance they will produce anticipated benefits. As part of our business strategy, we have invested in, and expect to continue to invest in, new businesses, products, services, technologies and other strategic initiatives, including through acquisitions, and strategic partnerships and investments, and enter into restructurings, cost savings and other transformation initiatives. These investments and initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: difficulty integrating acquired businesses; failure to realize anticipated benefits; unanticipated expenses and liabilities; potential disruption to our business and operations; diversion of management’s attention; difficulty managing expanded operations; the loss or inability to retain key employees\nand creative talent; unanticipated challenges to or loss of our relationship with new or existing users, viewers, advertisers, suppliers, distributors and licensors; legal and regulatory limitations;\ninsufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with new investments; and failure to successfully develop an acquired business or technology. Many of these factors are outside of our control, and because new investments are inherently risky, and the anticipated benefits or value of these investments may not materialize, there can be no assurance such investments and other strategic initiatives will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe loss of affiliation and distribution agreements, renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms or adverse interpretations thereof could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nA significant portion of our revenues are attributable to agreements with a limited number of distributors. There can be no assurance these agreements will be renewed in the future, or renewed on favorable terms, including those related to pricing, programming tiers and the types of the rights we grant to distributors. The loss of existing packaging, positioning, pricing or other opportunities and the loss of carriage or the failure to renew our agreements with any distributor, or renew them on favorable terms, could reduce the distribution of our programming and program services and decrease the potential audience for our programs, thereby negatively affecting our growth prospects and revenues from both affiliate fees and advertising. The CBS Network provides affiliated television stations regularly scheduled programming in return for the insertion of network commercials during that programming and the payment of reverse compensation. The loss of such station affiliation agreements could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the reach of our programming and therefore our attractiveness to advertisers, and renewal of these affiliation agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect our results of operations.\nConsolidation among and vertical integration of distributors in the cable and broadcast network businesses have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect our ability to maintain or obtain distribution for our network programming or distribution and/or marketing of our subscription services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Also, consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage. Competitive pressures faced by MVPDs, particularly in light of evolving consumer consumption patterns and new distribution models, could adversely affect the terms of our renewals with MVPDs. In addition, MVPDs continue to develop alternative offerings and to the extent these offerings do not include our content and become widely accepted in lieu of traditional offerings, we could experience a decline in affiliate revenues.\nI-16\nOur revenues are dependent on the compliance of major distributors with the terms of our affiliation or distribution agreements. As these agreements have grown in complexity, the number of disputes regarding their interpretation and even their validity has grown, resulting in greater uncertainty and, from time to time, litigation with respect to our rights and obligations. Some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” (“MFN”) clauses, which provide that if we enter into an agreement with a distributor and such agreement includes terms that are more favorable than those held by a distributor holding an MFN right, we must offer some of those terms to the distributor holding the MFN right. Disagreements with a distributor on the interpretation or validity of an agreement could adversely impact our affiliate and advertising revenues, as well as our relationship with that distributor.\nDamage to our reputation or brands could adversely affect us across businesses and regions\nOur reputation and globally recognized brands are critical to our success. Our reputation depends on a number of factors, including the quality of our offerings, the level of trust we maintain with our consumers and our ability to successfully innovate. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our others and, because some of our brands are recognized around the world, brand damage may not be locally contained. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding Paramount or its business decisions, operations, practices, content, products, social responsibility and culture, management, employees, business partners and individuals associated with the content we create and/or license, as well as our inability to adequately prepare for or respond to such negative claims or publicity, may damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, number of viewers, users and other customers, business opportunities, profitability, retention, recruiting and the trading prices of our Common Stock.\nLosses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nCertain events and circumstances, including further deterioration of market conditions, increases in interest rates, and declines in projections (including from continued weakness in the advertising market, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms, changes in consumer behavior, an acceleration in subscriber declines for our broadcast and cable networks, and/or a decrease in audience acceptance of our content), could result in a downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, intangible assets, including FCC licenses, and/or content, which could result in a noncash impairment charge. Any such impairment charge for goodwill, intangible assets and/or content could have a material adverse effect on our reported net earnings.\nOur liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe have both recognized and potential liabilities and costs related to discontinued operations and former businesses, certain of which are unrelated to our existing business, including leases, guarantees, environmental liabilities, liabilities related to the pensions and medical expenses of retirees, asbestos liabilities, contractual disputes and other pending and threatened litigation. There can be no assurance that our accruals for these matters are sufficient to cover these liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, if and/or when they become due. Therefore, there can be no assurance that these liabilities will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nESG matters could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe are committed to addressing ESG-related matters and have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals. Such initiatives, and our response to ESG-related laws and regulations, including newly-enacted domestic and international laws and regulations related to climate change and sustainability, will require additional investments, as well as the attention of our management team, in connection with implementation and oversight of new practices and reporting processes, and will impose additional compliance risk. Our ability to implement these new initiatives and achieve our goals will be dependent on a number of factors. In addition, the perceptions of our\nI-17\ninitiatives, which may vary among our viewers, customers, advertisers, distributors, suppliers, creative talent, employees, licensors and other stakeholders, the goals that we set and our efforts to achieve them may present risks to our reputation and brands. If we are unable to meet the ESG goals we set or if our initiatives and goals are not aligned with the expectations of our stakeholders, it could impact our advertising revenue, number of viewers and users and business opportunities, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Business Continuity, Cybersecurity and Privacy and Data Protection\nDisruptions or failures of, or attacks on, our or our service providers’ networks, information systems and other technologies could result in the disclosure of business or personal information, disruption of our businesses, damage to our brands and reputation, and legal exposure and financial losses\nCloud services, networks, software, information systems and other technologies we use or that are used by our third-party service providers and our product suppliers (“Providers”), including technology systems used by us and our Providers in connection with the production and distribution of our content (including content delivery networks to stream programming, films and other content in high volume to viewers and users of our online, mobile and app offerings over the internet) and that otherwise perform important functions (“Systems”), are critical to our business activities. These Systems have experienced, and are expected to continue to experience, cybersecurity attacks intended to disrupt our services and operations, exfiltrate, corrupt or prevent our access and/or use of our data, proprietary information or intellectual property, or exfiltrate or corrupt the personal and other information of third parties, employees, contractors and customers.\nShutdowns, disruptions and attacks on our or our Providers’ Systems pose increasing risks to our business and may be caused by third-party hacking; dissemination of computer viruses, worms, malware, ransomware and other destructive or disruptive software; denial-of-service attacks and other bad acts; human error; and power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Shutdowns, disruptions and attacks could have an adverse impact on us, our business partners, advertisers and other Providers, employees, consumers of our content, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data or intellectual property, and damage to equipment and data. Steps we or our Providers take to enhance, improve or upgrade Systems may not be sufficient to avoid shutdowns, disruptions and attacks. Significant events could result in a disruption of our operations and reduction of our revenues, the loss of or damage to intellectual property, the loss of or damage to the integrity of data used by management to make decisions and operate our businesses, viewer or advertiser dissatisfaction or a loss of viewers or advertisers, and damage to our reputation or brands. In addition, our recovery and business continuity plans may prove inadequate to address any such disruption, failure or cybersecurity attack.\nWe are subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of business or personal data or content maintained in our or our Providers’ Systems, including proprietary and personal information of third parties, employees and users of our online, mobile and app offerings, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to penetrate our or our Providers’ Systems, or fraudulently induce employees, business partners or users of our online, mobile and app offerings to disclose sensitive or confidential information, to gain access to our proprietary data or the data of our users, employees or contractors, our content or other intellectual property. The number and sophistication of attempted and successful phishing, information security breaches or disruptive ransomware or denial-of-service attacks have increased significantly in recent years, and because of our prominence or the prominence of our content, we and/or our Providers may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or disable, degrade or sabotage, networks and Systems change frequently, we or our Providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate security measures or remediate flaws or detect intrusion on a timely or effective basis. We also rely on proprietary and third-party technologies to optimize operations across certain areas of our business. The use of these technologies may lead to unintentional disclosure of sensitive, confidential, proprietary or personal\nI-18\ninformation of ours and of our employees or customers. Such technologies may be subject to manipulation or prone to error from data or manipulation outside our direct control.\nWe operate an information security program to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risk. Despite our efforts, the risk of unauthorized access, modification, exfiltration, destruction or denial of access with respect to our data, the data of our customers and employees or our Systems and other cybersecurity attacks cannot be eliminated entirely, and the risks associated with a potential incident remain. If a breach or perceived breach of our Systems or those of our Providers occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose consumers, revenues, advertisers and other business partners, and users of our online, mobile and app offerings; our reputation, brands, credibility and the overall attractiveness of our offerings could be damaged; and we could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair, replace or recover such Systems. We could also be subject to actions by regulatory authorities and claims asserted in private litigation. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any losses associated with such events.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nInfringement of our content reduces revenue received from the distribution of our programming, films, interactive games and other entertainment content\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights. We are fundamentally a content company and infringement of our content adversely affects the value of our content. Copyright infringement is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack effective laws and technical protection measures similar to those in the U.S. and Europe or lack effective enforcement of such measures, or both. Such foreign copyright infringement can also create a supply of pirated content for major markets. The interpretation of copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws as applied to our content, and our infringement-detection and enforcement efforts, remain in flux, and some methods of enforcement have encountered political or commercial opposition. The failure to appropriately enforce and/or the weakening of existing intellectual property laws could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect and monetize our intellectual property and thus negatively affect its value.\nCopyright infringement is made easier by the wide availability of higher bandwidth and reduced storage costs, as well as tools that undermine encryption and other security features and enable infringers to disguise their identities online. We and our production and distribution partners operate various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming and films, and intentional or unintentional acts could result in unauthorized access to our content. The continuing proliferation of digital formats and technologies heightens this risk. Internet-connected televisions, set-top boxes and mobile devices are ubiquitous, and many can support illegal retransmission platforms, illicit video-on-demand or streaming services and preloaded hardware, providing more accessible, versatile and legitimate-looking environments for consuming unlicensed film and television content. Unauthorized access to our content could result in the premature release of films, television programs or other content as well as a reduction in demand for authorized content, which would likely have adverse effects on the value of the affected content and our ability to monetize it. Additionally, laws and regulations governing new technologies, including generative AI, remain unsettled, and legal and further technological developments in this area could impact our ability to protect against infringing uses of our content.\nCopyright infringement reduces the revenue that we are able to generate from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermines lawful distribution channels, reduces the public’s and some affiliate partners’ perceived value of our content and inhibits our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such content. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, and it is likely that we will continue to expend resources in connection with these initiatives. Efforts to prevent the unauthorized reproduction, distribution and exhibition of our content may affect our profitability and may not be successful in preventing harm to our business.\nI-19\nRisks Relating to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions\nEconomic and political conditions in the U.S. and around the world could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur businesses operate and have audiences, customers and partners worldwide. Accordingly, the economic conditions in the U.S. and around the world affect a number of aspects of our businesses. The global financial markets have experienced significant recent volatility, marked by declining economic growth, diminished liquidity and availability of credit, declines in consumer confidence, significant concerns about increasing and persistently high inflation and uncertainty about economic stability. The global financial markets have also been adversely affected by current geopolitical events. There can be no assurance further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Volatility and weakness in the capital markets, the tightening of credit markets or additional decreases in our debt ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing. Increasing inflation in the U.S. raises our costs for labor and services and other costs required to operate our business.\nEconomic conditions in each market (such as current high inflation or global supply chain issues) can also impact our audience’s discretionary spending and therefore their willingness to access our content, as well as the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising from us, causing them to reduce their spending. We may also be subject to longer payment cycles. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations have impacted, and may continue to impact, revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may also be impacted by broader supply chain delays.\nOur businesses are also exposed to certain political risks inherent in conducting a global business, including retaliatory actions by governments reacting to changes in the U.S. and other countries, including in connection with trade negotiations; issues related to the presence of corruption in certain markets and enforcement of anticorruption laws and regulations; increased risk of political instability in some markets as well as conflict and sanctions preventing us from accessing those markets; escalating trade, immigration and nuclear disputes; wars, acts of terrorism or other hostilities; and other political, economic or other uncertainties.\nThese political and economic risks could create instability in any of the markets where our businesses generate revenues, which could result in a reduction of revenue or loss of investment that adversely affects our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nFailures to comply with or changes in U\n.\nS\n.\nor foreign laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we or our partners operate, including laws and regulations relating to intellectual property, content regulation, privacy, data protection, anticorruption, repatriation of profits, tax regimes, quotas, tariffs or other trade barriers, currency exchange controls, operating license and permit requirements, restrictions on foreign ownership or investment, anticompetitive conduct, export and market access restrictions.\nThe broadcast and cable industries in the U.S. are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. For example, we are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our television stations and periodically renew them. It cannot be assured that the FCC will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full terms or will not include conditions or qualifications. The nonrenewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We must also comply with extensive FCC limits on the ownership and operation of our television stations and the CBS Network in the U.S., which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some television stations.\nI-20\nOur businesses could be adversely affected by new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws by courts and regulators and the threat that additional laws or regulations may be forthcoming, as well as our ability to enforce our legal rights. Laws and regulations governing new technologies, including generative AI, remain unsettled, and legal and regulatory developments in this area could also impact our business. We could be required to change or limit certain of our business practices, which could impact our ability to generate revenues. We could also incur substantial costs to comply with new and existing laws and regulations, or face substantial fines and penalties or other liabilities, or be subjected to increased scrutiny from regulators and stakeholders, if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to complex, often inconsistent and potentially costly laws, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations relating to privacy and personal data protection\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations in the U.S. and in other countries relating to privacy and the collection, use, transfer, storage and security of personal data. In the E.U., for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) mandates data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significant fines for noncompliance, requiring extensive compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, several other regions where we do business have enacted, amended or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities. In the U.S., numerous states have passed comprehensive data privacy laws. These laws mandate a host of obligations for businesses regarding how they handle personal information and provide new and expansive rights to the residents of these states. In addition, beginning in 2023, California began to offer equivalent privacy rights in the employment and business-to-business context, similar to what exists under GDPR in the E.U. Other data privacy laws, such as health data privacy laws, may also have an impact on our business, especially with regard to some of our digital advertising offerings to advertisers in the health and wellness industries. We are also subject to laws and regulations intended specifically to protect the interests of children and the online safety and privacy of minors, such as the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and various state laws, including comprehensive privacy laws and laws specifically directed to the protection of children online. In the E.U. and the U.K., we are subject to the GDPR, and codes of conduct and rules relating to the design of digital products and services likely to be accessed by children including the U.K.’s Age Appropriate Design Code and other guidance documents issued in France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and other jurisdictions. As a result, we have been required to limit some functionality on digital properties and may be limited relative to our abilities to leverage new media with respect to children’s programming or services. Such regulations also restrict the types of advertising we are able to sell on these digital properties and how we perform measurement for advertising purposes and impose strict liability on us for certain of our actions, as well as certain actions of our advertisers and other third parties, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. Compliance with privacy and data protection rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations, which may be inconsistent with one another, and noncompliance could result in regulatory investigations and enforcement, significant monetary fines, breaches of contractual obligations and private litigation. Any actual or perceived noncompliance could also lead to harm to our reputation and market position.\nRisks Relating to Human Capital\nLabor disputes could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe and our business partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors, musicians and other creative talent, production crew members, trade employees, professional athletes and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Any labor dispute may disrupt our operations and cause production delays, which could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. In 2023, the Writers Guild of America (“WGA”) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (“SAG-AFTRA”) commenced industry-wide strikes following the expiration of their collective bargaining agreements with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (“AMPTP”), which negotiates with the guilds on behalf of content producers. These strikes resulted in months-long shutdowns in\nI-21\ntelevision and film production, and while new three-year agreements were ultimately reached with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA (expiring in May and June 2026, respectively), upcoming negotiations with other unions could lead to further work stoppages. For example, the AMPTP’s agreement with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, Its Territories and Canada (IATSE) will expire in July 2024. There can be no assurance we will be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or without work stoppages.\nThe inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur business depends on the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executives and other employees and the creative talent with whom we work. We compete for executives in highly specialized and evolving industries and our ability to attract, retain and engage such individuals may be impacted by our reputation, workplace culture, the training, development, compensation and benefits we provide, our commitment to effectively managing executive succession, and our efforts with respect to DEI and ESG matters. We also employ or contract with entertainment personalities with loyal audiences and produce films and other content with highly regarded directors, producers, writers, actors and other creative talent in highly competitive markets. These individuals are important to attracting viewers and to the success of our content, and our ability to attract and retain them may also be impacted by our reputation, culture and DEI and ESG efforts. There can be no assurance these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current appeal, or that the costs associated with retaining them or new talent will be reasonable. If we fail to retain or attract new key employees or creative talent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility in the prices of our Common Stock\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility in the prices of our Common Stock. Various factors have impacted, and may continue to impact, the prices of our Common Stock, including variations in our operating results; changes in our estimates, guidance or business plans; variations between our actual results and expectations of securities analysts, and changes in recommendations by securities analysts; changes by any ratings agency to our outlook or credit ratings; market sentiment about our business, including the viability of our streaming business and views related to its profitability; the activities, operating results or stock price of our competitors or other industry participants in the industries in which we operate; changes in management; the announcement or completion of significant transactions by us or a competitor; events affecting the stock market generally; and the broader macroeconomic and political environment in the U.S. and internationally, as well as other factors and risks described in this section. Some of these factors may adversely affect the prices of our Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nNAI, through its voting control of the Company, is in a position to control actions that require stockholder approval\nNAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of our Class A Common Stock, has voting control of the Company. As of December 31, 2023, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 77.4% of our voting Class A Common Stock, and approximately 9.7% of our Common Stock. NAI is controlled by the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Part B General Trust (the “General Trust”), which owns 80% of the voting interest of NAI. NA Administration, LLC is the corporate trustee of the General Trust and is governed by a seven-member board of directors, which acts by majority vote (subject to certain exceptions), including with respect to the NAI shares held by the General Trust. Shari E. Redstone, Chairperson, CEO and President of NAI and non-executive Chair of our Board of Directors, is one of the seven directors of NA Administration, LLC and one of two directors who are beneficiaries of the General Trust. No member of our management or other member of our Board of Directors is a director of NA Administration, LLC.\nI-22\nNAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require, or may be accomplished by, stockholder approval, including amending our bylaws, the election or removal of directors and transactions involving a change of control. For example, our bylaws provide that:\n•\nthe affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required for our stockholders to amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any of our bylaws;\n•\nany or all of our directors may be removed from office at any time prior to the expiration of his or her term of office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of outstanding shares representing at least a majority of all the aggregate voting power of outstanding shares of our Common Stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class at a special meeting of our stockholders called expressly for that purpose; and\n•\nin accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our stockholders may act by written consent without a meeting if such stockholders hold the number of shares representing not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such actions at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.\nAccordingly, our stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of any such corporate actions for so long as NAI retains voting control.\nSales of NAI’s shares of our Common Stock, some of which are pledged to lenders or otherwise encumbered, could adversely affect the stock prices\nAccording to information received from NAI, NAI has pledged to its lenders a portion of shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by NAI. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate number of shares pledged by NAI to its lenders or otherwise encumbered represented approximately 4.3% of the total outstanding shares of our Common Stock. If there is a default on NAI’s debt obligations and the lenders foreclose on the encumbered shares, the lenders may not effect a transfer, sale or disposition of any such shares of our Class A Common Stock unless NAI and its affiliates beneficially own 50% or less of our Class A Common Stock then outstanding or such shares have first been converted into our Class B Common Stock. A sale of the pledged Common Stock could adversely affect the stock prices. In addition, there can be no assurance that at some future time there will not be a change in ownership of NAI or that NAI will not sell or pledge additional shares of our Common Stock, which could adversely affect the stock prices."

Cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall strategic risk management (“SRM”) program, which evaluates key risk areas across Paramount by a cross-functional group of risk owners, in close coordination with members of senior management.\nOur information security program is overseen by our Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”) and Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), in consultation with our Chief Privacy Officer as needed. We employ a layered defense-in-depth system, which includes the use of continually evolving technologies to assess and protect the security of our enterprise-wide applications and Systems, our intellectual property and proprietary and other\nI-23\ninformation and the data and personal information of our customers and employees; monitoring of our technology environment; performing regular security audits and vulnerability assessments; and regular cybersecurity and privacy training for our employees. We engage consultants and other third parties to conduct independent security assessments of our information security program and to provide us with information on new and developing threats and tactics. We have established processes to oversee and identify risks and cybersecurity threats associated with our third-party service providers.\nPursuant to our information security and privacy policies and corresponding training, our employees and third-party vendors are instructed to notify our information security team as soon as they become aware of a suspected cybersecurity incident. We have a cybersecurity incident response plan to manage our response to potential and actual cybersecurity incidents. The plan includes procedures to assess the potential impact of an incident on the Company. When an incident meets certain criteria, the CISO and members of the information security team timely notify members of senior management, including our CTO and General Counsel, and under certain circumstances, the Audit Committee. All incidents are reviewed periodically with senior management.\nOur Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit Committee the responsibility for reviewing our processes and policies with respect to risk assessment, risk management and risk acceptance, including our processes and policies with respect to information security and cybersecurity. The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports from the CTO and CISO, which include information on the broader information security and cybersecurity threat landscape, the information security program’s strategic priorities, progress made in respect of those priorities and summaries of cybersecurity incidents and related remediation efforts. Our Chief Audit Executive reports to the Audit Committee with respect to our key risks, including information security and cybersecurity risks, which are monitored pursuant to our SRM program.\nOur CTO leads our global technology strategy and multiplatform operations and has over 15 years of experience working in technology positions at large media companies. Our CISO has more than 20 years of experience managing information security for media/entertainment, technology, retail and financial services companies. While at Paramount, our CISO oversaw the integration of Viacom’s and CBS’s information security programs and our transformation to a cloud-centric, global streaming provider.\nWe have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience attacks in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. Although past attacks have not materially impacted our strategy, financial condition or results of operations, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Business Continuity, Cybersecurity and Privacy and Data Protection.”"

Beginning with the dividend declared in the second quarter of 2023, we reduced the quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B Common Stock to $.05 per share. We currently expect to continue to pay regular cash dividends to our common stockholders.\nWe declared a quarterly cash dividend on our 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”) of $1.5493 per share during the second quarter of 2021, representing a dividend period from March 26, 2021 through July 1, 2021, and $1.4375 per share in each subsequent quarter. The final dividend is expected to be paid in the second quarter of 2024 when the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be converted into Class B Common Stock.\nAt December 31, 2023, the remaining authorization on our share repurchase program was $2.36 billion.

References in this document to “Paramount,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Paramount Global and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nSignificant components of management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition include:\n•\nOverview\n—Summary of our business and operational highlights.\n•\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n—Analysis of our results on a consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, including a comparison of 2023 to 2022.\n•\nSegment Results of Operations\n—Analysis of our results on a reportable segment basis for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, including comparisons of 2023 to 2022.\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n—Discussions of our cash flows, including sources and uses of cash, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and of our outstanding debt, commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2023.\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies\n—Detail with respect to accounting policies that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements.\n•\nLegal Matters\n—Discussion of legal matters to which we are involved.\n•\nMarket Risk\n—Discussion of how we manage exposure to market and interest rate risks.\nAn analysis of our results on a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2021, including comparisons of 2022 to 2021 and a discussion of our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, is included in “Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nII-3\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOverview\nOperational Highlights 2023 vs. 2022\nn/m - not meaningful\n(a) Certain items identified as affecting comparability are excluded in non-GAAP results. See “\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n” for details of these items and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\nFor 2023, revenues decreased 2% to $29.65 billion, as lower revenues from our linear networks, content licensing, and theatrical releases were partially offset by growth from our streaming services, led by Paramount+. The decrease in revenue from our linear networks was principally the result of continued weakness in the global advertising market and the decrease in theatrical revenues was primarily due to the comparison with the success of\nTop Gun: Maverick\nin 2022.\nWe reported an operating loss of $451 million compared with operating income of $2.34 billion for the prior year. This comparison was impacted by programming charges of $2.37 billion recorded in 2023. Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted OIBDA”), which excludes these charges as well as other items described under\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n, decreased 27% to $2.39 billion, driven by the decline in linear and licensing revenues and the timing and mix of theatrical releases in each year, partially offset by lower content costs for our linear networks and improved results for our streaming services.\nFor 2023, we reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Paramount of $1.28 billion, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared with net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount of $725 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the prior year.  The comparison was impacted by the programming charges noted above and the other items described under\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.\nThese items have been excluded in adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount and adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), which decreased $771 million and $1.19 per diluted share, respectively, primarily reflecting the lower tax-effected Adjusted OIBDA and losses from our investment in SkyShowtime.\nLabor Strikes\nIn May 2023, the Writers Guild of America (“WGA”) commenced an industry-wide strike following the expiration of its collective bargaining agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (“AMPTP”). In July 2023, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (“SAG-AFTRA”) also commenced an industry-wide strike after the expiration of its collective bargaining agreement with\nII-4\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthe AMPTP. These strikes resulted in temporary shutdowns of production on certain of our television and film programming, which resulted in less new content available for licensing and for our networks and streaming services, as well as lower-than-expected spending for content and marketing costs during the second half of 2023. We resumed production during the fourth quarter, after the AMPTP reached agreements with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nResults for each of the years presented included certain items identified as affecting comparability. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, and adjusted effective income tax rate (together, the “adjusted measures”) exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.\nBecause the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, (provision for) benefit from income taxes, net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Paramount, diluted EPS from continuing operations, and effective income tax rate, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nThe following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\n(a) See notes on the following tables for additional information on items affecting comparability.\nII-5\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a) Comprised of programming charges recorded during the first half of 2023 in connection with the integration of Showtime into Paramount+ and initiatives to rationalize and right-size our international operations to align with our streaming strategy and close or globalize certain of our international channels. These initiatives resulted in a change in strategy for certain content, which led to content being removed from our platforms or abandoned, the write-off of development costs, distribution changes, and termination of programming agreements.\n(b) Reflects a charge to reduce the carrying values of FCC licenses in five markets to their estimated fair values.\n(c) Consists of $67 million for severance costs and $35 million for the impairment of lease assets, as further described under\nRestructuring and Other Corporate Matters\n.\n(d) Reflects a net benefit for other corporate matters, including a gain of $120 million from a settlement received in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the CBS Litigation, as well as insurance recoveries relating to the Viacom Litigation (see\nLegal Matters—Stockholder Matters—Litigation Relating to the Merger\n),\nand a\n$23 million charge to increase our accrual for asbestos matters as discussed under\nLegal Matters\n—\nClaims Related to Former Businesses\n—\nAsbestos\n.\n(e) Reflects a gain recognized on our retained interest in Viacom18 following the discontinuance of equity method accounting resulting from the dilution of our interest from 49% to 13%.\n(f) Primarily reflects tax benefits from the resolution of an income tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction, guidance issued in 2023 by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) that resulted in additional foreign taxes from 2022 being eligible for a foreign tax credit, and the settlement of income tax audits, partially offset by tax expense relating to the vesting of stock-based compensation.\n(g)  The reported effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 28.8% and the adjusted effective income tax rate, which is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes of $197 million divided by adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $973 million, was 20.2%. These adjusted measures exclude the items affecting comparability described above.\nII-6\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a) Reflects a charge to reduce the carrying values of FCC licenses in two markets to their estimated fair values.\n(b) Consists of $260 million of severance charges and $68 million for the impairment of lease assets, as further described under\nRestructuring and Other Corporate Matters\n.\n(c) Includes $211 million associated with stockholder legal matters, principally relating to the merger of Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”) (the “Merger”), and $46 million recorded following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, principally to reserve against amounts due from counterparties in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.\n(d) Reflects a $41 million gain recognized upon the contribution of certain assets of Paramount+ in the Nordics to SkyShowtime as well as gains totaling $15 million from the sale of international intangible assets and a working capital adjustment to the gain from the fourth quarter 2021 sale of CBS Studio Center.\n(e) Reflects a loss on the sale of a 37.5% interest in The CW and an impairment of an investment.\n(f) Primarily reflects a deferred tax benefit resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations.\n(g) The reported effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 17.9% and the adjusted effective income tax rate, which is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes of $466 million divided by adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $1.95 billion, was 23.9%. These adjusted measures exclude the items affecting comparability described above.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - 2023 vs. 2022\nRevenues\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues are generated primarily from the sale of advertising spots on our global broadcast and cable networks, television stations, and streaming services. For 2023, advertising revenues decreased 8%, driven by a decline in linear advertising reflecting continued weakness in the global advertising market and lower political\nII-7\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nadvertising revenues, partially offset by higher advertising revenues for our streaming services. In addition, foreign exchange rate changes negatively impacted the total advertising revenue comparison by 1 percentage point.\nAffiliate and Subscription\nAffiliate and subscription revenues are principally comprised of affiliate fees received from distributors for carriage of our cable networks (cable affiliate fees) and owned television stations (retransmission fees), fees received from television stations for their affiliation with the CBS Television Network (reverse compensation), and subscription fees for our streaming services.\nFor 2023, affiliate and subscription revenues increased 13%, primarily driven by growth in subscribers for Paramount+ to 67.5 million at December 31, 2023 from 55.9 million at December 31, 2022, as well as higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. The increase was partially offset by lower affiliate fees for our linear networks.\nTheatrical\nTheatrical revenues are principally earned from the worldwide theatrical distribution of films through audience ticket sales. For 2023, theatrical revenues decreased 34%, reflecting the comparison against the strong performance of\nTop Gun: Maverick\nin 2022.\nLicensing and Other\nLicensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced or distributed for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include revenues from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) and electronic sell-through services and the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and revenues from studio rentals and production services.\nThe 10% decrease in licensing and other revenues was driven by the timing and mix of content available for licensing, including the comparison against the success of\nTop Gun: Maverick\nand the licensing of\nHalloween Ends\nin 2022. In addition, content available for licensing in the second half of 2023, as well as studio rentals and production services, were negatively impacted by temporary production shutdowns as a result of labor strikes.\nII-8\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOperating Expenses\nContent Costs\nContent costs include the amortization of costs of internally-produced television and theatrical film content; amortization of acquired program rights; other television production costs, including on-air talent; and participation and residuals expenses, which reflect amounts owed to talent and other participants in our content pursuant to contractual and collective bargaining arrangements.\nFor 2023, content costs decreased 1%, primarily driven by lower costs associated with licensing revenues and television content, including from the impact of production shutdowns, which reduced the content available for licensing and exhibition on our networks and streaming services. The decrease in content costs also reflects lower costs associated with theatrical releases and savings following the changes in strategy for certain content discussed under\nProgramming Charges\n. These decreases were partially offset by increased investment in our streaming services and costs associated with pay-per-view boxing events. In addition, 2023 includes costs incurred to retain our production capabilities for certain of the delayed television and film productions, expenses for excess production overhead, and incremental costs incurred to resume film production, which totaled $131 million.\nDistribution and Other\nDistribution and other operating expenses primarily include costs relating to the distribution of our content, including print and advertising for theatrical releases and costs for third-party distribution; compensation; revenue-sharing costs to television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and other ancillary and overhead costs associated with our operations.\nFor 2023, distribution and other operating expenses increased 10%, primarily reflecting higher costs associated with the growth of our streaming services, including costs for third-party distribution and compensation, and higher costs associated with theatrical releases.\nProgramming Charges\nDuring 2023, in connection with the integration of Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms, we performed a comprehensive strategic review of the combined content portfolio of Showtime and Paramount+. Additionally, we commenced a review of our international content portfolio in connection with initiatives to rationalize and right-size our international operations to align with our streaming strategy, and close or globalize certain of our international channels. As a result, we changed the strategy for certain content, which led to content being removed from our platforms or abandoned, the write-off of development costs, distribution changes, and termination of programming agreements. Accordingly, we recorded programming charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations relating to these actions during the first half of 2023. These charges, which totaled $2.37 billion, were comprised of $1.97 billion for the impairment of content to its estimated fair value, as well as $402 million for development cost write-offs and contract termination costs.\nII-9\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nIn connection with our continued review of our international content strategy, during the first quarter of 2024 we made a strategic decision to focus on content with mass global appeal. As part of this, we are rationalizing original content on Paramount+, especially internationally, and improving the efficiency of our linear network programming. As a result, we have reviewed our expansive global content portfolio and are removing select content from our platforms. In addition, we have decided not to move forward with certain titles and therefore are abandoning some development projects and terminating certain programming agreements. Accordingly, we expect to recognize additional programming charges that we currently expect to be in the range of approximately $700 million to $900 million during the first quarter of 2024. As we continue to evaluate our content portfolio, we may incur additional programming charges later in 2024.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs incurred for advertising, marketing, occupancy, professional service fees, and back office support, including employee compensation and technology. The 3% increase in SG&A expenses in 2023 was driven by higher costs to support the growth of our streaming services, including employee and marketing costs, as well as higher incentive compensation and technology costs. The higher marketing costs for our DTC services were largely offset by lower marketing costs for our linear networks.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense reflects depreciation of fixed assets, including equipment under finance leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense reflects increased depreciation for software related to the unification and evolution of our systems and platforms.\nImpairment Charges\nFor 2023 and 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $83 million and $27 million, respectively, in the\nTV Media\nsegment to write down the carrying values of certain of our FCC licenses to their estimated fair values (see\nCritical Accounting Policies\n—\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Tests\n—\nFCC Licenses\n).\nII-10\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRestructuring and Other Corporate Matters\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded the following restructuring charges and other corporate matters.\n(a) Severance costs include the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation.\nRestructuring Charges\nSince the Merger, we implemented a series of initiatives designed to integrate and transform our operations, including changes in management structure. These initiatives led to restructuring actions, and as a result, we recorded restructuring charges for severance of $67 million and $260 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The actions that gave rise to the severance costs included our 2022 operating segment realignment, the integration of Showtime into Paramount+, and the restructuring of our international operations. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2023, certain eligible employees voluntarily elected to participate in a plan under which they will receive one-time severance benefits, resulting in $13 million of severance costs.\nWe currently expect to incur additional restructuring charges for severance in the range of approximately $100 million to $200 million during the first quarter of 2024 associated with strategic changes in our global workforce.\nIn the years following the Merger, we also consolidated our real estate portfolio to reduce our real estate footprint and create cost synergies. In connection with this consolidation, we identified lease assets that we determined we would not use and instead sublease or terminate early, which resulted in lease impairment charges of $35 million and $68 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther Corporate Matters\nIn 2023, we recorded a net benefit of $133 million in other corporate matters, principally consisting of a gain of $120 million from a settlement received in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the final dismissal of the CBS Litigation, as well as insurance recoveries relating to the Viacom Litigation (each as defined and further described under\nLegal Matters\n—\nStockholder Matters\n—\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\n). These benefits are partially offset by a charge of $23 million to increase our accrual for asbestos matters as discussed under\nLegal Matters\n—\nClaims Related to Former Businesses—Asbestos.\nIn 2022, we recorded charges for other corporate matters of $257 million, consisting of $211 million associated with stockholder legal matters, principally relating to the Merger\n,\nincluding a charge for the settlement of $122.5 million in connection with the final dismissal of the Viacom Litigation. The charges also included $46 million recorded following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, principally to reserve against amounts due from counterparties in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.\nGains on Dispositions\nDuring 2022, we recorded a gain of $41 million relating to the contribution of certain assets of Paramount+ in the Nordics to SkyShowtime. Also in 2022, we recorded gains totaling $15 million, comprised of a gain from the sale\nII-11\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nof international intangible assets and a working capital adjustment to the gain from the fourth quarter 2021 sale of CBS Studio Center.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nThe following table presents our outstanding debt balances, excluding finance leases, and the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nGain (Loss) from Investments\nn/m - not meaningful\nDuring 2023, we recorded a gain of $168 million on our retained interest in Viacom18 following the discontinuance of equity method accounting resulting from the dilution of our interest from 49% to 13%. The loss from investments for 2022 includes a loss of $4 million on the sale of a 37.5% interest in The CW, which was principally comprised of transaction costs, and a $5 million impairment of an investment.\nGain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $29 million associated with the early repurchase of long-term debt of $1.04 billion. For 2022, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $120 million associated with the early redemption of long-term debt of $2.91 billion.\nII-12\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOther Items, Net\nThe following table presents the components of “Other items, net.”\n(a) For 2023, the increase in pension and postretirement benefit costs is the result of higher interest cost and a decrease in the expected return on plan assets.\nProvision for/Benefit from Income Taxes\nThe provision for/benefit from income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For 2023, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of $361 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 28.8%. The tax benefit for 2023 was primarily the result of a benefit of $582 million on programming charges of $2.37 billion. Our adjusted effective income tax rate, which excludes the impacts from these programming charges, as well as the other items impacting comparability described under\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n, was 20.2%.\nFor 2022, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $227 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 17.9%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate, which excludes the items impacting comparability described under\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n, was 23.9%\nEquity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax\nThe following table presents equity in loss of investee companies for our equity-method investments.\nFor 2023, the higher loss for our equity-method investments was driven by SkyShowtime, which launched its streaming service in September 2022, and a $16 million impairment of an international joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nNet Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Paramount and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations\nn/m - not meaningful\nII-13\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFor 2023, we recorded a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Paramount of $1.28 billion, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared with net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount of $725 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the decline in tax-effected operating income, including the impact from the programming charges discussed above.\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations\nThe following tables set forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which primarily reflects the results of Simon & Schuster prior to its sale on October 30, 2023 for $1.62 billion. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $695 million during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n(a) Primarily relates to indemnification obligations for leases associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc.\n(b)  In accordance with the terms of a previous agreement to sell Simon & Schuster, we received a $200 million termination payment after the United States (“U.S.”) Department of Justice prevailed in its suit to block the sale.\nII-14\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSegments\nWe are a global media, streaming and entertainment company that creates premium content and experiences for audiences worldwide, and are comprised of the following segments:\n•\nTV Media—\nOur\nTV Media\nsegment consists of our (1) broadcast operations\n—\nthe CBS Television Network, our domestic broadcast television network; CBS Stations, our owned television stations; and our international free-to-air networks, Network 10, Channel 5, Telefe, and Chilevisión; (2) domestic premium and basic cable networks, including Paramount+ with Showtime (w\ne rebranded Showtime as Paramount+ with Showtime in January 2024\n), MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, The Smithsonian Channel, Nickelodeon, BET Media Group, CBS Sports Network, and international extensions of certain of these brands; and (3) domestic and international television studio operations, including CBS Studios, Paramount Television Studios and Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios, as well as CBS Media Ventures, which produces and distributes first-run syndicated programming.\nTV Media\nalso includes a number of digital properties such as CBS News Streaming and CBS Sports HQ\n.\n•\nDirect-to-Consumer\n—\nOur\nDirect-to-Consumer\nsegment includes our portfolio of domestic and international\npay and free streaming services, including Paramount+, Pluto TV, BET+ and Noggin. Effective June 27, 2023, we launched the Paramount+ with Showtime subscription plan in the United States. Effective July 6, 2023, Showtime Networks’ domestic premium subscription service was no longer offered as a standalone subscription service for new subscribers.\n•\nFilmed Entertainment\n—\nOur\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment\nconsists of Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation, Nickelodeon Studio, Awesomeness and Miramax\n.\nWe present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, other corporate matters, programming charges, impairment charges and gains or losses on dispositions, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance for segment reporting since it is the primary method used by our management. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management. Stock-based compensation is included as a component of our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. See\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nfor a reconciliation of total Adjusted OIBDA to Operating Income, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP.\nSegment Results of Operations - 2023 vs. 2022\nII-15\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nn/m - not meaningful\n(a) For 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation expense of $5 million and $14 million, respectively, is included in “Restructuring and other corporate matters”.\nTV Media\nRevenues\nFor 2023, revenues decreased\n8%, driven by lower advertising revenues, primarily due to continued weakness in the global advertising market, and lower licensing revenues.\nAdvertising\nThe 12%\ndecrease in advertising revenues was primarily the result of continued weakness in the global advertising market. Domestic advertising revenues declined 12% to $7.04 billion and international advertising revenues decreased 18% to $1.15 billion. The domestic decline also reflects lower political advertising revenues as a result of U.S. midterm elections in 2022. Foreign exchange rate changes negatively impacted the total advertising revenue comparison by 1 percentage point.\nII-16\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAffiliate and Subscription\nAffiliate and subscription revenues decreased 1%. Domestic affiliate and subscription revenues decreased slightly to $7.66 billion, reflecting declines in affiliate fees, which were offset by higher subscription revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. The decrease in domestic affiliate fees reflects linear subscriber declines, which were largely offset by contractual pricing increases. Declines in domestic linear subscribers are expected to continue in 2024. International affiliate and subscription revenues decreased 12% to $422 million, driven by a shift of revenue from our pay television services to our streaming services following the restructuring of certain affiliate agreements.\nLicensing and Other\nLicensing and other revenues decreased 9%, reflecting a lower volume of licensing in the secondary market as well as lower revenues from content produced for third parties. Content available for licensing in the second half of the year was impacted by temporary production shutdowns as a result of labor strikes.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA decreased 12%, primarily driven by the decline in revenues, partially offset by lower costs, principally for content and marketing, including from the impact of labor strikes.\nDirect-to-Consumer\n(a) Subscribers include customers with access to Paramount+, either directly through our owned and operated apps and websites, or through third-party distributors. Our subscribers include paid subscriptions and those customers registered in a free trial. For the periods above, subscriber counts reflect the number of subscribers as of the applicable period-end date.\nRevenues\nFor 2023, revenues increased 37%, driven primarily by growth from Paramount+.\nAdvertising\nThe 17% increase in advertising revenues was driven by an increase in impressions for Paramount+ and growth from Pluto TV, including from international launches.\nII-17\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSubscription\nThe 46% increase in subscription revenues was primarily driven by increases in both domestic and international Paramount+ subscribers, with total growth of 11.6 million, or 21%, compared with December 31, 2022. The revenue growth also includes the impact of domestic pricing increases for each of our subscription plans that went into effect when we launched the Paramount+ with Showtime plan on June 27, 2023, as well as revenues from pay-per-view boxing events.\nDuring the fourth quarter, global Paramount+ subscribers increased 4.1 million, or 6%, to 67.5 million, compared with 63.4 million at September 30, 2023. The growth reflects the benefit from the NFL season and premieres of\nGood Burger 2\nand\nLawmen: Bass Reeves\n, and growth from international markets\n.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA improved by $156 million, as revenue growth more than offset higher costs to support growth in our streaming services, including content, distribution, marketing and employee costs.\nFilmed Entertainment\nn/m - not meaningful\n(a) Primarily reflects advertising revenues earned from the use of\nFilmed Entertainment\ncontent on third party digital platforms as well as sponsorships.\nRevenues\nThe 20% decrease in revenues primarily reflects lower theatrical and licensing revenues, driven by the success of\nTop Gun: Maverick\nin 2022.\nTheatrical\nThe 34% decrease in theatrical revenues primarily reflects a difficult comparison against the prior year as a result of the strong performance of\nTop Gun: Maverick.\nTheatrical releases that benefited 2023 results include\nMission: Impossible\n—\nDead Reckoning Part One, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\nand\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.\nLicensing and Other\nLicensing and other revenues decreased 14%, principally reflecting lower licensing of recent theatrical releases in 2023 compared with 2022, driven by the success of\nTop Gun: Maverick\nin the home entertainment market, and the licensing of\nHalloween Ends\nin 2022. The decrease also reflects lower revenues from studio rentals and production services as a result of labor strikes.\nII-18\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA decreased $391 million, primarily reflecting the mix of theatrical releases in each year, including the success of\nTop Gun: Maverick\nin the prior year, lower profits from licensing, incremental costs incurred during production shutdowns and lower revenues from studio rentals and production services.\nFluctuations in results for the\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment may occur as a result of the timing of the recognition of distribution costs, including print and advertising, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, while the revenues for the respective film are recognized as earned through the film’s theatrical exhibition and distribution to other platforms.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows expected to be generated and available to meet these needs. Our operating needs include, among other items, expenditures for content for our broadcast and cable networks and streaming services, including television and film programming, sports rights, and talent contracts, as well as advertising and marketing costs to promote our content and platforms; payments for leases, interest, and income taxes; and pension funding obligations. Certain of our cash requirements discussed above are associated with long-term contractual commitments (see notes 10 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements).\nOur investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures; acquisitions; funding relating to new and existing investments, including SkyShowtime, our streaming joint venture with Comcast Corporation, under which both parent companies have committed to support initial operations over a multiyear period; discretionary share repurchases; dividends; and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. Our long-term debt obligations due over the next five years were $2.14 billion as of December 31, 2023 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements\n)\n. We routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to manage our outstanding debt maturities, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.\nFunding for both our short-term and long-term operating, investing and financing needs will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents (which were $2.46 billion as of December 31, 2023), and our ability to refinance our debt. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the borrowing capacity under our $3.50 billion Credit Facility described below is sufficient to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. In addition, if necessary, we can increase our liquidity position by reducing non-committed spending.\nOur access to capital markets and the cost of any new borrowings can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic and market conditions, as well as by ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.\nII-19\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCash Flows\nThe changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:\nOperating Activities.\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations for 2023 was a net source of cash of $384 million compared to a net use of cash of $142 million for 2022. The increase in operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily reflects lower spending for content in 2023, including the impact from production shutdowns, partially offset by higher spending for other expenses, including from the timing of payments.\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities includes payments of $203 million and $244 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, associated with restructuring, merger-related costs and transformation initiatives, net of insurance recoveries and settlements received related to merger-related litigation matters. Since the Merger, we have invested in a number of transformation initiatives. Initially, these were undertaken to realize synergies related to the Merger. More recently, our transformation initiatives are related to future-state technology, including the unification and evolution of systems and platforms, and migration to the cloud. In addition, we are investing in future-state workspaces, including adapting our facilities to accommodate our hybrid and agile work model.\nCash flow provided by operating activities from discontinued operations reflects the operating activities of Simon & Schuster before it was sold in October 2023, and for 2022 also included the receipt of the $200 million termination fee described under\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations\n.\nII-20\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nInvesting Activities\n(a) Includes payments associated with the implementation of our transformation initiatives of $30 million and $45 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(b) 2023 primarily reflects the collection of receivables associated with the sale of a 37.5% interest in The CW in the prior year and proceeds received from the disposition of certain channels in Latin America. 2022 primarily reflects proceeds related to the sale of investments and from the disposition of international intangible assets.\n(c) 2023 includes the proceeds received from the sale of Simon & Schuster.\nFinancing Activities\nDividends\nThe following table presents dividends declared per share and total dividends for our Class A and Class B Common Stock and our 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”) for 2023 and 2022. Beginning with the dividend declared in the second quarter of 2023, we reduced the quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B Common Stock to $.05 per share (or $.20 annually).\nII-21\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCapital Structure\nThe following table sets forth our debt.\n(a)    At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the senior and junior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $419 million and $442 million, respectively, and (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of $81 million and $89 million, respectively. The face value of our total debt was $15.10 billion at December 31, 2023 and $16.38 billion at December 31, 2022.\nSenior Debt\nAt December 31, 2023, our senior debt was comprised of senior notes and debentures due between 2025 and 2050 with interest rates ranging from 2.90% to 7.875%.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased $1.04 billion of our outstanding senior notes due between 2025 and 2027 through a tender offer, for an aggregate repurchase price of $1.00 billion. These repurchases resulted in a pre-tax gain on extinguishment of debt of $29 million. In 2023, we also repaid our $139 million of 7.875% debentures and $35 million of 7.125% senior notes, each at maturity.\nIn 2022, we redeemed senior notes totaling $2.39 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.49 billion and redeemed, at par, our $520 million of 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057. These redemptions resulted in a total pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $120 million.\nOur outstanding senior notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for $9.67 billion of the senior notes and debentures that requires us to make a redemption offer at 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of ratings downgrades to below investment grade by all three ratings agencies (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Ltd.) due to a change of control.\nJunior Debt\nIn 2022, we issued $1.00 billion of 6.375% junior subordinated debentures due 2062. The interest rate on these debentures will reset on March 30, 2027, and every five years thereafter to a fixed rate equal to the 5-year Treasury Rate (as defined pursuant to the terms of the debentures) plus a spread of 3.999% from March 30, 2027, 4.249% from March 30, 2032 and 4.999% from March 30, 2047. These debentures can be called by us at par plus a make whole premium any time before March 30, 2027, or at par on March 30, 2027 or on any interest payment date thereafter.\nOur $643 million of 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rate until February 28, 2027, on which date the rate will switch to a floating rate. Under the terms of the debentures the floating rate is based on three-month LIBOR plus 3.899%, reset quarterly, however, with the phasing out of LIBOR and the passage of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, signed into law on March 15,\nII-22\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2022, it is expected that the 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due 2057 will, upon switching to a floating rate, bear interest at a replacement rate based on three-month CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). These debentures can be called by us at par at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period.\nOur junior subordinated debentures also provide for certain covenant packages. In the event of ratings downgrades by all three rating agencies due to a change of control, there is a provision in the junior subordinated debentures that requires us to either elect to redeem the debentures at 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or, if we elect not to redeem the debentures, the interest rate will be increased by 5 percentage points.\nThe subordination and extended term, as well as an interest deferral option of the junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings Inc., and a 25% equity credit by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\nCommercial Paper\nAt both December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.\nCredit Facility\nDuring 2023, we amended and extended our $3.50 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), which now matures in January 2027 (the “2023 Amendment”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered into. Under the 2023 Amendment, we replaced LIBOR as the benchmark rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars with Term SOFR. The benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR, respectively. The Credit Facility also includes a provision that the occurrence of a change of control of Paramount will be an event of default that would give the lenders the right to accelerate any outstanding loans and terminate their commitments. At December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the availability under the Credit Facility was $3.50 billion.\nThe Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant which sets a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (“Leverage Ratio”) at the end of each quarter, which prior to the 2023 Amendment was 4.5x. Under the 2023 Amendment, the maximum Leverage Ratio was increased to 5.75x for each quarter through and including the quarter ending September 30, 2024, and will then decrease to 5.5x for the quarters ending December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, with decreases of 0.25x for each subsequent quarter until it reaches 4.5x for the quarter ending March 31, 2026. The Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. Under the 2023 Amendment, the definition of the Leverage Ratio was also modified to set the maximum amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that can be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness to $1.50 billion for quarters ending on or after September 30, 2024. In addition, under the 2023 Amendment, Simon & Schuster was treated as a continuing operation for the purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA until its disposition in October 2023. We met the covenant as of December 31, 2023.\nII-23\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOther Bank Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding bank borrowings under Miramax’s $50 million credit facility, which matures in November 2024. This facility replaced the previous $300 million credit facility that matured in April 2023. At December 31, 2022, we had $55 million of bank borrowings under the previous facility with a weighted average interest rate of 7.09%.\nLetters of Credit and Surety Bonds\nAt December 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $213 million that were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as a $1.9 billion standby letter of credit facility, under which no letters of credit were issued. In January 2024, in accordance with the contractual requirements of one of our commitments, a $1.9 billion letter of credit was issued under this facility. The amount outstanding under the letter of credit will decrease throughout 2024 as we make payments under the related contractual commitment. Letters of credit and surety bonds are primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business under contractual requirements of certain of our commitments. The standby letter of credit facility, which matures in May 2026, is subject to the same principal financial covenant as the Credit Facility.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Significant judgments used in the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition include the identification of distinct performance obligations in contracts containing bundled advertising sales or bundled content licenses, and the allocation of consideration among individual performance obligations within these arrangements based on their relative standalone selling prices.\nAdvertising Revenues\n—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or streamed or displayed on digital platforms. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the\nII-24\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\naudience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.\nAffiliate Revenues\n—The performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with certain distributors, also includes a license to programming for video-on-demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to\nour customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming.\nContent Licensing Revenues\n—For licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film, which is based on licenses for comparable content within the marketplace. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues.\nFilm and Television Production and Programming Costs\nCosts incurred to produce television programs and feature films are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film. The costs incurred to acquire television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. Acquired programming rights, including rights for sports programming, are expensed over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.\nWe categorize our capitalized production and programming costs based on the expected predominant monetization strategy throughout the life of the content.  Our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized through licensing and distribution on third-party platforms is considered individually monetized and our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized on our networks and streaming services together with other programming is considered to be monetized as part of a film group. The predominant monetization strategy is determined when capitalization of production costs commences and is reassessed if there is a significant change to the expected future monetization strategy. This reassessment will include an assessment of the monetization strategy throughout the entire life of the programming.\nFor internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. Management’s judgment is required in estimating Ultimate Revenues and the costs to be incurred\nII-25\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthroughout the life of each television program or feature film. These estimates are used to determine the timing of amortization of capitalized production costs and expensing of participation and residual costs.\nFor television programming, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within 10 years from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.\nFor feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. For films intended for theatrical release, we believe the performance during the theatrical exhibition is the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. We also review and revise estimates of Ultimate Revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information.\nFor acquired film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition.\nFor programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. Such estimates require management’s judgment and include consideration of factors such as expected revenues to be derived from the programming, the expected number of future airings, and, for acquired programming, the length of the license period. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues, an accelerated method of amortization is used. These estimates are periodically reviewed and updated based on information available throughout the contractual term or life of each program.\nFor content that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis, a television program or feature film is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. If the result of the impairment test indicates that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded for the amount of the difference. Content that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and would similarly be tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the film group is less than its unamortized costs. A change in the monetization strategy of content, whether monetized individually or as part of a film group, will result in a reassessment of the predominant monetization strategy and may trigger an assessment of the content for impairment. Any resulting impairment test will be performed either at the individual level or at the film group level where the future cash flows will be generated. In addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that has been abandoned are written off.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Tests\nWe perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses, annually during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event\nII-26\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\noccurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.\nFCC Licenses\n—FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2023, we had 14 television markets with FCC license book values, which totaled $2.31 billion.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each television market that we estimate has an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that significantly exceeds its respective carrying value. For the 2023 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for six of our television markets. For each market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as average market share. We also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test on these markets was unnecessary.\nWe performed a quantitative impairment test for the FCC licenses in the remaining eight markets. The quantitative impairment test of FCC licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections. The discount rate and the long-term growth rate were 9% and 1%, respectively.\nThe impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in five of the markets were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $83 million to write down the carrying values of these FCC licenses to their aggregate estimated fair value of $887 million. The impairment charge, which is recorded within the\nTV Media\nsegment, was primarily due to increased market volatility and higher interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior quarters of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, which resulted in a higher discount rate. The estimated fair values of FCC licenses in the three remaining markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of $357 million, were each within 10% of their respective carrying values. For the eight markets tested, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $1.24 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points, or a decrease to the long-term growth rate of 50 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the aggregate fair value of FCC licenses to fall below the aggregate carrying value by $97 million and $72 million, respectively.\nThe estimated fair values of FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which we own and operate television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including continued market volatility and increases in interest rates, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to our current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size.\nII-27\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nA further downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in an additional impairment and a noncash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nGoodwill\n—Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. As of December 31, 2023, we had five reporting units in three reportable segments,\nTV Media\n($11.17 billion of goodwill),\nDirect-to-Consumer\n($2.73 billion of goodwill) and\nFilmed Entertainment\n($2.62 billion of goodwill). The\nTV Media\nsegment is comprised of two reporting units with $5.16 billion of goodwill in one reporting unit and $6.01 billion in the other.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that we estimate has a fair value that substantially exceeds its respective carrying value. Additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed, which was in the fourth quarter of 2021 for one reporting unit and as of January 1, 2022 for all other reporting units (“Prior Quantitative Tests”), as described below. For the 2023 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all reporting units. For each reporting unit, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included actual and expected financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, we considered growth projections from independent sources, significant developments within the industry, and market factors, including changes in our market capitalization. Our assessment indicated that macroeconomic factors have negatively impacted inputs used in our previous quantitative tests, including discount rates, certain industry growth rates, and revenue and earnings multiples of publicly traded companies with operations and economic characteristics comparable to each of our reporting units (“comparable company trading multiples”). We assessed the extent of the impact of the changes in these inputs in relation to the significant headroom for each reporting unit in our previous quantitative tests. Based on this assessment, we concluded that while there are indicators that the fair value of most of our reporting units have declined, it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continues to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts. Therefore, performing quantitative impairment tests was unnecessary.\nFor the 2022 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all reporting units.\nCertain future events and circumstances, including further deterioration of market conditions, increases in interest rates, and declines in projections, including from continued weakness in the advertising market, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms, changes in consumer behavior, an acceleration in subscriber declines for our broadcast and cable networks, and/or a decrease in audience acceptance of our content and platforms could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the goodwill impairment tests. A significant adverse change in these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, while we believe our valuation methodologies are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units, the application of different valuation techniques to our reporting units, either individually or in combination, could result in a different fair value.\nPrior Quantitative Tests\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative test for one reporting unit. In the first quarter of 2022, in connection with changes to our management structure and the resulting change in operating segments, we reassessed our reporting units and reallocated goodwill from the four reporting units in place prior to the realignment to six reporting units, using a relative fair value approach. We performed goodwill impairment tests\nII-28\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nas of January 1, 2022 on the reporting units in place before and after the change. For these impairment tests, we performed quantitative tests for three of the reporting units that existed prior to the change and five of the reporting units in place subsequent to the change. For a quantitative goodwill impairment test we calculate an estimated fair value to determine whether it exceeds the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. We also consider the reasonableness of the market capitalization of our Company in relation to the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units. For one of the quantitative tests, we estimated fair value based on the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses, and for the remaining quantitative tests, we estimated the fair value based on both the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses. The Discounted Cash Flow Method requires us to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows, including growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for a projection period, plus the terminal value of the business at the end of the projection period. The assumptions about future cash flows are based on our internal forecasts of the reporting unit, which incorporates our long-term business plans and historical trends. The terminal value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on historical and projected inflation and economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. A discount rate is determined for the reporting unit based on the risks of achieving the future cash flows, including risks applicable to the industry and market as a whole, as well as the capital structure of comparable entities. We utilized discount rates ranging from 9% to 13.5% and terminal values that were based on either growth rates ranging from 1% to 2% or revenue multiples ranging from 1.5x to 2.7x. Traded and transaction values were determined using comparable company trading multiples as well as revenue and earnings multiples from recent transactions of comparable companies. The selected multiples consider each reporting unit’s relative growth, profitability, size, and risk relative to the selected publicly traded companies. Based on the results of these impairment tests, we concluded that the estimated fair values of the reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, no impairment charge was required.\nFor one of the reporting units, we performed a qualitative assessment before and after the reporting unit change and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was higher than its carrying amount.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of a management reorganization, the reporting units within our\nTV Media\nsegment changed from three to two reporting units.\nLegal Matters\nEstimates of liabilities related to legal issues and predecessor operations, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is difficult to predict long-term future asbestos liabilities as events and circumstances may impact the estimate. The reasonably estimable period for our long-term asbestos liability is 10 years, which we determined in consultation with a third-party firm with expertise in estimating asbestos liability and is due to the inherent uncertainties in the tort litigation system. Our estimated asbestos liability is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, and is assessed in consultation with the third\n-\nparty firm. Based on an assessment of these factors, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the accrual for asbestos matters by $23 million, which was recorded as a charge in “Restructuring and other corporate matters” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The increased accrual was primarily the result of a lower-than-expected rate of decline in new claims. Changes in circumstances in future periods could cause our actual liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental matters to be higher or lower than our current accrual. We will continue to evaluate our estimates and update our accruals as needed.\nII-29\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nPensions\nPension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the accumulated benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2023, changes in actuarial assumptions resulted in an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss compared with the prior year-end due to a decrease in the discount rate, which was largely offset by the favorable performance of pension plan assets. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $79 million and would have an insignificant impact on 2024 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $6 million to 2024 pension expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions.  When recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. While valuation allowances can require significant judgment, we believe the valuation allowance of $498 million at December 31, 2023 properly reduces our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nA number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors, including, changes in tax laws and interpretations, information received from tax authorities, and other changes in facts and circumstances. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that the reserve for uncertain tax positions of $286 million at December 31, 2023 is properly recorded.\nII-30\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nLegal Matters\nGeneral\nOn an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “Litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStockholder Matters\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nBeginning in February 2020, three purported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Chancery Court”). In March 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated the three lawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating Engineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action captioned\nIn re CBS Corporation Stockholder Class Action and Derivative Litigation\n(the “CBS Litigation”). In April 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, National Amusements, Inc., Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, additional members of the CBS Board of Directors (including Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and the Company as nominal defendant. The Complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the negotiation and approval of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 13, 2019, between CBS and Viacom (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleged waste and unjust enrichment in connection with certain aspects of Mr. Ianniello’s compensation awards. The Complaint sought unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In December 2022, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the fiduciary duty claim against Mr. Klieger.\nIn May 2023, the parties to the CBS Litigation entered into a settlement agreement that provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the CBS Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment to the Company in the amount of $167.5 million, less administrative costs and plaintiffs’ counsels’ fees and expenses. In September 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court approved the settlement and dismissed the CBS Litigation with prejudice. In October 2023, the Company received the settlement payment in the amount of $120 million, which reflects the settlement of $167.5 million after a deduction was made for administrative costs and plaintiffs’ counsels’ fees and expenses, and accordingly, we recognized a gain of $120 million during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nBeginning in November 2019, four purported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Delaware Chancery Court. In January 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated the four lawsuits. In February 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. Subsequently, in February 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish (as used in this paragraph, the “Viacom Litigation”). The Complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom\nII-31\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nstockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint sought unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In December 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed. In March 2023, the parties to the Viacom Litigation entered into a settlement agreement that provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the Viacom Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment in the amount of $122.5 million, which has been fully paid. In July 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court granted approval of the settlement and dismissed the Viacom Litigation with prejudice.\nLitigation Related to Stock Offerings\nIn August 2021, Camelot Event Driven Fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, and in November 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”). The Complaint is on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was filed against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company’s stock price. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were heard in January 2023. In February 2023, the Court dismissed all claims against the Company while allowing the claims against the underwriters to proceed. The plaintiffs and underwriter defendants have appealed the ruling.\nLitigation Related to Television Station Owner\ns\nIn September 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning about January 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among fourteen total defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. We reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, was subject to Court approval. In August 2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement, and in December 2023, the Court granted final approval of the settlement.\nClaims Related to Former Businesses\nAsbestos\nWe are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.\nII-32\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nClaims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2023, we had pending approximately 19,970 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 21,580 as of December 31, 2022 and 27,770 as of December 31, 2021. During 2023, we received approximately 2,790 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 4,400 claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2023 and 2022 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $54 million and $57 million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.\nFilings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. A significant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict long-term future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The reasonably estimable period for our long-term asbestos liability is 10 years, which we determined in consultation with a third-party firm with expertise in estimating asbestos liability and is due to the inherent uncertainties in the tort litigation system. Our estimated asbestos liability is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, and is assessed in consultation with the third-party firm. Based on an assessment of these factors during the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the accrual for asbestos matters by $23 million, which was recorded as a charge in “Restructuring and other corporate matters” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The increased accrual was primarily the result of a lower-than-expected rate of decline in new claims. Changes in circumstances in future periods could cause our actual liabilities to be higher or lower than our current accrual. We will continue to evaluate our estimates and update our accrual as needed.\nOther\nFrom time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods and, as a result, our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nII-33\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British pound, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, including future production costs and programming obligations, as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $2.72 billion and $3.06 billion, respectively. For 2023, $2.20 billion related to future production costs and $523 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2022, $2.40 billion related to future production costs and $655 million\nrelated to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.\nInterest Risk\nInterest rates on future long-term debt issuances are exposed to risk related to movements in long-term interest rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify this exposure at our discretion. There were no interest rate hedges outstanding at December 31, 2023 or 2022 but in the future we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $14.60 billion and the fair value was $13.6 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes and debentures by approximately $1.49 billion and $665 million, respectively.\nCredit Risk\nWe continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\nOur receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2023 or 2022, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.\nII-34\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRelated Parties\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements."

Paramount Global and its subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework set forth in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nII-37\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Paramount Global\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Paramount Global and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nII-38\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAmortization of Certain Internally-Produced Television Programming Costs\nAs described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized through licensing and distribution on third-party platforms is considered individually monetized and programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized on the Company’s networks and streaming services together with other programming, is considered to be monetized as part of a film group. The Company’s amortization of internally-produced television and film programming costs with individual monetization and film group monetization was $7.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, a majority of which is attributable to the amortization of certain internally-produced television programming costs. For internally-produced television programs that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, management uses an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. For internally-produced television programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, capitalized costs are amortized based on management’s estimate of the timing of the Company’s usage of and benefit from such programming.\nT\nhe principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of certain internally-produced television programming costs is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the amortization of certain internally-produced television programming costs monetized individually and as part of a film group.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the amortization of certain internally-produced television programming costs. These procedures also included, among others (i) recalculating the amortization of certain internally-produced television\nII-39\nprogramming costs on a sample basis and (ii) evaluating, on a test basis, whether the method used to amortize certain internally-produced television programming costs is reasonable by considering either a) information related to past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets, and future firm commitments to license programs for programming monetized on an individual basis, or b) information related to estimated timing of the usage of content for television programming monetized as part of a film group. Procedures were also performed to test the completeness and accuracy of management's data used in the amortization of certain internally-produced television programming costs.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 28, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s or its predecessor’s auditor since 1970.\nII-40\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nII-41\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nII-42\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nII-43\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nII-44\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(In millions)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nII-45\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1)\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business\n—Paramount Global, a global media, streaming and entertainment company that creates premium content and experiences for audiences worldwide, is comprised of the following segments:\n•\nTV Media—\nOur\nTV Media\nsegment consists of our (1) broadcast operations\n—\nthe CBS Television Network, our domestic broadcast television network; CBS Stations, our owned television stations; and our international free-to-air networks, Network 10, Channel 5, Telefe, and Chilevisión; (2) domestic premium and basic cable networks, including Paramount+ with Showtime (w\ne rebranded Showtime as Paramount+ with Showtime in January 2024)\n, MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, The Smithsonian Channel, Nickelodeon, BET Media Group, CBS Sports Network, and international extensions of certain of these brands; and (3) domestic and international television studio operations, including CBS Studios, Paramount Television Studios and Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios, as well as CBS Media Ventures, which produces and distributes first-run syndicated programming.\nTV Media\nalso includes a number of digital properties such as CBS News Streaming and CBS Sports HQ\n.\n•\nDirect-to-Consumer\n—\nOur\nDirect-to-Consumer\nsegment includes our portfolio of domestic and international pay and free streaming services, including Paramount+, Pluto TV, BET+ and Noggin. Effective June 27, 2023, we launched the Paramount+ with Showtime subscription plan in the United States (“U.S.”). Effective July 6, 2023, Showtime Networks’ domestic premium subscription service was no longer offered as a standalone subscription service for new subscribers.\n•\nFilmed Entertainment\n—\nOur\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment consists of Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation, Nickelodeon Studio, Awesomeness and Miramax\n.\nReferences to “Paramount,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Paramount Global and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nDiscontinued Operations\n—Simon & Schuster, which was sold during the fourth quarter of 2023, is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented (see Note 2). Simon & Schuster was reported as the\nPublishing\nsegment until we began presenting it as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Paramount, its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we are considered the primary beneficiary, after the elimination of intercompany transactions. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third party participating rights.  Investments over which we have a significant influence, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. For these investments, our proportionate share of net earnings or loss of the entity is recorded in “Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nReclassifications\n—Certain amounts reported for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.\nUse of Estimates\n—The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be\nII-46\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nBusiness Combinations\n—We generally account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, once control is obtained of a business, 100% of the assets, liabilities and certain contingent liabilities acquired, as well as amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at fair value. Any transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n—Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, including money market funds, commercial paper and bank time deposits.\nProgramming Inventory\n—We produce and acquire rights to programming to exhibit on our broadcast and cable networks, direct to consumers through our streaming services, on our broadcast television stations, and in theaters. We also produce programming for third parties. Costs for internally-produced and acquired programming inventory, including prepayments for such costs, are recorded within the non-current portion of “Programming and other inventory” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prepayments for the rights to air sporting and other live events that are expected to be expensed over the next 12 months are classified within the current portion of “Programming and other inventory” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCosts incurred to produce television programs and feature films (which include direct production costs, production overhead, acquisition costs and development costs) are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film. Costs incurred to acquire television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing and amortized over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.\nIn addition, production inventory is reduced by contributions from co-production partners, as applicable, and tax incentives earned for qualified production spending in certain U.S. states and international locations. As a result, the benefit of these items will be recognized through reduced amortization over the life of the related content.  Included in “Other current assets” and “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 were receivables for production tax incentives of $\n0.5\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion, respectively.\nWe categorize our capitalized production and programming costs based on the expected predominant monetization strategy throughout the life of the content.  Our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized through licensing and distribution on third-party platforms is considered individually monetized and our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized on our networks and streaming services together with other programming, is considered to be monetized as part of a film group. The predominant monetization strategy is determined when capitalization of production costs commences and is reassessed if there is a significant change to the expected future monetization strategy. This reassessment will include an assessment of the monetization strategy throughout the entire life of the programming.\nFor internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. The estimate of Ultimate Revenues impacts the timing of amortization of capitalized production\nII-47\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ncosts and expensing of participations and residual costs. For television programming, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within\n10\nyears from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production,\nfive years\nfrom the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.\nFor feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within\n10\nyears from the date of a film’s initial release. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. For acquired television and film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within\n20\nyears from the date of acquisition. Ultimate Revenue estimates are periodically reviewed and adjustments, if any, will result in changes to inventory amortization rates and estimated accruals for residuals and participations.\nFilm development costs that have not been set for production are expensed within\nthree years\nunless they are abandoned earlier, in which case these projects are written down to their estimated fair value in the period the decision to abandon the project is determined.\nFor programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received and amortized over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the relative value of the events broadcast by us during a period in relation to the estimated total value of the events over the term of the sports programming agreement.\nFor content that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis, a television program or feature film is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. Content that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and would similarly be tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the film group is less than its unamortized costs. If the carrying value of a film group or individual television program or feature film exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded in the amount of the difference. A change in the monetization strategy of content, whether monetized individually or as part of a film group, will result in a reassessment of the predominant monetization strategy and may trigger an assessment of the content for impairment. Any resulting impairment test will be performed either at the individual level or at the film group level where the future cash flows will be generated, as appropriate. In addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that has been abandoned are written off.\nTelevision and feature film programming and production costs, including inventory amortization, development costs, residuals and participations and impairment charges, if any, are included within “Operating expenses” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For 2023, programming charges, which include impairment charges, development cost write-offs and contract termination costs related to strategic changes to our businesses are included within “Programming charges” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nII-48\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nProperty and Equipment\n—Property and equipment is stated at cost.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:\nCosts associated with repairs and maintenance of property and equipment are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n—We assess long-lived assets and intangible assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of these asset groups is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups to their net carrying value. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the amount of impairment charge, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets.\nInvestments\n—Investments over which we have a significant influence, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. Equity investments for which we have no significant influence are measured at fair value where a readily determinable fair value exists. Equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable price changes. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of equity investments are recorded in “Gain (loss) from investments” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We monitor our investments for impairment and reduce the carrying value of the investment if we determine that an impairment charge is required based on qualitative and quantitative information. Our investments are included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n—Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are at or one level below our operating segments. Intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of trade names, licenses, and customer agreements are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from\n5\nto\n40\nyears. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, which consist primarily of FCC licenses, are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. If the carrying value of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized\n(see Note 5).\nGuarantees\n—At the inception of a guarantee, we recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing the guarantee. The related liability is subsequently reduced as utilized or extinguished and increased if there is a probable loss associated with the guarantee which exceeds the value of the recorded liability.\nTreasury Stock\n—Treasury stock is accounted for using the cost method. Retirements of treasury stock are reflected as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nFair Value Measurements\n—Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The framework for measuring fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or\nII-49\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nliability. Certain assets and liabilities, including foreign currency hedges and deferred compensation liabilities, are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Other assets and liabilities, including television and film production costs, lease assets, goodwill, intangible assets, and equity-method investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairment charges, if applicable, are generally determined using discounted cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n—Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in “Other items, net”\non the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n”\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently recognized in net earnings when the hedged items are recognized.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\n—The service cost component of net benefit cost for our pension and postretirement benefits is recorded on the same line items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as other compensation costs of the related employees. All of the other components of net benefit cost are presented separately from the service cost component and below the subtotal of operating income in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOther Liabilities\n—Other liabilities consist primarily of the noncurrent portion of residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses, long-term income tax liabilities, deferred compensation and other employee benefit accruals.\nRevenues\nRevenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer. Control is considered to be transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of that good or service.\nAdvertising Revenues\n—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or streamed or displayed on digital platforms. Advertising spots are typically sold as part of advertising campaigns consisting of multiple commercial units. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. Audience ratings and impressions are determined based on data provided by independent third-party companies. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.  Advertising contracts, which are generally short-term, are billed monthly, with payments due shortly after the invoice date.\nII-50\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAffiliate and Subscription Revenues\n—Affiliate and subscription revenues are principally comprised of affiliate fees received from distributors for carriage of our cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”) and our owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); affiliate fees received from television stations for their affiliation with the CBS Television Network (“reverse compensation”); and subscription fees for our subscription streaming services. Costs incurred for advertising, marketing and other services provided to us by cable, satellite and other distributors that are in exchange for a distinct service are recorded as expenses. If a distinct service is not received, such costs are recorded as a reduction to revenues.\nThe performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with certain distributors, also includes a license to programming for video-on-demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to\nour customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming. For affiliate revenues, payments are generally due monthly. Subscription revenues to our streaming services are recognized evenly over the subscription period.\nTheatrical Revenues\n—Theatrical revenue is earned from the theatrical distribution of our films during the exhibition period. Under these arrangements, revenues are recognized based on sales to the end customer.\nLicensing and Other Revenues\n—Licensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced or distributed for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include revenues from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) and electronic sell-through services, and the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and revenues from studio rentals and production services.\nFor licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues. Agreements to license programming are often long term, with collection terms ranging from\none\nto\nfive years\n.\nWhen payment is due from a customer more than one year before or after revenue is recognized, we consider the contract to contain a significant financing component and the transaction price is adjusted for the effects of the time value of money. We do not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money if payment is expected within one year of recognizing revenues.\nWe also license our programming to distributors of transactional video-on-demand and similar services. Under these arrangements, our performance obligation is the delivery of our content to such distributors who then license our content to the end customer. Our revenues are determined each month based on a contractual rate applied to\nII-51\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthe number of licenses to the distributors’ end customers. Similarly, revenues earned from electronic sell-through services are recognized as each program is downloaded by the end customer.\nRevenues associated with the licensing of our brands for consumer products, recreation and live events are generally determined based on contractual royalty rates applied to sales reported by the licensees. For consumer products and recreation arrangements that include minimum guaranteed consideration, revenue is recognized as sales occur by the licensee, if the sales-based consideration is expected to exceed the minimum guarantee, or ratably if it is not expected to exceed the minimum guarantee. For live events, we recognize revenue when the event is held.\nRevenues from the sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers are recognized upon the later of the physical delivery to the customer or the date that any sales restrictions on the retailers are lifted.\nWe earn revenues from the distribution of content on behalf of third parties. We also have arrangements for the distribution or sale of our content by third parties. Under such arrangements, we determine whether revenues should be recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer or the net amount of revenue we retain after payment to the third party producer or distributor, based on an assessment of which party controls the good or service being transferred.\nRevenue Allowances\n—DVDs and Blu-ray discs are generally sold with a right of return. We record a provision for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon an estimate of future returns, rebates and other incentives. In determining this provision, we consider sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecast sales data, customers’ rights of return, sales levels for units already shipped, historical return rates for similar products, current economic trends, the competitive environment, promotions and our sales strategies. Reserves for sales returns and allowances of $\n40\nmillion and $\n70\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are recorded in “Other current liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nReserves for accounts receivable reflect our expected credit losses, which are estimated based on historical experience, as well as current and expected economic conditions and industry trends. Our allowance for credit losses was $\n120\nmillion and $\n111\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense was $\n26\nmillion in 2023, $\n40\nmillion in 2022 and $\n8\nmillion in 2021. The expense in 2022 principally includes a charge for amounts due from customers in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022 (see Note 6).\nContract Liabilities\n—A contract liability is recorded when consideration is received from a customer prior to fully satisfying a performance obligation in a contract. Our contract liabilities primarily consist of cash received related to advertising arrangements for which the required audience rating or impressions have not been delivered; consumer products arrangements with minimum guarantees; and content licensing arrangements under which the content has not yet been made available to the customer. These contract liabilities will be recognized as revenues when control of the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Contract liabilities are included within “Deferred revenues” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCollaborative Arrangements\n—Collaborative arrangements primarily consist of joint efforts with third parties to produce and distribute programming such as television series and live sporting events, including the agreement between us and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. to telecast the\nNCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship\n(the “NCAA Tournament”), which runs through 2032. In connection with this agreement for the NCAA Tournament, advertisements aired on the CBS Television Network are recorded as revenues and our share of the program rights fees and other operating costs are recorded as operating expenses.\nII-52\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nWe also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute film and television programming, under which each partner is responsible for distribution of the program in specific territories or distribution windows. Under these arrangements, our share of costs for co-productions are initially capitalized as programming inventory and amortized over the estimated economic life of the program. In such arrangements where we have distribution rights, all proceeds generated from such distribution are recorded as revenues and any participation profits due to third party collaborators are recorded as participation expenses. In co-production arrangements where third party collaborators have distribution rights, our net participating profits are recorded as revenues.\nAmounts attributable to transactions arising from collaborative arrangements between participants were not material to the consolidated financial statements for any period presented.\nLeases\n—Our leases are principally comprised of operating leases for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities. We determine that a contract contains a lease if we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of, and the right to direct the use of, an asset identified in the contract. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability representing the present value of future lease payments. The discount rate used to measure the lease asset and liability is determined at the beginning of the lease term using the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable, or our collateralized incremental borrowing rate. For those contracts that include fixed rental payments for both the use of the asset (“lease costs”) as well as for other occupancy or service costs relating to the asset (“non-lease costs”), we generally include both the lease costs and non-lease costs in the measurement of the lease asset and liability. We also own buildings and production facilities where we lease space to lessees.\nOur leases generally have remaining terms of up to\n15\nyears and often contain renewal options to extend the lease for periods of generally up to\n10\nyears. For leases that contain renewal options, we include the renewal period in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense and income for our operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the exception of variable lease costs, which are expensed as incurred, and leases of assets used in the production of programming, which are capitalized in programming assets and amortized over the projected useful life of the related programming.\nAdvertising\n—Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe incurred total advertising expenses of $\n2.90\nbillion in 2023, $\n2.69\nbillion in 2022 and $\n2.14\nbillion in 2021.\nInterest\n—Costs associated with the refinancing or issuance of debt, as well as debt discounts or premiums, are recorded as interest over the term of the related debt.\nIncome Taxes\n—The provision for/benefit from income taxes includes federal, state, local, and foreign taxes. We recognize the tax on global intangible low-taxed income, a U.S. tax on certain income earned by our foreign subsidiaries, within the provision for income taxes as a period cost when incurred.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor tax positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon\nII-53\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nexamination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized.  A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. We recognize interest and penalty charges related to the reserve for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\n—Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while results of operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for the respective periods. The resulting translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Argentina has been designated as a highly inflationary economy during all periods presented. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency will result in remeasurement gains and losses, which are included in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNet Earnings (Loss) per Common Share\n—Basic net earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is based upon net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders is calculated as net earnings (loss) from continuing operations or net earnings (loss), as applicable, adjusted to include dividends on our\n5.75\n% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”), which was issued in March 2021 (see Note 14).\nWeighted average shares for diluted EPS reflects the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted share units (“RSUs”) or performance share units (“PSUs”) only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive. Diluted EPS also reflects the effect of the assumed conversion of preferred stock, if dilutive, which includes the issuance of common shares in the weighted average number of shares and excludes the above-mentioned preferred stock dividend adjustment to net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, all of our stock options and RSUs, which totaled\n19\nmillion, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been antidilutive since we reported a net loss.  Stock options and RSUs totaling\n11\nmillion and\n6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Also excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was the effect of the assumed conversion of our\n10\nmillion shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock because the impact would have been antidilutive.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.\nII-54\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAdditionally, because the impact of the assumed conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock would have been antidilutive, net earnings (loss) from continuing operations and net earnings (loss) used in our calculation of diluted EPS for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 include the preferred stock dividends recorded during the period.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) from continuing operations and net earnings (loss) to the amounts used in the calculations of basic and diluted EPS.\nStock-based Compensation\n—We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued updated guidance for segment reporting, which requires the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within the reported measure of segment profit or loss (“segment measure”), as well as the disclosure of the other segment items comprising the difference between segment revenues less these significant segment expenses and the segment measure. The update also requires an entity to disclose the title and position of the CODM and to describe how the CODM utilizes the segment measure to assess segment performance and allocate resources. In addition, the update aligns the interim disclosure requirements for segment profit or loss and assets with the annual requirements. The update is effective for us for the year ended December 31, 2024, and for interim periods beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted.\nII-55\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance enhancing annual income tax disclosures. Under this guidance, certain enhancements to the effective tax rate reconciliation disclosure are required, including the inclusion of both percentages and amounts, specific categories, and additional information for reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold defined by the guidance. Additionally, disclosures of income taxes paid and income tax expense must be disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes, with income taxes paid further disaggregated for individual jurisdictions that represent 5 percent or more of total income taxes paid. The guidance is effective for us starting with the year ended December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The amendment will be applied on a prospective basis, with the option to apply the guidance retrospectively.\n2)\nDISPOSITIONS AND ACQUISITIONS\nDispositions\nSimon & Schuster\nOn October 30, 2023, we completed the sale of Simon & Schuster to affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for $\n1.62\nbillion. As a result, we recognized a pretax gain during the fourth quarter of 2023 of $\n695\nmillion.\nThe following tables set forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, which primarily relates to Simon & Schuster.\nII-56\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a) Primarily relates to indemnification obligations for leases associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. (“Famous Players”).\n(b) The tax provision on the\ngain on sale\ndiffers from the amount that would be expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily because the goodwill was not deductible for tax purposes.\n(c) In accordance with the terms of a previous agreement to sell Simon & Schuster, we received a $\n200\nmillion termination payment after the U.S. Department of Justice prevailed in its suit to block the sale.\nThe following table presents the major classes of assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations prior to the sale of Simon & Schuster.\nOther\nIn September 2022, in connection with our funding commitments under our streaming joint venture with Comcast Corporation, SkyShowtime, we made a noncash contribution of certain assets of Paramount+ in the Nordics to the joint venture, which resulted in a gain of $\n41\nmillion. Also in 2022, we recorded gains on dispositions totaling $\n15\nmillion, comprised of a gain from the sale of international intangible assets and a working capital adjustment to the gain from the fourth quarter 2021 sale of CBS Studio Center, which is described below.\nDuring October 2021, we completed the sale of 51 West 52nd Street, an office tower that was formerly the headquarters of CBS, to Harbor Group International, LLC, for $\n760\nmillion, resulting in a gain of $\n523\nmillion.\nIn December 2021, we completed the sale of CBS Studio Center to a partnership formed by Hackman Capital Partners, LLC and Square Mile Capital Management, LLC for $\n1.85\nbillion. At closing, we executed a\n10\n-year\nII-57\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nlease-back of the portion of a building on the property that is used by our Los Angeles television stations. The lease-back began at the time of the sale and includes an option to terminate\none\nfloor without penalty beginning on the fifth anniversary. The sale resulted in a gain of $\n1.70\nbillion.\nIn addition, during 2021 we recognized a net gain of $\n117\nmillion, principally relating to the sale of a noncore trademark licensing operation.\nAcquisitions\nDuring 2021, we made payments totaling $\n54\nmillion, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Chilevisión, a free-to-air television channel, and a controlling interest in Fox TeleColombia & Estudios TeleMexico, a Spanish language content producer. The results of these companies are included in the\nTV Media\nsegment from the dates of acquisition. The operating results of these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements in the year of acquisition.\n3)\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nII-58\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n4)\nPROGRAMMING AND OTHER INVENTORY\nThe following table presents our programming and other inventory at December 31, 2023 and 2022, grouped by type and predominant monetization strategy.\nThe following table presents amortization of our television and film programming and production costs, which is included within “\nOperating expenses\n” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nProgramming Charges\nDuring 2023, in connection with the integration of Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms, we performed a comprehensive strategic review of the combined content portfolio of Showtime and Paramount+. Additionally, we commenced a review of our international content portfolio in connection with initiatives to rationalize and right-size our international operations to align with our streaming strategy, and close or globalize certain of our international channels. As a result, we changed the strategy for certain content, which led to content being removed from our platforms or abandoned, the write-off of development costs, distribution changes, and termination of programming agreements. Accordingly, we recorded programming charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations relating to these actions during the first half of 2023. These charges, which totaled $\n2.37\nbillion, were comprised of $\n1.97\nbillion for the impairment of content to its estimated fair value, as well as $\n402\nmillion for development cost write-offs and contract termination costs. For content that was removed from our platforms or abandoned, the estimated fair value was determined using assumptions for secondary market licensing revenues, if any.\nII-59\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nIn connection with our continued review of our international content strategy, during the first quarter of 2024 we made a strategic decision to focus on content with mass global appeal. As part of this, we are rationalizing original content on Paramount+, especially internationally, and improving the efficiency of our linear network programming. As a result, we have reviewed our expansive global content portfolio and are removing select content from our platforms. In addition, we have decided not to move forward with certain titles and therefore are abandoning some development projects and terminating certain programming agreements. Accordingly, we expect to recognize additional programming charges that we currently expect to be in the range of approximately $\n700\nmillion to $\n900\nmillion during the first quarter of 2024. As we continue to evaluate our content portfolio, we may incur additional programming charges later in 2024.\nThe following table presents the estimated expected amortization over each of the next three years of released programming inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023. This information does not include the expected effects of the 2024 programming charges discussed above.\nDuring the year ending December 31, 2024, we expect to amortize approximately $\n143\nmillion of our completed, not yet released film inventory, which is monetized on an individual basis.\n5)\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nWe perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses, on an annual basis, and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. At December 31, 2023, we had\nfive\nreporting units. FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2023, we had\n14\ntelevision markets with FCC license book values, which totaled $\n2.31\nbillion.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for the reporting units and television markets with FCC licenses that we estimate have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In making this determination, we also consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2023 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for\nsix\nof our television markets and all of our reporting units. Considering the aggregation of all relevant factors, including the significant headroom in our most recent tests, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and the fair value of FCC licenses within each of these markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test for these reporting units and FCC licenses was unnecessary.\nFor the 2023 annual test for FCC licenses, we performed a quantitative impairment test for the remaining\neight\nmarkets. The quantitative impairment test of FCC licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding\nII-60\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ndiscounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections. The discount rate and the long-term growth rate were\n9\n% and\n1\n%, respectively.\nThe impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in\nfive\nof the markets were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $\n83\nmillion to write down the carrying values of these FCC licenses to their aggregate estimated fair value of $\n887\nmillion. The impairment charge, which is recorded within the\nTV Media\nsegment, was primarily due to increased market volatility and higher interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior quarters of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, which resulted in a higher discount rate.\nThe estimated fair values of FCC licenses in the\nthree\nremaining markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of $\n357\nmillion were within\n10\n% of their carrying values.\nThe following tables present the changes in the book value of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nII-61\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOur intangible assets were as follows:\nII-62\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAmortization expense was as follows:\nWe expect our aggregate annual amortization expense for existing intangible assets subject to amortization for each of the years, 2024 through 2028, to be as follows:\n6)\nRESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CORPORATE MATTERS\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded the following restructuring charges and other corporate matters.\n(a) Severance costs include the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation.\nRestructuring Charges\nSince the merger of Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”) (the “Merger”), we implemented a series of initiatives designed to integrate and transform our operations, including changes in management structure. These initiatives led to restructuring actions, and as a result, we recorded restructuring charges for severance of $\n67\nmillion, $\n260\nmillion, and $\n65\nmillion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The actions that gave rise to the severance costs included our 2022 operating segment realignment, the integration of Showtime into Paramount+, and the restructuring of our international operations. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2023, certain eligible employees voluntarily elected to participate in a plan under which they will receive one-time severance benefits, resulting in $\n13\nmillion of severance costs.\nII-63\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nIn the years following the Merger, we also consolidated our real estate portfolio to reduce our real estate footprint and create cost synergies. In connection with this consolidation, we identified lease assets that we determined we would not use and instead sublease or terminate early, which resulted in lease impairment charges of $\n35\nmillion, $\n68\nmillion, and $\n35\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the lease assets that we plan to sublease, the impairment charges were the result of a decline in market conditions since the inception of these leases and reflect the difference between the estimated fair values, which were determined based on the expected discounted future cash flows of the lease assets, and the carrying values.\nThe following is a rollforward of our restructuring liability, which is recorded in “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2023, which principally relates to severance payments, is expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2024.\n(a) For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, excludes stock-based compensation expense of $\n5\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion, respectively, and lease asset impairments of $\n35\nmillion and $\n68\nmillion, respectively.\nOther Corporate Matters\nIn 2023, we recorded a net benefit of $\n133\nmillion in other corporate matters, principally consisting of a gain of $\n120\nmillion from a settlement received in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the final dismissal of the CBS Litigation, as well as insurance recoveries relating to the Viacom Litigation (each as defined and further described under\nLegal Matters\n—\nStockholder Matters—Litigation Relating to the Merger\nin Note 19). These benefits are partially offset by a charge of $\n23\nmillion to increase our accrual for asbestos matters as discussed under\nLegal Matters\n—\nClaims Related to Former Businesses—Asbestos\nin Note 19.\nIn 2022, we recorded charges for other corporate matters of $\n257\nmillion, consisting of $\n211\nmillion associated with stockholder legal matters, principally relating to the Merger, including a charge for the settlement of $\n122.5\nmillion in connection with the final dismissal of the Viacom Litigation. The charges also included $\n46\nmillion recorded following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, principally to reserve against amounts due from counterparties in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.\nII-64\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n7)\nRELATED PARTIES\nNational Amusements, Inc.\nNational Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”) is the controlling stockholder of the Company. At December 31, 2023, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately\n77.4\n% of our voting Class A Common Stock, and approximately\n9.7\n% of our Class A Common Stock and non-voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. NAI is controlled by the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Part B General Trust (the “General Trust”), which owns\n80\n% of the voting interest of NAI. NA Administration, LLC is the corporate trustee of the General Trust and is governed by a\nseven\n-member board of directors, which acts by majority vote (subject to certain exceptions), including with respect to the NAI shares held by the General Trust. Shari E. Redstone, Chairperson, CEO and President of NAI and non-executive Chair of our Board of Directors, is one of the\nseven\ndirectors of NA Administration, LLC and one of\ntwo\ndirectors who are beneficiaries of the General Trust. No member of our management or other member of our Board of Directors is a director of NA Administration, LLC.\nOther Related Parties\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in transactions with our equity-method investees, primarily for the licensing of television and film programming.\nThe following tables present the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements related to these transactions.\nThrough the normal course of business, we are involved in other transactions with related parties that have not been material in any of the periods presented.\n8)\nREVENUES\nThe table below presents our revenues disaggregated into categories based on the nature of such revenues. See Note 18 for revenues by segment disaggregated into these categories.\nII-65\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nReceivables\nIncluded in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are noncurrent receivables of $\n1.39\nbillion and $\n1.61\nbillion at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Noncurrent receivables primarily relate to revenues recognized under long-term content licensing arrangements. Revenues from the licensing of content are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, while the related cash is generally collected over the term of the license period.\nOur receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2023 or 2022, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities are included within “Deferred revenues” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $\n0.8\nbillion, $\n1.06\nbillion and $\n1.20\nbillion at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We recognized revenues of $\n0.9\nbillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 that were included in the opening balance of deferred revenues for the respective year.\nUnrecognized Revenues Under Contract\nAt December 31, 2023, unrecognized revenues attributable to unsatisfied performance obligations under our long-term contracts were approximately $\n8\nbillion, of which $\n4\nbillion is expected to be recognized in 2024, $\n2\nbillion in 2025, $\n1\nbillion in 2026, and $\n1\nbillion thereafter. These amounts only include contracts subject to a guaranteed fixed amount or the guaranteed minimum under variable contracts, primarily consisting of television and film licensing contracts and affiliate agreements that are subject to a fixed or guaranteed minimum fee. Such amounts change on a regular basis as we renew existing agreements or enter into new agreements. In addition, the timing of satisfying certain of the performance obligations under these long-term contracts is uncertain and, therefore, is also subject to change. Unrecognized revenues under contracts disclosed above do not include (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, mainly consisting of advertising contracts (ii) contracts for which variable consideration is determined based on the customer’s subsequent sale or usage, mainly consisting of affiliate agreements and (iii) long-term licensing agreements for multiple programs for which variable consideration is determined based on the value of the programs delivered to the customer and our right to invoice corresponds with the value delivered.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied in Previous Periods\nUnder certain revenue arrangements, the amount and timing of our revenue recognition is determined based on our licensees’ subsequent sale to its end customers. As a result, under such arrangements, we often satisfy our performance obligation of delivery of our content in advance of revenue recognition. We recognized revenues of $\n0.4\nbillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, from arrangements for the licensing of our content, including from distributors of transactional video-on-demand and electronic sell-through services and other licensing arrangements, as well as from the theatrical distribution of our films, for which our performance obligation was satisfied in a prior period.\nII-66\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n9)\nDEBT\nOur debt consists of the following\n:\n(a) At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the senior and junior subordinated debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $\n419\nmillion and $\n442\nmillion, respectively, and (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of $\n81\nmillion and $\n89\nmillion, respectively. The face value of our total debt was $\n15.10\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and $\n16.38\nbillion at December 31, 2022.\nSenior Debt\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased $\n1.04\nbillion of our outstanding senior notes due between 2025 and 2027 through a tender offer, for an aggregate repurchase price of $\n1.00\nbillion. These repurchases resulted in a pre-tax gain on extinguishment of debt of $\n29\nmillion. In 2023, we also repaid our $\n139\nmillion of\n7.875\n% debentures and $\n35\nmillion of\n7.125\n% senior notes, each at maturity.\nIn 2022, we redeemed senior notes totaling $\n2.39\nbillion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $\n2.49\nbillion and redeemed, at par, our $\n520\nmillion of\n5.875\n% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057. These redemptions resulted in a total pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n120\nmillion.\nII-67\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nIn 2021, we redeemed senior notes totaling $\n1.99\nbillion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $\n2.11\nbillion resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n128\nmillion.\nOur outstanding senior notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for $\n9.67\nbillion of the senior notes and debentures that requires us to make a redemption offer at\n101\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of ratings downgrades to below investment grade by all three ratings agencies (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Ltd.) due to a change of control.\nJunior Debt\nIn 2022, we issued $\n1.00\nbillion of\n6.375\n% junior subordinated debentures due 2062. The interest rate on these debentures will reset on March 30, 2027, and every\nfive years\nthereafter to a fixed rate equal to the 5-year Treasury Rate (as defined pursuant to the terms of the debentures) plus a spread of\n3.999\n% from March 30, 2027,\n4.249\n% from March 30, 2032 and\n4.999\n% from March 30, 2047. These debentures can be called by us at par plus a make whole premium any time before March 30, 2027, or at par on March 30, 2027 or on any interest payment date thereafter.\nOur $\n643\nmillion of\n6.25\n% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rate until February 28, 2027, on which date the rate will switch to a floating rate. Under the terms of the debentures the floating rate is based on three-month LIBOR plus\n3.899\n%, reset quarterly, however, with the phasing out of LIBOR and the passage of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, signed into law on March 15, 2022, it is expected that the\n6.25\n% junior subordinated debentures due 2057 will, upon switching to a floating rate, bear interest at a replacement rate based on three-month CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). These debentures can be called by us at par at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period.\nOur junior subordinated debentures also provide for certain covenant packages. In the event of ratings downgrades by all three rating agencies due to a change of control, there is a provision in the junior subordinated debentures that requires us to either elect to redeem the debentures at\n101\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or, if we elect not to redeem the debentures, the interest rate will be increased by\n5\npercentage points.\nLong-Term Debt Maturities\nAt December 31, 2023, our scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, which excludes payments for the related interest and finance leases, were as follows:\nCommercial Paper\nAt both December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had\nno\noutstanding commercial paper borrowings.\nCredit Facility\nDuring 2023, we amended and extended our $\n3.50\nbillion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), which now matures in January 2027 (the “2023 Amendment”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are\nII-68\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ndetermined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered into. Under the 2023 Amendment, we replaced LIBOR as the benchmark rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars with Term SOFR. The benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR, respectively. The Credit Facility also includes a provision that the occurrence of a change of control of Paramount will be an event of default that would give the lenders the right to accelerate any outstanding loans and terminate their commitments. At December 31, 2023, we had\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the availability under the Credit Facility was $\n3.50\nbillion.\nThe Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant which sets a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (“Leverage Ratio”) at the end of each quarter, which prior to the 2023 Amendment was\n4.5\nx. Under the 2023 Amendment, the maximum Leverage Ratio was increased to\n5.75\nx for each quarter through and including the quarter ending September 30, 2024, and will then decrease to\n5.5\nx for the quarters ending December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, with decreases of\n0.25\nx for each subsequent quarter until it reaches\n4.5\nx for the quarter ending March 31, 2026. The Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. Under the 2023 Amendment, the definition of the Leverage Ratio was also modified to set the maximum amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that can be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness to $\n1.50\nbillion for quarters ending on or after September 30, 2024. In addition, under the 2023 Amendment, Simon & Schuster was treated as a continuing operation for the purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA until its disposition in October 2023. We met the covenant as of December 31, 2023.\nOther Bank Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2023, we had\nno\noutstanding bank borrowings under Miramax’s $\n50\nmillion credit facility, which matures in November 2024. This facility replaced the previous $\n300\nmillion credit facility that matured in April 2023. At December 31, 2022, we had $\n55\nmillion of bank borrowings under the previous facility with a weighted average interest rate of\n7.09\n%.\n10)\nLEASES\nLessee Contracts\nWe have operating leases primarily for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities. We also have finance leases for equipment, which were not material for the periods presented. Lease costs are generally fixed, with certain contracts containing variable payments for non-lease costs based on usage and escalations in the lessors’ annual costs.\nII-69\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to our operating leases.\nThe following table presents our lease cost relating to our operating leases.\n(a) Includes fixed lease costs and non-lease costs (consisting of other occupancy and service costs relating to the use of an asset) associated with long-term operating leases.\n(b) Includes costs capitalized in programming assets during the period for leased assets used in the production of programming.\n(c) Short-term leases, which are not recorded in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, have a term of 12 months or less and exclude month-to-month leases.\n(d) Primarily includes non-lease costs (consisting of other occupancy and service costs relating to the use of an asset) and costs for equipment leases that vary based on usage.\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information for our operating leases.\nII-70\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe expected future payments relating to our operating lease liabilities at December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had no material leases that were executed but not yet commenced.\nLessor Contracts\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded\ntotal lease income\nof $\n34\nmillion, $\n65\nmillion and $\n145\nmillion, respectively, which relates to operating leases of our owned production facilities and office buildings. Lease payments received under these agreements consist of fixed payments for the rental of space and certain building operating costs, as well as variable payments based on usage of production facilities and services, and escalating costs of building operations. Lease income in 2023 was negatively impacted by temporary production shutdowns due to labor strikes. In 2021, lease income included amounts from a production facility and an office building before they were sold in the fourth quarter (see Note 2). Our future fixed lease income is not expected to be material.\n11)\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe carrying value of our financial instruments approximates fair value, except for notes and debentures. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $\n14.60\nbillion and $\n15.78\nbillion, respectively, and the fair value, which is determined based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) was $\n13.6\nbillion and $\n13.9\nbillion, respectively.\nInvestments\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are equity-method investments of $\n96\nmillion and $\n375\nmillion, respectively, and equity investments without a readily determinable fair value for which we have no significant influence of $\n612\nmillion and $\n70\nmillion, respectively. In April 2023, our ownership of Viacom18 was diluted from\n49\n% to\n13\n% following investment by other parties. Accordingly, we no longer account for it under the equity method and instead account for it as an investment without a readily determinable fair value. Upon dilution, the difference between the carrying value of our\n49\n% interest and the fair value of our\n13\n% interest, as indicated by the additional investments, resulted in a noncash gain of $\n168\nmillion, which was recorded in “Gain (loss) from investments” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2023.\nAt December 31, 2023, our equity-method investments include a\n50\n% interest in SkyShowtime, a joint venture formed in 2022, which launched a new subscription streaming service in certain European territories, as well as interests in several international television joint ventures. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2021, “Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations included impairment charges of $\n16\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion, respectively, relating to television joint ventures.\nII-71\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nIn 2022, we sold a\n37.5\n% interest in The CW to Nexstar Media Inc. and received a noncash distribution of $\n139\nmillion, comprised of certain licensing receivables earned by The CW prior to the sale. This transaction, which reduced our ownership in The CW to\n12.5\n%, resulted in a loss of $\n4\nmillion, which principally consists of transaction costs. This loss, along with an impairment of an investment of $\n5\nmillion, is recorded in “Gain (loss) from investments” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2022.\nFor 2021, “Gain (loss) from investments” of $\n47\nmillion on the Consolidated Statement of Operations primarily includes a gain of $\n37\nmillion on the sale of an investment without a readily determinable fair value and a gain of $\n9\nmillion from an increase in the fair value of a marketable security, which was sold in the third quarter of 2021.\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nWe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nForeign exchange forward contracts have principally been used to hedge projected cash flows in currencies such as the British pound, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar, generally for periods up to\n24\nmonths. We designate foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $\n2.72\nbillion and $\n3.06\nbillion, respectively. For 2023, $\n2.20\nbillion related to future production costs and $\n523\nmillion\nrelated to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2022, $\n2.40\nbillion related to future production costs and $\n655\nmillion related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.\nGains (losses) recognized on derivative financial instruments were as follows:\nWe continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\nII-72\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n12)\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe table below presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022. These assets and liabilities have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. All of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis use Level 2 inputs. The fair value of foreign currency hedges is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using observable inputs including foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of deferred compensation liabilities is determined based on the fair value of the investments elected by employees.\nThe estimated fair values of our impaired content and FCC licenses (see Notes 4 and 5, respectively) were determined using Level 3 inputs.\n13)\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into joint ventures or make investments with business partners that support our underlying business strategy and provide us the ability to enter new markets to expand the reach of our brands, develop new programming and/or distribute our existing content. In certain instances, an entity in which we make an investment may qualify as a VIE. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we assess whether we have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe following tables present the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements related to our consolidated VIEs.\nII-73\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n14)\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nIn general, the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have the same economic rights; however, holders of the Company’s Class B Common Stock do not have any voting rights, except as required by law. Holders of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are entitled to\none\nvote per share with respect to all matters on which the holders of the Company’s Common Stock are entitled to vote.\nStock Offerings\nOn March 26, 2021, we completed offerings of\n20\nmillion shares of our Class B Common Stock at a price to the public of $\n85\nper share and\n10\nmillion shares of\n5.75\n% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at a price to the public and liquidation preference of $\n100\nper share. The net proceeds from the Class B Common Stock offering and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offering were approximately $\n1.67\nbillion and $\n983\nmillion, respectively, in each case after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. As of December 31, 2023, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of $\n1\nbillion.\nMandatory Convertible Preferred Stock\nUnless earlier converted, each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically and mandatorily convert on the mandatory conversion date, expected to be April 1, 2024, into between\n1.0013\nand\n1.1765\nshares of our Class B Common Stock, subject to customary antidilution adjustments. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion will be determined based on the average of the volume-weighted average price per share of our Class B Common Stock over the\n20\nconsecutive trading day period commencing on, and including, the\n21\nst scheduled trading day immediately preceding April 1, 2024. Holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Holders”) have the right to convert all or any portion of their shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at any time prior to April 1, 2024 at the minimum conversion rate of\n1.0013\nshares of our Class B Common Stock. In addition, the conversion rate applicable to such an early conversion may, in certain circumstances, be increased to compensate Holders for certain unpaid accumulated dividends. However, if a fundamental change (as defined in the Certificate of Designations governing the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock) occurs on or prior to April 1, 2024, then Holders will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to convert all or a portion of their shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at an increased conversion rate for a specified period of time and receive an amount to compensate them for unpaid accumulated dividends and any remaining future scheduled dividend payments. In 2023 and 2022, conversions of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock into Class B Common Stock were minimal.\nThe Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is not redeemable. However, at our option, we may purchase or otherwise acquire (including in an exchange transaction) the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock from time to time in the open market, by tender or exchange offer or otherwise, without the consent of, or notice to, Holders. Holders have no voting rights, with certain exceptions.\nIf declared, dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are payable quarterly through April 1, 2024. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock accumulate from the most recent dividend payment date, and will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, at an annual rate of\n5.75\n% of the liquidation preference of $\n100\nper share, payable in cash or, subject to certain limitations, by delivery of shares of Class B Common Stock or through any combination of cash and shares of Class B Common Stock, at our election. If we have not declared any portion of the accumulated and unpaid dividends by April 1, 2024, the conversion rate will be adjusted so that Holders receive an additional number of shares of our Class B Common Stock, with certain limitations.\nII-74\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nDividends\nThe following table presents dividends declared per share and total dividends for our Class A and Class B Common Stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n(a) We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n.24\nper share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during the first quarter of 2023 and each of the quarters of 2022 and 2021. Beginning with the second quarter of 2023 and for the remaining quarters of 2023, we declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B Common Stock of $\n.05\nper share.\n(b) During the second quarter of 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n1.5493\nper share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, representing a dividend period from March 26, 2021 through July 1, 2021. For all subsequent quarters, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n1.4375\nper share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nTreasury Stock\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $\n2.36\nbillion of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. We did\nno\nt repurchase any shares of our common stock in the three years ended December 31, 2023.\nCommon Stock Conversion Rights\nHolders of Class A Common Stock have the right to convert their shares to Class B Common Stock as long as there are at least\n5,000\nshares of Class A Common Stock outstanding. In 2023 and 2022, conversions of Class A Common Stock into Class B Common Stock were minimal. In 2021, conversions of Class A Common Stock into Class B Common Stock were\n11.6\nmillion.\nII-75\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe following table presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n(a) Reflects cumulative translation adjustments.\n(b) Reflects amortization of net actuarial losses, which for 2021 includes the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans (see Note 17).\n(c) Reflects amounts realized within “Gain (loss) from investments” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in connection with the dilution of our interest in Viacom18 (see Note 11).\n(d) Reflects amounts realized within “Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in connection with the sale of Simon & Schuster (see Note 2).\nThe net actuarial loss and prior service cost related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans included in other comprehensive income (loss) is net of a tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 of $\n14\nmillion, $\n108\nmillion and $\n25\nmillion, respectively.\n15)\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe have long-term equity-based incentive plans (the “Plans”) under which stock options, RSUs and PSUs are issued. The purpose of the Plans is to benefit and advance the interests of our company by attracting, retaining and motivating participants and to compensate participants for their contributions to the financial success of our company. The Plans provide for awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted shares, RSUs, dividend equivalents, performance awards and other equity-related awards. RSUs and PSUs accrue dividends each time we declare a quarterly cash dividend, which are paid upon vesting when the shares are delivered and are forfeited if the award does not vest. Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs and PSUs, we issue new shares from our existing authorization. At December 31, 2023, there were\n24\nmillion shares available for future grant under the Plans. Stock-based compensation awards were also granted under Viacom’s equity incentive plans until December 31, 2020. Upon exercise of outstanding stock options or vesting of RSUs and PSUs previously granted under Viacom’s equity incentive plans, shares may be issued from Viacom’s previous authorization or from treasury stock.\nII-76\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n(a) Reflects accelerations as a result of restructuring activities.\nIncluded in net earnings from discontinued operations was stock-based compensation expense of $\n2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $\n3\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nRSUs and PSUs\nCompensation expense for RSUs is determined based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, which is generally a\none\n- to\nfour-year\nservice period.   Forfeitures for RSUs are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates and adjusted based on actual forfeitures. On an annual basis, we revise the estimated forfeiture rate, as necessary.\nFor PSU awards with a market condition, the number of shares to be issued upon vesting is based on the total shareholder return of the Company’s Class B Common Stock measured against the companies comprising the S&P 500 Index or a defined peer group over a designated measurement period. Certain other PSU awards are based on the achievement of established internal operating goals. The fair value of PSU awards with a market condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, and is expensed over the required employee service period. Compensation expense for these PSUs is not adjusted for the actual number of shares issued based on the outcome of the market condition for completed performance periods. The fair value of PSU awards with internal performance conditions is based on the market price of the shares on the date of grant, and is expensed based on the probable outcome of internal performance metrics and subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual shares issued based on the outcome of the performance metrics for completed performance periods. For all PSU awards, if the required service period is not completed, the award is forfeited, and compensation expense is adjusted. The fair value of PSU awards granted during each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n43\nmillion and for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $\n3\nmillion.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted was $\n22.83\n,\n$\n31.58\nand $\n35.80\nin 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The total market value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $\n74\nmillion, $\n77\nmillion and $\n260\nmillion, respectively. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs and PSUs at December 31, 2023 was $\n256\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.01\nyears.\nII-77\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table summarizes our RSU and PSU share activity:\n(a) Grant activity includes\n1.4\nmillion of PSUs at target for 2023.\nStock Options\nCompensation expense for stock options is determined based on the grant date fair value of the award calculated using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. Stock options generally vest over a\nthree\n- to\nfour-year\nservice period and expire\neight years\nfrom the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. We adjust the compensation expense based on actual forfeitures.\nThere were\nno\nstock option grants during any of the periods presented.\nAt December 31, 2023, all stock options are vested and there is\nno\nremaining unrecognized compensation cost.\nThe following table summarizes our stock option activity under the Plans.\nThe following table summarizes other information relating to stock option exercises during the year ended December 31, 2021. There were\nno\nstock option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAt December 31, 2023, stock options outstanding and exercisable have a weighted average remaining contractual life of\n1.78\nyears. There was\nno\nintrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable, based on our closing stock price of $\n14.79\nat December 31, 2023.\nII-78\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n16)\nINCOME TAXES\nThe U.S. and foreign components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies were as follows:\nThe components of the (benefit from) provision for income taxes were as follows:\nIn addition, included in net earnings from discontinued operations was an income tax provision of $\n249\nmillion, $\n77\nmillion and $\n57\nmillion for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nThe equity in loss of investee companies is shown net of tax on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The tax benefit relating to losses from equity investments was $\n10\nmillion in 2023, $\n33\nmillion in 2022 and $\n49\nmillion in 2021, which represented an effective tax rate of\n2.7\n%,\n13.9\n% and\n35.0\n% for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nII-79\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe difference between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and the (benefit from) provision for income taxes is summarized as follows:\n(a) For 2022, reflects a deferred tax benefit resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations. The related deferred tax asset is primarily expected to be realized over a\n25-year\nperiod. For 2021, reflects a tax benefit from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary.\nThe following table summarizes the components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition to the amounts reflected in the table above at December 31, 2022, included in “Assets of discontinued operations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are net deferred income tax assets of $\n55\nmillion.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had deferred income tax assets for federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $\n38\nmillion and net operating loss carryforwards for federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions of $\n259\nmillion,\nII-80\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthe majority of which expire in various years from 2024 through 2038. The deferred tax asset for the U.S. interest limitation carryforward of $\n63\nmillion at December 31, 2023 has an indefinite carryforward period.\nThe 2023 and 2022 deferred income tax assets were reduced by a valuation allowance of $\n498\nmillion and $\n488\nmillion, respectively, principally relating to income tax benefits from capital losses and net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions which are not expected to be realized.\nGenerally, the future remittance of foreign undistributed earnings will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes and as a result, for substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries, we do not intend to assert indefinite reinvestment of both cash held outside of the U.S. and future cash earnings. However, a future repatriation of cash could be subject to state and local income taxes, foreign income taxes, tax on foreign currency translation gains and losses, and withholding taxes. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2023, we recorded deferred income tax liabilities associated with future repatriations of $\n11\nmillion on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additional income taxes have not been provided for outside basis differences inherent in these entities, which could be recognized upon sale or other transaction, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely invested in foreign operations. The determination of the U.S. federal deferred income tax liability for such outside basis difference is not practicable.\nThe following table sets forth the change in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding related accrued interest and penalties.\nThe reserve for uncertain tax positions of $\n286\nmillion at December 31, 2023 includes $\n253\nmillion which would affect our effective income tax rate, if and when recognized in future years. We recognized interest and penalties of $\n26\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $\n14\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Liabilities for accrued interest and penalties totaling $\n87\nmillion and $\n67\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are included within “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nII-81\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and various state and local and foreign jurisdictions. For periods prior to the Merger, Viacom and CBS filed separate tax returns. For CBS, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company and the IRS settled the income tax audit for the 2017 and 2018 tax years with the exception of one item. This item is currently being resolved through the Mutual Agreement Procedure process. For Viacom, we are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. For tax returns filed as a merged company, we are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2019 tax year. Various tax years are also currently under examination by state and local and foreign tax authorities. With respect to open tax years in all jurisdictions, we currently do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain tax positions will significantly change within the next 12 months; however, it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter and events could cause our current expectation to change in the future.\n17)\nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, principally non-contributory, covering eligible employees. Our pension plans consist of both funded and unfunded plans, and our domestic plans are frozen to future benefit accruals. The majority of participants in these plans are retired employees or former employees of previously divested businesses. Plan benefits are based primarily on an employee’s years of service and pay for each year that the employee participated in the plan. We fund our pension plans in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other applicable law, rules and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of corporate bonds, equity securities, common collective trust funds, U.S. government securities and short-term investments. The Company’s Common Stock represented approximately\n1.0\n% and\n1.2\n% of the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn addition, the Company sponsors health and welfare plans that provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees and their covered dependents. Eligibility is based in part on certain age and service requirements at the time of their retirement. Most of the plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance which are adjusted annually, as well as caps on the annual dollar amount we will contribute toward the cost of coverage. Claims and premiums for which we are responsible are paid with our own funds.\nThe pension plan disclosures herein include information related to our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans only, unless otherwise noted. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Consolidated Balance Sheets also include a liability of $\n44\nmillion and $\n45\nmillion, respectively, in “Pension and postretirement benefit obligations” relating to our non-U.S. pension plans and certain other retirement severance plans.\nWe use a December 31 measurement date for all pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nII-82\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table sets forth the change in benefit obligation for our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nThe actuarial loss of $\n137\nmillion, included in the change in benefit obligation for pension benefits in 2023, was driven by a\n30\nbasis point decrease in the discount rate from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023.\nThe following table sets forth the change in plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nThe funded status of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nOur qualified pension plans were underfunded by $\n378\nmillion and $\n485\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nII-83\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following amounts were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n3.71\nbillion and $\n3.66\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInformation for the pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets is set forth below.\nThe following tables present the components of net periodic cost (benefit) and amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\n(a) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.\n(b) Includes amounts reflected in net earnings from discontinued operations of $\n7\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $\n3\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\n.\nThe service cost component of net periodic cost is presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within operating income. All other components of net periodic cost are presented below operating income, in “Other items, net.”\nII-84\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nN/A - not applicable\nThe discount rates are determined primarily based on the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds, providing cash flows necessary to meet the pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligations. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets.\nThe following additional assumptions were used in accounting for postretirement benefits.\nII-85\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nPlan Assets\nThe Paramount Global Investments Committee (the “Committee”) determines the strategy for the investment of pension plan assets. The Committee establishes target asset allocations for our pension plan trusts based upon an analysis of the timing and amount of projected benefit payments, projected company contributions, the expected returns and risk of the asset classes and the correlation of those returns. The target asset allocation for the Company’s domestic pension plans is to invest between\n60\n% -\n68\n% in liability hedging assets,\n22\n% -\n30\n% in equity securities,\n3\n% -\n10\n% in real estate and real assets and the remainder in cash, cash equivalents, Paramount stock and other investments. At December 31, 2023, the trusts were invested approximately\n61\n% in liability hedging assets,\n25\n% in equity securities,\n6\n% in real estate and real assets, and the remainder in cash, cash equivalents, Paramount stock and other investments. Liability hedging assets consist of a diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments that are substantially investment grade, with a duration that approximates the duration of the liabilities covered by the trust. All equity portfolios are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. equities and include large and small capitalization equities. The asset allocations are reviewed regularly.\nThe following tables set forth our pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022. These assets have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. See Note 12 for a description of the levels within this hierarchy. There are\nno\ninvestments categorized as Level 3.\nII-86\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a)  Assets categorized as Level 2 reflect investments in money market funds.\n(b)  Securities of diverse sectors and industries, substantially all investment grade.\n(c)  In accordance with FASB guidance, investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(d)  Underlying investments consist mainly of U.S. large capitalization and international equity securities.\nMoney market investments are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these investments. Investments in equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges. The fair value of investments in common collective funds and mutual funds is determined using the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the fund as a practical expedient. The NAV is determined by each fund’s trustee based upon the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, less liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding units. The fair value of U.S. treasury securities is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value of government related securities and corporate bonds is determined based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges, when available, or using valuation models which incorporate certain other observable inputs including recent trading activity for comparable securities and broker quoted prices. The fair value of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is based upon valuation models which incorporate available dealer quotes, projected cash flows and market information. The fair value of limited partnerships has been estimated using the NAV of the ownership interest. The NAV is determined using quarterly financial statements issued by the partnership which determine the value based on the fair value of the underlying investments.\nFuture Benefit Payments\nEstimated future benefit payments are as follows:\nIn 2024, we expect to make $\n13\nmillion in contributions to our qualified pension plans for minimum funding requirements under ERISA and $\n76\nmillion to our non-qualified pension plans to satisfy benefit payments due\nII-87\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nunder these plans. Also in 2024, we expect to contribute approximately $\n31\nmillion to our other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy our portion of benefit payments due under these plans.\nMultiemployer Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees including talent, writers, directors, producers and other employees, primarily in the entertainment industry. The other employers participating in these multiemployer plans are primarily in the entertainment and other related industries. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans as assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. In addition, if we choose to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan. We recognize the net periodic cost for multiemployer pension and postretirement benefit plans based on the required contributions to the plans.\nThe financial health of a multiemployer plan is indicated by the zone status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Plans in the red zone are in critical status; those in the yellow zone are in endangered status; and those in the green zone are neither critical nor endangered.\nThe table below presents information concerning our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.\n(a) The zone status for each individual plan listed was certified by each plan’s actuary as of the beginning of the plan years for 2023 and 2022. The plan year is the twelve months ending December 31 for each plan listed above except AFTRA Retirement Plan which has a plan year ending November 30.\n(b) The Company was listed in these plan’s most recent Form 5500 as providing more than\n5\n% of total contributions for the plan.\n(c) The expiration dates range from July 31, 2024 through March 2, 2025.\nAs a result of the above noted zone status there were no funding improvements or rehabilitation plans implemented, as defined by ERISA, nor any surcharges imposed for any of the individual plans listed.\nWe also contribute to multiemployer plans that provide postretirement healthcare and other benefits to certain employees under collective bargaining agreements. The contributions to these plans were $\n172\nmillion, $\n192\nmillion and $\n184\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nII-88\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe sponsor defined contribution plans for the benefit of employees meeting eligibility requirements. Employer contributions to such plans were $\n151\nmillion, $\n137\nmillion and $\n106\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n18)\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe tables below set forth our financial information by reportable segment. Our operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments, have been determined in accordance with our internal management structure, which is organized based upon products and services.\nRevenues generated between segments are principally from intersegment arrangements for the distribution of content, rental of studio space, and advertising, as well as licensing revenues earned from third parties who license our content to our internal platforms either through a sub-license or co-production arrangement. These transactions are recorded at market value as if the sales were to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation. For content that is licensed between segments, content costs are allocated across segments based on the relative value of the distribution windows within each segment. Accordingly, no intersegment licensing revenues or profits are recorded by the licensor segment.\nII-89\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nWe present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, other corporate matters, programming charges, impairment charges and gains or losses on dispositions, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting since it is the primary method used by our management. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management.\n(a) Stock-based compensation expense of $\n5\nmillion for 2023, $\n14\nmillion for 2022 and $\n20\nmillion for 2021 is included in “Restructuring and other corporate matters”.\n(a) Revenue classifications are based on customers’ locations.\nII-90\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a) Reflects total assets less current assets, investments, goodwill, intangible assets, noncurrent receivables and noncurrent deferred tax assets.\nWe do not disclose our assets by segment because they are not used to evaluate our operating performance or in determining the allocation of resources.\n19)\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments\nOur long-term commitments not recorded on the balance sheet primarily consist of programming and talent commitments and purchase obligations for goods and services resulting from our normal course of business.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur long-term programming and talent commitments not recorded on the balance sheet, estimated to aggregate to $\n31.34\nbillion as of December 31, 2023, include $\n28.56\nbillion for sports programming rights and $\n2.78\nbillion relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, including talent contracts. We also have long-term committed purchase obligations which include agreements to purchase goods or services in the future that totaled $\n1.08\nbillion as of December 31, 2023.\nThese commitments are payable as follows:\nOn-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2023, we also had long-term contractual obligations for programming liabilities, participations, and residuals, as well as a tax liability resulting from federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017, that are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The tax liability reflects the long-term portion of the tax on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS in 2025.\nThese long-term contractual obligations are payable as follows:\nWe also have long-term lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023. See Note 10 for details of our operating lease commitments.\nII-91\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nGuarantees\nLetters of Credit and Surety Bonds\nAt December 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $\n213\nmillion that were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as a $\n1.9\nbillion standby letter of credit facility, under which\nno\nletters of credit were issued. In January 2024, in accordance with the contractual requirements of one of our commitments, a $\n1.9\nbillion letter of credit was issued under this facility. The amount outstanding under the letter of credit will decrease throughout 2024 as we make payments under the related contractual commitment. Letters of credit and surety bonds are primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business under contractual requirements of certain of our commitments. The standby letter of credit facility, which matures in May 2026, is subject to the same principal financial covenant as the Credit Facility (see Note 9).\nCBS Television City\nIn connection with the sale of the CBS Television City property and sound stage operation (“CBS Television City”) in 2019, we guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first\nfive years\nfollowing the completion of the sale. Included in “Other current liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 is a liability totaling $\n26\nmillion, reflecting the present value of the remaining estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.\nLease Guarantees\nWe have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players. These lease commitments totaled $\n8\nmillion at December 31, 2023, and are presented within “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of lease commitments varies over time depending on the expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations based on our consideration of available financial information, the lessees’ historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees’ business models.\nOther\nIn the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for our indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.\nLegal Matters\nGeneral\nOn an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “Litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nII-92\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nStockholder Matters\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nBeginning in February 2020,\nthree\npurported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Chancery Court”). In March 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated the\nthree\nlawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating Engineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action captioned\nIn re CBS Corporation Stockholder Class Action and Derivative Litigation\n(the “CBS Litigation”). In April 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, National Amusements, Inc., Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, additional members of the CBS Board of Directors (including Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and the Company as nominal defendant. The Complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the negotiation and approval of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 13, 2019, between CBS and Viacom (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleged waste and unjust enrichment in connection with certain aspects of Mr. Ianniello’s compensation awards. The Complaint sought unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In December 2022, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the fiduciary duty claim against Mr. Klieger.\nIn May 2023, the parties to the CBS Litigation entered into a settlement agreement that provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the CBS Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment to the Company in the amount of $\n167.5\nmillion, less administrative costs and plaintiffs’ counsels’ fees and expenses. In September 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court approved the settlement and dismissed the CBS Litigation with prejudice. In October 2023, the Company received the settlement payment in the amount of $\n120\nmillion, which reflects the settlement of $\n167.5\nmillion after a deduction was made for administrative costs and plaintiffs’ counsels’ fees and expenses, and accordingly, we recognized a gain of $\n120\nmillion during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nBeginning in November 2019,\nfour\npurported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Delaware Chancery Court. In January 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated the\nfour\nlawsuits. In February 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. Subsequently, in February 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish (as used in this paragraph, the “Viacom Litigation”). The Complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint sought unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In December 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed. In March 2023, the parties to the Viacom Litigation entered into a settlement agreement that provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the Viacom Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment in the amount of $\n122.5\nmillion, which has been fully paid. In July 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court granted approval of the settlement and dismissed the Viacom Litigation with prejudice.\nII-93\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nLitigation Related to Stock Offerings\nIn August 2021, Camelot Event Driven Fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, and in November 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”). The Complaint is on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and\n5.75\n% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was filed against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company’s stock price. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were heard in January 2023. In February 2023, the Court dismissed all claims against the Company while allowing the claims against the underwriters to proceed. The plaintiffs and underwriter defendants have appealed the ruling.\nLitigation Related to Television Station Owners\nIn September 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning about January 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among\nfourteen\ntotal defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. We reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, was subject to Court approval. In August 2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement, and in December 2023, the Court granted final approval of the settlement.\nClaims Related to Former Businesses\nAsbestos\nWe are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.\nClaims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2023, we had pending approximately\n19,970\nasbestos claims, as compared with approximately\n21,580\nas of December 31, 2022 and\n27,770\nas of December 31, 2021. During 2023, we received approximately\n2,790\nnew claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately\n4,400\nclaims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal\nII-94\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\norder has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2023 and 2022 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $\n54\nmillion and $\n57\nmillion, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.\nFilings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. A significant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict long-term future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The reasonably estimable period for our long-term asbestos liability is\n10\nyears, which we determined in consultation with a third-party firm with expertise in estimating asbestos liability and is due to the inherent uncertainties in the tort litigation system. Our estimated asbestos liability is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, and is assessed in consultation with the third-party firm. Based on an assessment of these factors during the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the accrual for asbestos matters by $\n23\nmillion, which was recorded as a charge in “Restructuring and other corporate matters” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The increased accrual was primarily the result of a lower-than-expected rate of decline in new claims. Changes in circumstances in future periods could cause our actual liabilities to be higher or lower than our current accrual. We will continue to evaluate our estimates and update our accrual as needed.\nOther\nFrom time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods and, as a result, our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.\n20)\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following table presents the components of “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nII-95\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nOn October 31, 2022 we acquired the remaining\n40\n% interest in Nickelodeon UK Limited (“Nick UK”), bringing our ownership to\n100\n%.
