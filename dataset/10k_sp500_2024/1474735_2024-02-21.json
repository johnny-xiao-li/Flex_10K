As an energy technology solutions company that is “Powering a Smarter World”, our corporate purpose is to lead the evolution to more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy solutions around the world.\nWe have a long history of providing power generation products across a variety of applications, and we maintain one of the leading market positions in the power equipment markets in North America and an expanding presence internationally. We believe we have one of the widest ranges of products in the power generation marketplace, including residential, commercial, and industrial standby generators, as well as portable and mobile generators used in a variety of applications. In recent years, the Company has been evolving its product portfolio by building out ecosystems of energy technology products, solutions, and services for homes and businesses. As part of this evolution, we have made significant investments into growing markets such as residential and C&I energy storage, solar module-level power electronics (MLPE), energy monitoring & management devices, and electric vehicle (EV) charging. Central to these ecosystems are the Company’s next-generation connectivity devices, controls capabilities, and software platforms that facilitate the integration of our products and support the growing utilization of such distributed energy resources (DERs) in grid services programs. In addition, we have been leveraging our leading position in the growing market for natural gas fueled generators, which we believe represents a cleaner transition fuel compared to diesel, to expand into applications beyond standby power, allowing us to participate in Energy-as-a-Service and microgrid projects for C&I customers. As the traditional centralized utility model evolves over time, we believe that a more decarbonized, digitized, and decentralized grid infrastructure will develop, and Generac’s energy technology solutions are uniquely and strategically positioned to participate in this next-generation grid referred to as “Grid 2.0”.\nAs our traditional power generation markets continue to grow due to multiple mega-trends that are driving increased penetration of our products, we believe we are in an excellent position to execute on this opportunity given our competitive strengths. In addition, our focus on more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions has dramatically increased our served addressable market, and as a result, we believe that Generac is well positioned for success over the long term.\nCompany History\nGenerac was founded in 1959 to commercialize a line of affordable portable generators that offered superior performance and features. The Company’s success through the years has been built upon engineering expertise, manufacturing excellence and our innovative approaches to the market. This has driven our growth into becoming a leading provider of power equipment for a variety of applications within residential, commercial, and industrial markets.\nIn 1980, we expanded beyond portable generators into the industrial power generation market with the introduction of our first stationary generators that provided up to 200kW of power output. We introduced our first residential standby generator in 1989 and expanded our industrial product offering and global distribution system in the 1990s, forming a series of alliances that rapidly increased our sales. Our growth accelerated in the 2000s as we expanded our purpose-built line of residential and commercial automatic standby generators and implemented our multi-layered, omni-channel distribution philosophy. Throughout the 2000s, a number of high-profile power outage events also helped to increase the awareness and need for backup power and home standby generators. In 2006, the founder of Generac sold the company to affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC, together with certain other investors and members of our management. In February 2010, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of the Company’s common stock. Since then, we have scaled our sales & marketing capabilities and systems, while also building the Generac brand into one of the leading names in backup power around the nation.\nSoon after going public, we implemented our “Powering Ahead” enterprise strategy. This strategic plan accelerated the Company’s transition from primarily a North America focused, emergency backup generator company into a more diversified industrial technology company with the addition of new and adjacent product categories and an expanded global presence, primarily through a series of acquisitions. In 2018, we transitioned to a new enterprise strategy called “Powering Our Future”, which drove further share gains in new and existing markets, capitalized on Generac’s leadership in natural gas gensets, established our connectivity strategy, and provided the foundation for the Company’s evolution into an energy technology solutions company, including our initial acquisitions within the residential clean energy space. This ultimately led to the introduction of our “Powering A Smarter World” enterprise strategy in 2021. Our current strategic plan continues the evolution of Generac’s business model that pairs traditional and emerging power generation, conversion, and storage technologies with new monitoring, management and grid services capabilities to provide solutions for the dynamic challenges presented by today’s energy landscape.\n2\nSignificant Investments in Energy Technology Solutions\nWe’ve been providing power generation and resiliency solutions for homes and businesses for decades. Leveraging that expertise in power generation, Generac has made significant investments in recent years to expand its capabilities into energy technology solutions, beginning with the March 2019 acquisition of Neurio Technology Inc., a leading energy data company focused on monitoring technology and sophisticated analytics to optimize energy use within a home or business. This was followed by the April 2019 acquisition of Pika Energy Inc. (Pika Energy), a designer and manufacturer of battery storage technologies that capture and store solar or other power sources for homeowners and businesses. In October 2020, the Company acquired Enbala Power Networks Inc., one of the leading providers of distributed energy optimization and control software that helps support the operational stability of the world’s power grids. In July 2021, Generac added to its residential clean energy portfolio with the acquisition of Chilicon Power LLC (Chilicon), a designer and provider of grid-interactive rooftop power inversion devices and monitoring solutions for the solar market. With these acquisitions, Generac has established a presence in the rapidly developing residential clean energy market, focused on solar and battery storage solutions, as well as grid services platforms that can leverage any of our product offerings that are capable of being grid-connected.\nIn December 2021, Generac acquired ecobee Inc. (ecobee), a leader in sustainable home technology solutions. In addition to smart home thermostatic controls and other smart home devices, ecobee offers its customers the ability to participate in energy services programs, which allow homeowners to reduce energy consumption and utility bills via intelligent HVAC controls. The acquisition represents a major step forward in the Company’s efforts to provide an integrated residential energy ecosystem that includes a sophisticated user interface platform to allow homeowners to take charge of their energy generation, storage, consumption, and management. We believe ecobee’s solutions, serving as the central hub of our residential energy ecosystem, together with its product and software development expertise will prove to be a differentiator for Generac when combined with our growing suite of energy technology solutions.\nIn December 2023, Generac made a minority investment in Wallbox N.V. (Wallbox) (NYSE: WBX), a global leader in smart EV charging and energy management solutions. Along with the investment, Generac and Wallbox are expected to collaborate to provide Wallbox’s full suite of EV charging solutions to Generac’s customers and distribution partners. Also in 2023, we opened a dedicated engineering center of excellence in Reno, Nevada that will house the development and testing of batteries, switches, power electronics, and other clean energy solutions.\nAs we look to the future, we expect to make continued investment in the people, processes, and capabilities involved in the development of these residential energy technologies, as we work to further broaden our product offering and distribution network. Additionally, the favorable policy backdrop for these markets, underscored by the Inflation Reduction Act and other state regulations, provides the necessary visibility to drive potential long-term, value-creating investments. With this opportunity in front of us, we plan to build out our residential energy technology capabilities and our suite of products and solutions as we expect to play an important role in the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable, and more reliable electric grid.\nGenerac’s efforts in expanding its energy technology solutions cover C&I and international markets as well. In June 2021, the Company acquired Deep Sea Electronics Limited, a UK-based designer and manufacturer of advanced controls for a range of power generation and other applications used around the world. In September 2021, Generac acquired Off Grid Energy Ltd., a designer and manufacturer of industrial-grade mobile energy storage systems serving predominantly rental markets. The Company advanced its C&I connectivity strategy with the October 2022 acquisition of Blue Pillar, an industrial internet of things (IoT) platform developer that designs, deploys, and manages industrial IoT solutions. Blue Pillar provides a foundation to build out a connectivity solution for our C&I products to further enable their use in grid services programs. In February 2023, Generac acquired REFU Storage Systems GmbH (REFU), a developer and supplier of battery storage and inverter hardware products, advanced software, and platform services for the commercial and industrial markets. REFU’s energy storage systems will complement and enhance our current global product offerings and is expected to further accelerate our development of new technologies as we continue to provide our commercial and industrial consumers with leading solutions for their adoption of renewable energy. Additionally, in 2023 Generac launched a series of stationary battery energy storage systems for commercial and industrial applications in the North American market that will help us advance our capabilities in microgrid projects. These acquisitions and related organic initiatives will collectively help lay the groundwork to further advance our energy technology strategies across C&I markets around the world.\nFor a complete summary of recent acquisitions, please see Note 1, “Description of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProducts and Solutions\nWe design, manufacture, and distribute a broad range of energy technology products and solutions. We design and manufacture stationary, portable, and mobile power generators with single-engine outputs ranging between 800W and 3,250kW. We have developed a line of energy storage systems for use in residential solar-plus-storage applications. We also have a line of stationary and mobile energy storage systems that serve global commercial and industrial markets. We have a growing selection of energy monitoring and management devices and solutions that we expect to serve as the central hub or controls platform for our residential and C&I energy ecosystems. We participate in the market for grid services by providing distributed energy optimization and control software. We design and manufacture other power products including light towers and a broad line of outdoor power equipment that we refer to as “chore products”, which includes a variety of property maintenance equipment powered by both engines and batteries. We classify our products into three categories based on similar ranges of power output geared for varying end customer uses: Residential products, C&I products, and \"Other products and services\". The following summary outlines these categories, including their key attributes and customer applications.\nResidential Products\nOur residential automatic standby generators range in output from 7.5kW to 150kW, which predominantly operate on natural gas and liquid propane, and are permanently installed with an automatic transfer switch, which we also manufacture. Air-cooled engine residential standby generators range in outputs from 7.5kW to 26kW and serve as an emergency backup for small to medium-sized homes. Liquid-cooled engine generators serve as emergency backup for larger homes and small businesses and range in output from 22kW to 150kW.\n3\nAs the product category leader, we believe we have the broadest line of home standby generators in the marketplace. Every home standby generator that we offer is equipped with Mobile Link™. This remote monitoring capability is a standard, WiFi-enabled feature that allows our customers to check the status of their generator remotely from their smart phone or tablet, and also provides the capability to similarly receive maintenance and service alerts. The data that is provided by this remote monitoring functionality allows us to better understand our installed base of products, while optimizing both product quality and customer satisfaction. In 2021, we expanded our residential connectivity strategy with the acquisition of Tank Utility Inc. (Tank Utility), an IoT propane tank monitoring solutions company. This addition provides incremental value to our dealers and peace of mind to owners of our home standby generators that use propane as a fuel source.\nLeveraging the technologies acquired in the 2019 acquisition of Pika Energy, we have developed a line of clean energy products marketed under the Generac brand and using the PWRcell™ brand name. This residential storage solution consists of a system of batteries, an inverter, photovoltaic (PV) optimizers, power electronic controls, and other components. This system captures and stores electricity from solar panels or other power sources and helps reduce home energy costs while also protecting homes from shorter duration power outages. PWRcell systems can range in size from 9kWh up to 36kWh of storage capacity. In 2022, we launched PWRmanager, the second generation of our load management controls, allowing customers to program and remotely control certain loads in a home and thereby manage battery run times from their smart phones or tablets.\nIn 2021, we acquired ecobee, a leader in sustainable smart home solutions such as smart thermostats and a suite of home monitoring products, all designed with a focus on energy conservation, convenience, peace of mind and comfort. ecobee’s smart home energy management devices and complementary sensors intelligently optimize heating and cooling systems, often the largest energy consuming system within a home, to deliver significant energy savings for homeowners. In 2023, ecobee launched a line of smart doorbell cameras, which integrates with ecobee’s products and helps to drive increased consumer engagement with their platform. The capabilities acquired via ecobee and Tank Utility, paired with our existing Mobile Link remote monitoring system, provide the foundation for Generac’s residential connectivity strategy, which will be integral in the continued development of our smart home energy ecosystem.\nImportantly, we are leveraging ecobee’s technologies and software development expertise to develop a user interface platform at the center of our home energy ecosystem that will allow homeowners to monitor and control Generac’s entire suite of products using a “single pane of glass”. In 2023, we took our first steps towards this goal by successfully integrating our home standby generators and propane tank monitors with the ecobee platform. We believe the integration of our products and solutions in a single cohesive ecosystem will drive additional peace of mind and energy efficiency benefits for homeowners.\nThis functionality will also help enable connection to our grid services distributed energy resource management software (DERMS) called Concerto. All of our residential energy technology products and home standby generators come with grid-connection capabilities, enabling consumers to connect and enroll their distributed energy resources in available grid services programs. These solutions can provide material value to homeowners in the form of lower utility costs, while also helping grid operators retain capacity to address supply/demand imbalances on the grid.\nWe continue to develop new Generac-branded energy technology products that we expect to bring to market as we build out a broader energy management ecosystem, giving our distributors access to a more diverse line-up of products that can serve a variety of applications. For example, our recent investment in Wallbox is expected to allow us to participate in the rapidly developing home EV charging market by offering co-branded EV charging technologies through our expansive distribution network.\nWe also provide a broad product line of portable and inverter generators that range in size from 800W to 18kW, as well as multiple portable battery solutions that provide clean, emission-free power at the push of a button. These products can help serve as an emergency home backup source of electricity and are also used for construction and recreational purposes. Our portable generators are targeted at homeowners, with price points ranging between the consumer value end of the market through the premium homeowner market; at professional contractors, starting at the value end through the premium contractor segment; and at the recreational market with our inverter generator products, which are quieter than traditional portable generators. In addition, we offer manual transfer switches to supplement our portable generator product offering.\nWe provide a broad product line of outdoor power equipment referred to as “chore products”, which are used in property maintenance applications for larger-acreage residences, commercial properties, municipalities, and farms. These products include trimmers, field and brush mowers, log splitters, stump grinders, chipper shredders, lawn and leaf vacuums, pressure washers and water pumps. We also offer commercial-grade, battery-powered turf care products through Mean Green Products, which was acquired in 2020. In addition to Generac’s efforts to expand Mean Green’s production capacity and distribution capabilities, this acquisition will help to accelerate the electrification of our higher-powered lineup of chore products. Chore products are largely sold in North America through direct-to-consumer online catalogs, retail hardware stores, and outdoor power equipment dealers, primarily under the DR® brand name.\nResidential products comprised\n51.3%,\n63.8% and 65.8%, respectively, of total net sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n4\nCommercial & Industrial\nP\nroducts\nWe offer a full line of C&I generators that are sold around the world. We are a leader in cleaner-burning natural gas fueled generators, and also have a full offering of C&I generators that are fueled by diesel and Bi-Fuel\nTM\n. We believe we have one of the broadest product offerings in the industry with power outputs ranging from 10kW up to 3,250kW. Through the Deep Sea acquisition in 2021, we have expanded our capabilities in the design and manufacture of advanced controls for a range of C&I power generation applications, such as microgrids and “beyond standby” configurations. Our natural gas C&I stationary generators have grid-connection capabilities, enabling our customers to generate an incremental return on investment by connecting and enrolling their generator as a distributed energy resource in grid services applications where available.\nOur light-commercial standby generators and related transfer switches include a full range of affordable systems from 22kW to 150kW, providing three-phase power sufficient for most small and mid-sized businesses such as grocery stores, convenience stores, restaurants, gas stations, pharmacies, retail banks, small health care facilities and other small-footprint retail applications. Our light-commercial generators predominantly run on natural gas and liquid propane.\nWe design and manufacture a broad product line of modularized and configured stationary generators and related transfer switches for various industrial standby, continuous-duty, and prime rated applications. Our single-engine industrial generators range in output from 10kW up to 3,250kW, include stationary and containerized packages, and can include our Modular Power Systems (MPS) technology that extends our product range up to much larger multi-megawatt systems through an integrated paralleling configuration. Over the past several years, we have introduced larger and higher-powered gaseous-fueled generators, with the highest output of 1,000kW for a single-engine set. Our industrial standby generators are primarily used as emergency backup for larger applications (such as healthcare, telecom, datacom, commercial office, retail, municipal and manufacturing markets, to name a few). In recent years, we've focused our efforts to utilize our gaseous-fueled generators in \"beyond standby\" applications including distributed generation and microgrid projects and have developed purpose-built products for these applications that have grid-connected capability. This grid-connected functionality and the significant expansion of our in-house advanced controls capabilities further enhances the potential utilization of our generators in these applications.\nOur MPS technology combines the power of several smaller generators to produce the output of a larger generator, providing our customers with redundancy and scalability in a cost-effective manner. For larger industrial applications, our MPS products offer customers an efficient, affordable way to scale their standby power needs, while offering superior reliability given their built-in redundancy which allows individual units to be taken off-line for routine maintenance while retaining coverage for critical circuits.\nWe also offer a full line of industrial transfer switches to meet varying needs from light commercial applications all the way up to the most demanding mission-critical installations. In recent years, we have significantly increased and upgraded our industrial transfer switch product offering, which we believe will help to enhance our attachment rate and related market share for these products. Generac’s innovative feature set and flexible platforms offer a variety of switching configurations to meet almost any project needs.\nWe also design and manufacture a broad product line of C&I mobile products such as light towers and mobile generators, which provide temporary lighting and power for various end markets around the world (such as road and commercial construction, energy, mining, military, and special events). We also offer commercial mobile pumps, heaters, and dust-suppression equipment for a wide variety of applications. All of our mobile products are typically sold to national and regional rental companies who then rent the equipment to the end user.\nWe have continued to expand our portfolio of energy technology solutions for C&I applications. In 2021, we acquired Off Grid Energy, a European based manufacturer of mobile energy storage systems predominantly used in the rental markets. In 2023, we acquired REFU, a European based provider of stationary energy storage systems and related inverter products. We also organically introduced a line of larger stationary battery energy storage systems for C&I applications in the North American market. We believe these collective product offerings will enable us to capture market share of the rapidly expanding Battery Energy Storage System (or BESS) market in the future. Our BESS solutions are primarily targeted at “behind-the-meter” applications for on-site energy storage. We expect to leverage our leading position as a provider of traditional stationary generators to gain share in the global BESS market. This expertise is particularly beneficial for multi-asset solutions that combine generators with energy storage assets, providing the many benefits of behind-the-meter storage with longer duration outage protection. We also continue to develop other energy technology products, such as mobile battery-powered light towers, as well as hybrid mobile solutions that pair a battery with a diesel engine to reduce emissions and noise pollution. In addition, we continue to provide various gaseous-engine control systems and accessories, which are used in our natural gas generators, as well as sold to other gas-engine manufacturers and aftermarket customers.\nC&I products comprise\nd 37.2%,\n27.6% and 26.7%, respectively, of total net sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n5\nOther\nP\nroducts\nand Services\nOur “Other products and services” category primarily consists of aftermarket service parts and product accessories sold to our customers, installation and maintenance services, extended warranty revenue, grid services revenue, remote monitoring subscription revenue, and other service offerings provided by our owned industrial distributors.\nIncluded in this “Other products and services” category are energy services revenues that are generated by ecobee, Blue Pillar, and our Concerto software platform. The Concerto energy-balancing software platform provides a highly flexible approach for controlling and dispatching distributed energy resources from flexible loads, backup generators, energy storage systems, and other renewable energy sources, and gives utilities and grid operators the flexibility to operate virtual power plants in real-time to better manage the escalating complexities of the future electrical grid. These capabilities are broadly referred to as grid services.\nThe acquisition of ecobee further enhanced our efforts in grid services. In addition to their product sales, ecobee also recognizes service revenue in certain circumstances when a homeowner enrolls their smart thermostat in a grid services program offered by their utility. ecobee can provide utilities direct connection to a homeowner’s smart thermostat, thereby allowing control of a significant portion of the home’s electrical load. In exchange for this capability, utilities pay ecobee for that connection.\nThe 2022 acquisition of Blue Pillar expanded our C&I connectivity capabilities and provided a standard protocol for all of our C&I products to be connected to our Concerto platform. In addition to connectivity device sales, Blue Pillar recognizes software subscription and support revenue resulting from the monitoring and management capabilities its platform provides customers.\nFinally, our Mobile Link platform provides remote monitoring services for our residential home standby customers and “Fleet” services for our residential home standby dealers, whereby we collect subscription revenue for these services on a recurring basis.\n\"Other products and services\" compr\nised 11.5%, 8\n.6% and 7.5%, respectively, of total net sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nMega-Trends, Strategic Growth Themes, and Additional Business Drivers\nIn 2021, we unveiled our “Powering A Smarter World” strategic plan, which serves as the framework for the significant investments we have made and will continue to make to capitalize on the long-term growth prospects of Generac. Our enterprise strategy is based on the combination of several key mega-trends that we believe will drive several significant strategic growth themes for our business.\nKey Mega-Trends:\nStrategic Growth Themes:\nPower quality issues continue to increase\n. Power disruptions are an important driver of consumer awareness for back-up power and have historically influenced demand for generators both in the United States and internationally. Increased frequency and duration of major power outage events, that have a broader impact beyond a localized level, increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period, which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major outage event. Energy storage systems offer similar resiliency advantages to consumers and can benefit from these same awareness drivers, at least for short duration power outages. The optional standby market for C&I power generation is also driven by power quality issues and the related need for backup power. Attitudes around climate change have shifted and undergone increased global focus in recent years, and an aging and underinvested electrical grid infrastructure remains highly vulnerable to the expectation of more severe and volatile weather. Additionally, rapid growth in renewable power sources such as solar and wind is resulting in increased intermittency of supply, further impairing the reliable supply of electricity at a time when demand is starting to increase meaningfully with the electrification of a wide range of consumer and commercial products, including transportation, HVAC systems, and other major appliances. These developments are causing a growing supply/demand imbalance for grid operators across North America, which has led to high-profile examples of rolling blackouts and calls for utility customers to reduce consumption to maintain grid integrity. In fact, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation has labeled significant portions of the United States and Canada as being at high risk of resource adequacy shortfalls during normal seasonal peak conditions in the 2024-2028 period due in part to these supply/demand dynamics. We are seeing increasing evidence that warnings of potential resource inadequacies are driving incremental consumer awareness of the need for backup power solutions. We believe utility supply shortfalls and related warnings may continue in the future, further expanding awareness of deteriorating power quality in North America. Taken together, we expect these factors to continue driving increased awareness of the need for backup power and demand for Generac’s products within multiple categories.\n6\nHome standby penetration opportunity is significant\n. Many potential customers are still not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions. With only approximately 6.25\n%\npenetration of the addressable market of homes in the United States (which we define as single-family detached, owner-occupied households with a home value of over $150,000, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 American Housing Survey for the United States), we believe there are significant opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market both domestically and internationally. We believe by expanding our distribution network, continuing to develop our product lines, and targeting our marketing efforts, we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our home standby generators.\nSolar, storage, and energy management markets are developing quickly\n. We believe the electric utility landscape will undergo significant changes in the decade ahead due to rising utility rates, grid instability and power quality issues, environmental concerns, and the continuing performance and cost improvements in renewable energy and energy storage technologies. On-site power generation from renewable sources and cleaner-burning natural gas generators are projected to become more prevalent as will the need to monitor, manage, and store this power – potentially developing into a significant market opportunity. Additionally, these markets are receiving an increasing level of regulatory and legislative support, most notably from the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed in 2022. This legislation includes significant subsidies and investment tax credits for consumers and businesses over the coming decade, as well as production tax credits for businesses that meet certain domestic manufacturing requirements in the production of renewable energy products. We believe this legislative support will provide necessary opportunity for long-term, value-creating investments for market participants in this space. We expect to further advance our capabilities in energy technology by increasing our product development, sourcing, distribution, and marketing efforts. In addition, we should be able to leverage our significant competencies in the residential standby generator market to build our market position in the emerging residential solar, storage, and energy management markets.\nEnergy-as-a-Service models,\n“\nbeyond standby\n”\napplications, and energy services open new market opportunities\n. We expect the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model toward decarbonized, digitized, and decentralized solutions will continue to drive the need for grid operators to access and control DERs. This will require highly intelligent software platforms that are able to optimize an increasingly complex supply and demand equation, such as our Concerto DERMS software platform. Additionally, growing interest in our C&I products across a variety of “beyond standby” applications is driving an increase in demand for subscription-like models for end customers, in which Generac will partner with third parties to deliver resiliency solutions that are also able to contribute to grid stability with minimal upfront capital outlays. We also believe that we can gain share in the C&I “behind the meter” energy storage market, including microgrid applications that require advanced system-level controls. The significant advancements made in recent years in the connectivity of our products are core to these newer capabilities, which play a key role in the evolution of Generac into an energy technology solutions company.\nNatural gas generators, a continuing growth opportunity\n. We believe natural gas will continue to be an important and cleaner transition fuel of the future, in comparison to diesel, as the world continues to shift towards lower emission power generation sources. Demand for natural gas generators continues to represent an increasing portion of the overall C&I market, which we believe will continue to grow at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators. We also continue to explore and expand our capabilities within new gaseous generator market opportunities, including continuous-duty, prime rated, distributed generation, demand response, microgrids, and overall use as a distributed energy resource in areas where grid stability is needed. Many of these applications are made possible by our natural gas generators having the capability to participate in available grid services programs, helping to offset the purchase price of the equipment over the product’s lifespan. Expanding our natural gas product offering into larger power nodes is also a part of this growth theme in taking advantage of the continuing shift from diesel to natural gas generators.\nIncreasingly critical nature and growing power consumption of digital infrastructure\n. As the number of “connected” devices continues to rapidly increase and wireless networks are considered critical infrastructure in the United States, network reliability and up-time are necessary for our increasingly connected society. This will require highly resilient cell tower sites across the network, and therefore necessitates the need for backup power sources on site at these cell towers. Generac is the leading supplier of backup power to the telecommunications market in the United States, where approximately half of all existing tower sites have yet to be hardened with backup power. As more mission-critical data is transmitted over wireless networks, we believe this penetration rate must increase considerably to maintain a higher level of reliability across the network. We have relationships with key Tier 1 carriers and tower companies globally, in addition to having the distribution partners to provide service support to the global market. We believe these factors coupled with Generac’s ability to customize solutions to each customer’s needs help us to maintain our strength within the global telecommunications market.\nAdditionally, the rapid increase in data centers is driving increased demand for backup power solutions, given the critical nature of this infrastructure. AI requirements, hyperscalers, and the expansion of edge computing and “connected devices” are expected to double data center power consumption from 2022 to 2030. We believe this significant growth in power consumption, as well as the increasing dependency of society on this next-generation digital infrastructure, will drive demand for backup power and intelligent energy management solutions, both at the individual site level and for the broader electrical grid.\n7\nOther Business Drivers\nImpact of residential investment cycle.\nThe market for a number of our residential products is affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment. When homeowners are confident of their household income, the value of their home and overall net worth, they are more likely to invest in their home. These trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators, energy storage systems, and energy management devices. Trends in the new housing market, highlighted by residential housing starts, can also impact demand for these products. Demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors, as well as weather patterns. The existence of renewable energy mandates, investment tax credits and other subsidies, which have become even more prevalent with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act, can also have an impact on the demand for solar and energy storage systems.\nImpact of business capital investment and other economic cycles.\nThe global market for our C&I products is affected by different capital investment cycles, which can vary widely across the different regions and markets that we serve. These cycles include non-residential building construction, durable goods and infrastructure spending, as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil & gas, as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment. These trends and market conditions can have a material impact on demand for our products. The capital investment cycle may differ for the various C&I end markets that we serve, including light commercial, retail, office, telecommunications, rental, industrial, data centers, healthcare, construction, oil & gas and municipal infrastructure, among others. The market for these products is also affected by general economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, and geopolitical matters in the various countries where we serve, as well as credit availability in those regions.\nEnterprise Strategy\nThe mega-trends and strategic growth themes that we have identified support our enterprise strategy, “Powering A Smarter World,” and our purpose statement, “To lead the evolution to more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy solutions.” As we continue to execute our strategic plan into the future, we are focused on three key objectives: (i) improve energy resilience and independence, (ii) optimize energy efficiency and consumption, and (iii) protect and build critical infrastructure. These objectives are further explained as follows:\nImprove energy resilience and independence.\nIncrease power reliability through onsite generation and storage solutions that provide resiliency for homes, businesses and communities.\nHomes, businesses, and communities are experiencing a deterioration in the reliable supply of electricity due to a number of factors including: climate change impacts driving more severe and volatile weather leading to increased power outages; a capacity constrained legacy power infrastructure that’s still predominantly a one-way system and remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels; the power infrastructure being impaired by underinvestment making it more susceptible to power outages; and regulatory and legislative actions implementing penalties for carbon intensity coupled with incentives for adoption of more intermittent renewable power sources. Our residential and C&I product offering begins with power generation and storage products including home standby generators, energy storage systems, and C&I generators. These onsite generation and storage solutions provide peace of mind and protection against rising power quality issues by delivering energy resilience and independence for end users and their communities. Many of these onsite solutions are capable of being connected to the grid and can help support overall grid reliability, resiliency and sustainability.\n8\nOptimize energy efficiency and consumption.\nEnable sustainable and more efficient power generation and consumption through monitoring, management and lower-carbon solutions.\nThe “electrification of everything” is expected to drive increasing demand for electricity over the next several years; including the electrification of transportation, via both electric vehicle adoption and expanding charging infrastructure; the electrification of the home, including HVAC systems and other appliances; and the electrification of commercial and industrial systems. These global electrification trends will require utilities and energy retailers to meaningfully increase the supply and reliability of electricity, while at the same time working to achieve carbon-reduction goals, which is expected to further contribute to a supply/demand imbalance and additional power quality issues. As part of our expanding ecosystems of energy technology solutions, we continue to build out our residential monitoring and management capabilities, which improve energy efficiency and optimize consumption by end users. This includes ecobee’s smart home energy management devices, Tank Utility’s propane tank monitoring solutions, and PWRmanager, our second-generation load control device. We expect to further simplify and integrate our residential product offering into a single ecosystem, leveraging our software development capabilities brought by the ecobee acquisition. This singular system-level platform is intended to serve as the central hub and user interface for consumers to monitor and manage all their DERs, thereby empowering the user to optimize energy efficiency and consumption. Within our global C&I products, we are developing a similar ecosystem of controls that are building off Deep Sea’s system-level controls and Blue Pillar’s industrial IoT network solutions, helping businesses to better optimize their energy efficiency and consumption. These enhanced connectivity capabilities provide the foundation for the continued build out of a centralized system-level platform for our C&I customers to monitor and control all their DERs, including non-Generac assets.\nProtect and build critical infrastructure.\nOffering innovative solutions that enable and protect next-generation power, communications, transportation, and other critical infrastructure.\nThe critical power infrastructure around the world is becoming more sensitive to the growing electricity supply/demand imbalance. Generac’s suite of products can be connected and synchronized within the Concerto distributed energy resource management system, providing utilities and grid operators the flexibility to access and control these DERs in real-time to better manage the escalating complexities of their electrical grids. When utilized in these applications, our residential and C&I products essentially provide power capacity to utilities and grid operators in the form of a virtual power plant. We believe the next generation of critical power infrastructure will be more decarbonized, digitized and decentralized, and we view the aggregation and management of distributed energy resources as an important aspect in creating the future “Grid 2.0”.\nAdditionally, the growing power demands and increasingly critical nature of data centers and 5G telecom networks globally makes backup power solutions essential elements for creating resilient next-generation infrastructure. Finally, our broad offering of C&I mobile products (including mobile light towers, mobile power generators, mobile energy storage systems and hybrid generators) play a key role in the completion of infrastructure construction projects, such as roads, highways, bridges, and airports.\nSee “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business Drivers and Operational Factors” for additional drivers that influence demand for our products and other factors affecting the markets that we serve.\nDistribution Channels and C\nustomers\nWe distribute our products through a variety of different distribution channels to increase awareness of our product categories and brands, and to ensure our products reach a broad, global customer base. This omni-channel distribution network includes independent residential dealers, industrial distributors and dealers, national and regional retailers, e-commerce partners, electrical/HVAC/solar wholesalers, solar installers, catalogs, equipment rental companies, and other equipment distributors. We also sell direct to certain national and regional account customers, as well as to individual consumers or businesses who are the end users of our products.\nWe believe our global distribution network is a competitive advantage that has strengthened over the years as a result of adding, expanding and developing the various distribution channels through which we sell our products. We offer a broad set of tools, programs, factory support, and sales leads to help our distribution partners be successful. Our network is well balanced with no single customer providing more than\n4% of ou\nr sales in 2023.\nWe have the industry's largest network of factory direct independent generator dealers in North America. Our residential dealer network is made up of electrical and HVAC contractors across the US and Canada. These dealers sell, install and service our residential and light commercial generators to end users. Over the years, we have made significant investments to grow this dealer network, and we will continue to make those investments in the future given the importance of this channel. We continue to focus on a variety of initiatives to more effectively market and sell our home standby products and better align our dealer network with Generac. These initiatives have helped to improve customer lead quality and develop our dealers, thereby increasing close rates and lowering our cost per lead over time. Over the years, we have made significant investments in our “Power Play” guided sales process for residential dealers, making enhancements in several areas targeted to improve the customer experience and overall close rates. Additionally, our remote monitoring platform allows our residential generator dealers to monitor their installed base of customers through a feature that we call “Fleet”, enabling them to offer a more proactive experience to service a customer’s generator.\n9\nIn recent years, we have been establishing our base of solar contractors that sell, install and service our PWRcell energy storage systems. Leveraging our decades of expertise in partnering with our residential generator dealers, we believe we can expand our solar installer network and increase mindshare for Generac’s products, helping us to win in the clean energy market. In addition, we have been developing distribution relationships with national solar providers to offer our equipment in their portfolio of products and services. As we continue to roll-out new clean energy products in the future, we expect to accelerate our efforts to expand distribution for these products.\nOur industrial distribution network consists of industrial power generation distributors that cover particular regions around the world. Over the past several years, we have been strengthening our dealer network globally through acquisitions and organic means, to increase our C&I product sales and related market share. Additionally, since 2020, we have acquired our industrial distributors in northern and southern California and New England to give us direct coverage of the west coast and northeast regions of the United States and accelerate our efforts in these markets. Industrial distributors and dealers provide C&I end users with ongoing sales, installation, service and product support. Our industrial distributors and dealers help maintain the local relationships with commercial electrical contractors, specifying engineers, and national account regional buying offices. We also sell to certain Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies and other companies that specialize in managing more complex power generation projects, including microgrids and “beyond standby” applications.\nOur retail distribution channel includes thousands of locations across the globe and includes a variety of regional and national home improvement chains, electronics retailers, clubs, buying groups, hardware stores and farm supply stores. These physical retail locations are supplemented by a large presence of e-commerce retailers, along with a number of catalog retailers. The retail channel primarily sells our residential standby, portable and light-commercial generators, as well as our outdoor power equipment and ecobee smart home energy management devices. The placement of our products at retail locations drives significant awareness for our brands and the automatic home standby generator product category.\nOur wholesaler network distributes our residential and light-commercial generators, energy storage systems, and smart home energy management devices. The channel consists of selling branches of both national and local distribution houses for electrical, HVAC and solar products on a wholesale basis, which in turn typically sell to electricians and HVAC/solar installers who are not in our dealer network.\nOn a selective basis, we have established private label and licensing arrangements with third party partners to provide residential, light-commercial and industrial generators under different brand names. These partners include leading home equipment, electrical equipment and construction machinery companies, each of which provides access to incremental channels of distribution for our products.\nThe distribution for our C&I mobile products includes international, national, regional and specialty equipment rental companies, equipment distributors, and construction companies which primarily serve non-residential building construction, road construction, energy markets and special events.\nWe also sell direct to certain customers that are the end users of our products covering a number of end market verticals both domestically and around the world. This includes telecommunication, retail, banking, energy, utilities, healthcare, convenience stores, grocery stores, restaurants, governments, and other commercial applications. Additionally, certain of our residential products are sold direct to individual consumers, who are the end users of the product. In the grid services space, we sell software and equipment direct to utilities and grid operators.\nResearch and D\nevelopment\nOur focus on a broad range of energy technology products and solutions drives technological innovation, advanced engineering capabilities, and specialized manufacturing competencies. Research and development (R&D) has been a core competency for Generac since our inception, and today includes a staff of over 1,000 engineers working on numerous projects at various facilities around the world, including our technology centers located in Wisconsin, Nevada, Massachusetts, Suzhou, China, and Mexico City, Mexico. These activities are focused on developing new technologies and product enhancements, as well as maintaining product competitiveness by reducing manufacturing costs, improving safety characteristics, reliability and performance, while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. We have significant experience using natural gas engines and have developed specific expertise with fuel systems and emissions technology. In the residential and light commercial markets, we have developed proprietary engines, cooling packages, controls, fuel systems and emissions systems.\nWe have made several acquisitions in recent years that significantly enhanced our R&D capabilities. This includes substantial technical resources in energy storage, monitoring, and power conversion for residential applications, as well as in the C&I energy storage and generator controls spaces. These resources add proficiency in power electronics and battery management software, and we have also added considerable expertise in designing and prototyping energy efficiency products. We have significantly increased our software development capabilities across a variety of applications, including system-level controls, remote monitoring, and distributed energy resource management systems. Combining advanced software development with the expansion of our electrical engineering resources is expected to accelerate our energy technology efforts.\nWe also have engineering and product management resources focused on evaluating and developing alternative technologies that are emerging and could become commercially viable over the long term such as fuel cells and hydrogen. As we continue to evaluate new technologies that are more decarbonized, digitized, and decentralized, we believe that our expertise in energy technology solutions provides us with the capability to develop new products and services that will allow continued diversification and differentiation in our end markets.\n10\nI\nntellectual P\nroperty\nWe are committed to research and development, and we rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to help establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our patents protect certain features and technologies we have developed for use in our products including fuel systems, air flow, electronics and controls, noise reduction, air-cooled engines, energy management, energy monitoring, energy storage, and load management. We believe the existence of these patents and trademarks, along with our ongoing processes to register additional patents and trademarks, help protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our brands and competitive position. We also use proprietary manufacturing processes that require customized equipment. With our continuous focus on research and development, we expect to develop new intellectual property on an ongoing basis.\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional factors related to intellectual property rights that can affect our business.\nManufacturing\nWe operate numerous manufacturing plants, distribution facilities and inventory warehouses located throughout the world. We store finished goods at third-party logistics providers in the United States that accommodate material storage and rapid response requirements of our customers. See “Item 2 – Properties” for additional details regarding the locations and activities of our principal operations.\nIn recent years, we have added and continue to add manufacturing capacity through investments in automation, improved utilization, and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint through organic means as well as through acquisitions. In 2023, we announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin that will expand our production capacity and increase our vertical integration capabilities for certain C&I product lines. Our ability to increase capacity has been critical to executing our strategic growth priorities. We believe our vertical integration and scale in home standby generators provides a material benefit in our ability to maintain industry-leading output with state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, especially when demand for our products can increase rapidly with very short notice.\nSuppliers of Raw M\naterials, Components and Equipment\nOur primary raw material inputs are steel, copper and aluminum, all of which are purchased from third parties and, in many cases, as part of machined or manufactured components. In certain instances, we purchase complete equipment or systems from third-party suppliers, including from contract manufacturers. Given our increasing focus on energy technology solutions, advanced electronic components and micro-processors have become a larger consideration within our supply chain. Within the clean energy market, batteries are a significant supply chain input for our energy storage systems. Over multiple decades, we have developed an extensive network of reliable suppliers in the United States and around the world. We continuously evaluate the quality and cost structure of our purchased components and equipment and assess the capabilities of our supply chain. Components and equipment are sourced accordingly based on this evaluation. For certain products, we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build these products or supply these components, including but not limited to certain energy technology products or components.\nSee “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information regarding the impact of other macroeconomic factors.\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional factors that can influence our supply of raw materials, components and equipment.\nCompetition\nThe market for power generation equipment, energy storage systems, energy management solutions, and other engine powered products is competitive. We face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers, along with mobile equipment, engine powered tools, solar inverter, battery storage, smart thermostat, and grid services providers, both domestic and internationally.\nSpecifically in the generator market, most of the traditional participants compete on a more focused basis, targeting specific applications within their larger diversified product mix. We are the only significant market participant with a primary focus on power equipment with a key emphasis on standby, portable and mobile generators with broad capabilities across the residential, light-commercial and industrial markets. We believe that our engineering capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enable us to maintain a competitive advantage for product innovation. We also believe our broad product offering, diverse omni-channel distribution model and strong factory support provide additional advantages as well.\nThe Company in recent years has been evolving its business model toward more of a focus on energy technology solutions and services, which has introduced a new set of competitors.\n11\nA summary of the primary competitors across our main product classes is as follows:\nResidential products\n–\nKohler, Briggs & Stratton, Cummins, Honda, Champion, Techtronics International, Husqvarna, Ariens, LG Chem, Tesla, Enphase, Solar Edge, Google, Resideo, and Emerson along with a number of other domestic and foreign competitors; certain of which also have broad operations in other manufacturing businesses.\nC&I products\n– Caterpillar, Cummins, Kohler, IGSA, AKSA, MultiQuip, Wacker, Doosan, Atlas Copco, Himoinsa, FG Wilson, Woodward, Planelec, and Co-map, as well as other domestic and foreign competitors; certain of which focus on the market for diesel generators as they are also diesel engine manufacturers. Also, we compete against other regional packagers that serve local markets throughout the world.\nOther products\n– Relative to service parts and extended warranty revenue, all of the above-named companies are primary competitors. Relative to grid services optimization software, Autogrid and Energy Hub, along with other grid service solution providers, are primary competitors.\nIn a continuously evolving market, we believe our scale and broad capabilities make us well positioned to remain competitive. We compete primarily based on brand reputation, quality, reliability, pricing, innovative features, breadth of product offering, product availability and factory support.\nGovernment Incentives and Regulation, including Environmental Matters\nGenerac’s growing presence in energy technology solutions has increased our exposure to renewable energy mandates, investment tax credits and other demand-creation subsidies from certain existing and potential government incentives, such as incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed in 2022. These incentives cover a wide range of products and solutions, including MLPE solutions, solar plus storage systems, grid services, and grid-edge devices, and the availability, size, and outlook for such incentives can impact the markets for these products and solutions. Additionally, in 2023 Generac was selected by the Department of Energy to participate in two federally backed projects in Puerto Rico and Massachusetts that are focused on improving grid resiliency and efficiency with our residential energy technology solutions.\nAs a manufacturing company, our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations covering environmental, health and safety matters.

    "text": "You should carefully consider the following risks. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n14\nRisk factors related to our business and industry\nDecreases in the availability and quality, or increases in the cost, of raw materials\n,\nkey components\nand labor\nwe use to make our products could materially reduce our earnings.\nThe principal raw materials that we use to produce our products include steel, copper and aluminum as well as batteries and advanced electronic components. We also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products. The prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand, commodity prices, currencies, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, price controls, economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control. In fact, we have seen such trends significantly impact our business resulting in higher costs and shortages in materials, components and labor, and such impacts may continue or arise again in the foreseeable future. We typically do not have long-term supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices. In the short term, we have been unable to fully mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements, price increases to our customers, manufacturing productivity improvements, or hedging transactions, and if our mitigation efforts continue to not be fully effective in the short or long term, our profitability could be adversely affected. Also, our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers, including in some cases, suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components. It has been challenging to consistently obtain adequate, cost efficient or timely deliveries of certain required raw materials and components, or sufficient labor resources, and if this trend continues, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis. This could cause us to lose additional sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation.\nWe depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers and component suppliers, as well as single-source suppliers, for certain products and components, and our business and operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these parties.\nFor certain products we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build these products or supply these components, including but not limited to certain clean energy products or components. The timing of purchases in future periods could differ materially from our estimates due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. Further, the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues. As a result, fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner. If any of these contract manufacturers or component suppliers were unable or unwilling to manufacture or produce our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements, we would have to identify, qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Our reliance on such contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability, delivery schedules, quality issues, manufacturing yields and costs. Moreover, we single-source certain types of parts in our product designs. Delays in our suppliers' deliveries have impaired, and may continue to impair, our ability to deliver products to our customers. A wide variety of factors could cause such delays including, but not limited to, lack of capacity, economic downturns, availability of credit, logistical challenges, labor or material shortages, trade restrictions, weather events, political instability, wars, terrorism, civil unrest, disease or natural disasters. If any of these suppliers reduce or eliminate the supply of the components to us in the future, our revenues, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted. Although we have ongoing contractual disputes with certain such suppliers, such disputes have not to date had any significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nOur business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights to be important assets and seek to protect them through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements. These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products, or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business. Not only are intellectual property-related proceedings burdensome and costly, but they could take years to resolve, and we might not ultimately prevail. We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed.\nIn addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties' intellectual property rights. We currently are, and have previously been, subject to such third-party infringement claims, and may continue to be in the future. Any such claim, even if it is believed to be without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention, and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements. Certain parts of our business experience significant intellectual property litigation and we have in the past and could in the future become involved in costly and lengthy litigation involving patents or other intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business. We have recently been subject to adverse rulings or have settled claims for significant amounts related to the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, and may continue to be subject to such claims, damage awards or settlement payments. In addition, we may not prevail in such future proceedings. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business or potentially impair our patents and technology intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nFor further information, see Note “18. Commitments and Contingencies”.\n15\nWe may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability, warranty claims, recalls, or other claims.\nWe face a risk of exposure to current and future product liability claims alleging to arise from the use of our products and that may purportedly result in injury or other damage. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, such current insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims or damage awards or we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed. If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, product liability claims or other product related claims, including higher warranty costs, which may impact our reputation and resulting sales and profitability. For example, we have and may continue to experience product liability, product quality or reliability claims, or warranty claims with respect to certain clean energy, generator, and/or chore products, including being subject to certain consumer product class action lawsuits or other governmental fines or penalties in relation to such products. In the event such product or warranty related claims continue or are significantly higher in the future, or we incur losses or other damages associated with current or future product liability lawsuits or product related claims, this may continue to adversely affect our reputation or brand quality in relation to such products, subject us to significantly increased costs or penalties, and otherwise materially harm our results of operations, financial condition and our business. Even in litigation where we believe the likelihood of liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations or financial condition.\nWhile we do record reserves for future warranty claims, our estimated warranty accruals for previously sold products and our warranty costs for current product sales are based on assumptions using historical experience, and we do not have a long history with respect to certain products. As a result, these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of such products, causing us to incur substantial unanticipated expenses to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products. Our failure to accurately predict future claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nMoreover, we have and may continue to be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls have resulted in and may continue to lead to increased scrutiny, fines or other penalties by federal, state or international regulatory agencies on our operations or business and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFor further information, see Note “18. Commitments and Contingencies”.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase programs will be fully consummated or that they will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the market price of our stock and diminish our cash reserves.\nOn February 12, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company’s common stock over the next twenty-four months. The new program replaces the prior share repurchase program, which had approximately $26 million remaining available for repurchase when the new program was approved. Although our Board of Directors has authorized such share repurchase program, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Such program could also diminish our cash reserves. In addition, we may discontinue, modify or suspend our share repurchase program based on several factors, including our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Any modification, suspension, or termination of our share repurchase program could cause our stock price to decline. We cannot guarantee that such program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nThe risk of non-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our global operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives.\nOur global operations subject us to regulation by U.S. federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws, regulations and policies. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include import and export control, environmental, health and safety regulations, data privacy requirements, international labor laws and work councils and anti- corruption and bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.N. Convention Against Bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials.\nWe are subject to the risk that we, our employees, our affiliated entities, contractors, agents or their respective officers, directors, and employees may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws, for which we might be held responsible, particularly as we expand our operations geographically through organic growth and acquisitions. An actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives.\nIncreased scrutiny regarding our ESG practices could impact our reputation.\nIncreasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability, natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital, and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. We strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make progress in certain ESG priority issue areas. It is possible that we may be unsuccessful in the achievement of our ESG goals, on a timely basis or at all, or that the costs to achieve those goals become prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, our stakeholders may not be satisfied with our initiatives or efforts or the speed at which we are progressing towards any such aspirations and goals. Additionally, organizations that inform investors on ESG matters have developed rating systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG. Unfavorable ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment, which could negatively impact our stock price. Any failure, or perceived failure, to respond to ESG concerns could harm our business and reputation.\nOur business may face increased scrutiny from the investment community, regulators, media and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including our commitments, goals, targets and objectives, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. We are subject to increasing regulatory requirements around sustainability-related disclosures, including significant anticipated rulemaking by the SEC or other international governmental authorities, which may continue to evolve. Complying with regulators’ disclosure requirements may impose substantial additional costs and require additional resources, including with respect to third-party attestation, to enable the capture, analysis and audit of appropriate data. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in fines, penalties and civil liabilities, and damage to our reputation. Furthermore, if our sustainability reporting and practices do not meet investor, regulator or other stakeholders’ expectations, standards and requirements, our reputation, ability to attract or retain employees, and attractiveness as an investment, business partner or acquiror could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability commitments, goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to comply with reporting requirements and standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have operational, reputational, financial and legal impacts.\nIf we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop, our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nDifficulties or delays in research, development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. We continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. If we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. In addition, as new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older or obsolete product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands.\n16\nDemand for\nthe majority of\nour products is significantl\ny affected by unpredictable\npower\noutage\nactivity\nthat can lead to substantial variations in, and uncertainties regarding, our financial results from period to period.\nSales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns, and demand for the majority of our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms, hurricanes, ice storms, blackouts, public safety power shutoffs, and other power grid reliability issues, all of which affects our ability to accurately manage our business and forecast future results. The impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location, frequency and severity of the outages. Sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead, and in the past have led, to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result and have previously resulted in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory. There are smaller, more localized power outages that occur frequently that drive a baseline level of demand for back-up power solutions. The lack of major power outage events and fluctuations to the baseline levels of power outage activity are part of managing our business, and these fluctuations could have, and previously have had, an adverse effect on our net sales and profits. Despite their unpredictable nature, we believe power disruptions create awareness and accelerate adoption of our home standby products.\nDemand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses\n,\nand other macroeconomic conditions.\nOur business is affected by general economic conditions, and uncertainty or adverse changes, such as the prolonged downturn in U.S. residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards and rising interest rates or inflation. These have previously led and could lead again to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices. Our sales of light-commercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the non-residential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities. If these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors, our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the light-commercial and industrial sectors could be adversely affected. In addition, consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products, and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending has previously had, and could again have a material impact on our business. We currently do not have any material contracts with our customers which call for committed volume, and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products at the same level, if at all. If general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen, or if the non-residential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline, our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected. Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results, including increases in interest rates or sustained inflationary pressure which could negatively affect overall growth and impact sales of our products. Additionally, timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quarter-to-quarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets. Also, the availability, renewal or potential loss of renewable energy mandates and investment tax credits and other subsidies can have an impact on the demand for energy storage systems. Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate. Such risks or events may disrupt our supply chain and not enable us to produce products to meet customer demand.\nIf we do not forecast demand for our products accurately, we may experience product shortages, delays in product shipment, excess product inventory, difficulties in planning expenses or disputes with suppliers, any of which may\nadversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe manufacture our products based on both actual customer orders and our estimates of customer demand. This process requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors, their end customers, general market conditions, and other macroeconomic conditions. As a result, it may be difficult to forecast future customer demand to plan our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial condition. If we overestimate demand for our products, we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell. We may have to make significant provisions for inventory write-downs based on events that are currently not known, and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material. We may also become involved in disputes with our suppliers who may claim that we failed to fulfill forecast or minimum purchase requirements. Conversely, if we underestimate demand, we may not have sufficient inventory to meet end-customer demand, and we may lose market share, damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential revenue opportunities. Obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible, which could prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and cost-efficient manner or at all. In addition, if we overestimate our production requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory. If our contract manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the costs of such excess inventory through resale or return or build excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess parts or products and recognize related inventory write-downs.\nThe industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and our failure to compete successfully\ncould adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in markets that are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large, diversified companies which have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Some of our competitors have and may continue to be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us. In addition, we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established brands that enter our end markets. Demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality, to respond to downward pricing pressure, and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors. If we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures, we could lose market share, which could have an adverse impact on our results. For further information, see “Item 1—Business—Competition”.\nWe rely on independent dealers and distribution partners, and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners, or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label,\nnational\n, retail or equipment rental customers, would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell and install our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers. Their capacity constraints and/or inability to install and service our products, including their inability to hire, develop, or retain qualified technicians or other labor, could limit our ability to maintain and grow our sales. We also rely on our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands. In addition, we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment, electrical equipment and construction machinery companies; arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies; and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and other industrial customers. Our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large national, retail and other customers are typically not exclusive, and many of the distributors with whom we do business also offer competitors’ products and services.\nImpairment of our relationships with our distributors, dealers or large customers, loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers, or an increase in our distributors' or dealers' sales of our competitors' products to our customers or of our large customers' purchases of our competitors' products could materially reduce our sales and profits. For example, we have had, and may continue to have, disputes with one or more customers, distributors or dealers to whom we sell our products, including clean energy products, and this may reduce or limit the sales growth for such products. Additionally, our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify, attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform, including increasing the number of energy storage distributors, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts. For further information, see “Item 1—Business—Distribution Channels and Customers”.\nWe are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes\nor mix\nof our products on our net sales.\nBecause of the wide range of products that we sell, the level of customization for many of our products, the frequent rollout of new products, the different accounting systems utilized, and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products, we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume or mix changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales.\nRisk factors related to our operations\nThe loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on the efforts of certain key individuals, including the members of our senior management team, who have significant experience in the energy products and solutions industry. If, for any reason, our senior executives do not continue to be active in management, or if key employees leave our company, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Failure to continue to attract or retain these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations. If we need to replace any of these individuals in the near future, the loss of their services could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business if we do not have effective succession plans in place.\nDisruptions caused by labor dis\nputes or organized labor activities could harm our business.\nWe may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our non-union facilities. Disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers, which could result in loss of business. In addition, union activity could result in higher labor costs, which could harm our financial condition, results of operations and competitive position. A work stoppage or limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and operations can be adversely affected by our ability to attract, motivate, develop, and retain our employees.\nWe are committed to attracting, motivating, developing, and retaining our employees to ensure we remain an employer of choice. Despite our efforts, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, depending upon external market conditions, higher employee turnover and absenteeism. Furthermore, the competition for skilled personnel is often very competitive in markets where our facilities are located. Increased turnover rates within our employee base, perceived or actual deficiencies in total compensation paid to our employees in relation to competing employers, or as a result of general macroeconomic factors or otherwise, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and potentially further increase salaries and wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities and overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n17\nWe may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations.\nWhile we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities, a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial results. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\nIn addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing and production facilities are in Wisconsin within a 100-mile radius of each other. We could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin. In the event of a business interruption at our facilities, in particular our Wisconsin facilities, we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations, accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs, among other severe consequences. Such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business benefits from free trade agreements, and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The U.S. government has made changes in U.S. trade policy over the past several years. These changes include renegotiating and terminating certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and initiating tariffs on certain foreign goods from a variety of countries and regions, most notably China. These changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in, and may continue to result in, one or more foreign governments adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or import our products or components from those countries. The sales, gross margins, and profitability for each of our segments could be directly impacted by changes in tariffs and trade agreements.\nIn addition, certain of our products or key components or raw materials have and may continue to be subject to the imposition of higher duties as a result of anti-dumping and countervailing duties applied against them. To the extent such governmental actions, duties or tariffs are applied to such products, it could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which the U.S. or other countries will impose new or additional quotas, duties, tariffs, duties, taxes or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of our products in the future, nor can we predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The continuing adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, or realignments, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses.\nWe regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, and realignments to support our growth and management strategies. If we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings, as well as our results of operations and financial condition, could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business. The integration of independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. Further, integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management. As a result, we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs part of undertaking an acquisition, we may also significantly revise our capital structure or operational budget, such as issuing common stock that would dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders, assuming liabilities or debt, utilizing a substantial portion of our cash resources to pay for the acquisition or significantly increasing operating expenses. Our acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in charges being taken in an individual quarter as well as future periods, which results in variability in our quarterly earnings. In addition, our effective tax rate in any particular quarter may also be impacted by acquisitions. Following the closing of an acquisition, we may also have disputes with the seller regarding contractual requirements and covenants, purchase price adjustments, contingent payments or for indemnifiable losses. Any such disputes may be time consuming and distract management from other aspects of our business. As part of the terms of an acquisition, we may commit to pay additional contingent consideration if certain revenue or other performance milestones are achieved. We are required to evaluate the fair value of such commitments at each reporting date and adjust the amount recorded if there are changes to the fair value.\nIn addition, the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management's attention, and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include, among others:\nMany of these factors may be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration or management of our businesses. All these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition, and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock. As a result, we cannot be assured that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction.\n18\nA significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries, exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the United States.\nWe source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas, primarily in Asia and Europe. Our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with third-party sourcing generally. Such risks include:\nThese factors have had in the past and are currently having an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas. Additionally, if the U.S. dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers, our cost of goods sold could increase materially, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisk factors related to legal and regulatory matters\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our business, financial statements or on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to product design, safety, manufacture and performance liability, contracts, commercial disputes, competition, sales and trading practices, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities, regulatory compliance, personal injury, insurance coverage, and acquisition-related matters, as well as other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. These matters may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these matters may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending such matters, and we may be required to pay fines, penalties, damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements.\nThe industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, and we are subject to and may continue to be subject to such investigations and claims, including by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), CPSC and EPA, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. The Company is cooperating with such governmental inquiries, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such claims, or any other current or future claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period.\nAdditionally, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings or investigations may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nMoreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are reasonable, we cannot assure we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities that may arise. Any product liability claim may also include the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which may not be covered by insurance. Any claims brought against us, with or without merit, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations as a result of potential adverse outcomes, the expenses associated with defending such claims, the diversion of our management’s resources and time and the potential adverse effect to our business reputation.\nFor further information, see Note “18. Commitments and Contingencies”.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and non-compliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs, fines, sanctions and claims.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations including those governing, among other things, emissions to air; discharges to water; noise; and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. In addition, under federal and state environmental laws, we could be required to investigate, remediate and/or monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at third-party sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed. This liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused, or had any knowledge of, the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs. Violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers' compensation claims.\nOur products are subject to substantial government regulation.\nOur products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing, among other things, emissions, noise, labeling, transport, product content, product safety, and data privacy, including standards imposed by the EPA, CARB, CPSC and other regulatory agencies around the world. Also, as we increase our connectivity with our products and customers, we may be required to comply with additional data privacy and cybersecurity regulations. For example, personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe, and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated or pending under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general, legislatures, and consumer protection agencies. Internationally, many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we, relevant suppliers, and customers must comply. Although we have implemented certain policies, procedures, and, in other cases, contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and standards, any challenges or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional fines, costs, and liabilities to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business.\nThese laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent. As a further example, recent CARB regulations that will prohibit future sales in California of certain small off-road engines may negatively affect the long-term sales of certain products we sell today in that state. In addition, some cities or municipalities have imposed, or are considering, limiting natural gas connections to new buildings or imposing additional permitting restrictions which could adversely affect the sales of certain products we sell in such jurisdictions. Changes in applicable laws or regulations, or in the enforcement thereof, could require us to redesign or recall our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future. Developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets. In some cases, we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emissions and carbon monoxide. Typically, additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market.\nThe failure to comply with existing and future regulatory standards or requirements could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve, our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period.\n19\nRisk factors related to cybersecurity\nFailures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business\n.\nWe rely heavily on information technology (IT) both in our products and services for customers and in our IT systems used to run our business. Further, we collect and store sensitive information in cloud-based data centers and on our networks. Government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers, cyber-criminals, malicious insiders and other actors targeting confidential information and all types of IT systems. These actors may engage in fraudulent activities, theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage or ransomware.\nOur IT systems, our connected products, and our confidential information may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses, worms or other malicious software programs. The risk of such attacks may increase as we integrate newly acquired companies or develop new connected products and related software. These attacks pose a risk to the security of our products, private data, systems and networks and those of our customers, suppliers and third-party service providers, as well as to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data. While we attempt to mitigate these risks through board oversight, hiring additional internal cyber-security professionals to manage these risks, enhancing controls, due diligence, employee training and communication, third party intrusion testing, system hardening, email and web filters, regular patching, multi-factor authentication, surveillance, encryption, and other measures, we remain vulnerable to information security threats.\nWe monitor certain cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems, and we have experienced viruses and attacks targeting our IT systems and networks. Such prior events, to date, have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Despite the precautions we take, we have had, and could have again, an intrusion or infection of our systems or connected products. While such intrusions or infections to date have not resulted in the significant disruption of our business, or a loss of proprietary or confidential information, we cannot guarantee the same for future intrusions or infections. Similarly, an attack on our IT systems or connected products could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property, a breach of confidential customer or employee information, or product failure or misuse. Any such events could have an adverse impact on sales, harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns. As the threats evolve and become more potent, we may incur additional costs to secure the products that we sell, as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices.\nSee \"Item 1C. Cybersecurity\" for additional information related to cybersecurity risks.\nRisk factors related to our capital structure\nWe hav\ne\nindebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2023 we had total indebtedness of $\n1,575.2 m\nillion. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. While we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt, our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or other base rate. In connection with our credit agreement amendment in June 2022, SOFR became the new benchmark interest rate for the new Tranche A Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility, and all LIBOR provisions applicable to the existing Tranche B Term Loan Facility were replaced with SOFR provisions. If we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell securities, none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do. Our Term Loan B matures on December 13, 2026, and our Term Loan A as well as our Revolving Facility mature on June 29, 2027.\nThe terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions.\nOur credit facilities contain, and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including limitations on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. These restrictions set limitations on, among other things, our ability to:\nThe operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. A breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default. If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, or enforce their security interest, any of which would result in an event of default. The lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.\n20\nWe may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities, and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms, or at all, which may limit ou\nr ability to grow.\nWe may require additional financing to expand our business. Financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable. The terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt. In addition, economic conditions, including a downturn in the credit markets, could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies. In the future, if we are unable to refinance our credit facilities on acceptable terms, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur total assets include a substantial amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles. If we determine these have become impaired,\nour\nnet income could be materially adversely affected.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles are comprised of certain tradenames. At December 31, 2023, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles totaled\n$1,560.7 m\nillion. We review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of comprehensive income. Future impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line, adverse market conditions, a significant increase in interest rate, changes in the competitive landscape, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line, and a variety of other circumstances including any of the risk factors noted above. A reduction in net income resulting from the write-down or impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our process for evaluating goodwill for impairment.\nGeneral risk factors\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the other risk factors described herein, and other factors beyond our control, such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technology innovations or new products by us or our competitors, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nWe have experienced and may continue to see volatility in the market price of our stock price. As a result, we have been subject to securities class action litigation and may continue to be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nFor further information, see Note “18. Commitments and Contingencies”.\nOur business is subject to potential tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot be certain that the final determination of our tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made."

    "text": "The Company’s management and Board recognize the importance of strong oversight of cybersecurity risk, information security and technology in maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, partners, employees and stockholders. The Company maintains cybersecurity measures aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (Framework) which organizes cybersecurity risks into five categories: identify, protect, detect, respond and recover. Our processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats is incorporated into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program and evaluated against such Framework. Our information security and ERM teams coordinate to regularly review and assess these risks using a wide range of tools and services.\nOur cybersecurity risk is actively managed through our Cybersecurity Steering Committee, which has established Company-wide policies and standards concerning cybersecurity matters. These policies directly or indirectly relate to cybersecurity and include antivirus protection, remote access, multifactor authentication, containment of confidential information and the use of the internet, email and wireless devices. The Company’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for developing and implementing our information security program and regularly reports on cybersecurity matters to executive management and the Board of Directors. The CISO has over 25 years of experience supporting cybersecurity and information technology and is a board member of a local Cyber Threat Response Alliance organization.  Led by our CISO, team members who support our information security program have relevant educational and industry experience.\nThe CISO and information technology security team conduct regular risk assessments to identify areas requiring additional investment and resources. These risk assessments extend to our supply chain, where cybersecurity health assessments are employed for our critical suppliers. The results are used to calculate a Cybersecurity Risk Score, a key component of our Supply Chain Scorecard used to proactively identify and manage potential risks. Additionally, we generally require those third parties that could introduce significant cybersecurity risk to us to agree by contract to manage their cybersecurity risks in specified ways, as appropriate. Risk assessments are also performed on new products and software and we periodically engage third-party services for penetration testing and security evaluations. We also periodically assess our technology infrastructure and business processes to identify and address potential security gaps and vulnerabilities. An ISO 27001 certification is maintained within our Energy Services business.\nAs chair of the Cybersecurity Steering Committee, the CISO holds regular meetings to provide strategic updates on the Company’s cybersecurity infrastructure and preparedness. These meetings, supplemented by regular updates to the Board of Directors, are instrumental in aligning with the Company’s strategic goals. Our Board of Directors is also provided with ongoing education including updates on relevant legislation and regularly receives reports on cybersecurity risks, threats, incidents and other trends. Several members of our Board's Audit Committee have expertise and experience in cybersecurity, and one director is the President of a major cybersecurity services provider.\nIn order to promote a culture of security awareness across our organization, all employees are required to complete an annual cybersecurity awareness training and are provided with periodic information updates on cybersecurity threats. We also maintain cyber insurance policies to help partially mitigate the financial impact of a significant cybersecurity incident.\nDespite our best efforts, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent all potential cybersecurity incidents or breaches. Our systems are continually subject to sophisticated and evolving cyber threats, such as phishing, ransomware, social engineering, and advanced persistent threats. However, to date, we have not been subject to any incidents or successful cyber-attacks that materially impacted our operations or financial condition. The Company has invested in developing and acquiring cybersecurity capabilities allowing us to monitor threats and manage incident response. We have also developed internal policies to mitigate cybersecurity incidents, including providing clear guidelines for incident classification and response. We recognize the importance of continued monitoring and improvement of our cybersecurity program, and will continue to invest in our security controls, incident response capabilities, and third-party vendor management protocols.\nFor additional information on the cybersecurity risks that we face, also see Item 1A. “Risk Factors”."

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “Item 1 – Business,” the consolidated financial statements, and the related notes thereto in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Item 1A. - Risk Factors.”\nOverview\nGenerac is a leading energy technology solutions company that provides backup and prime power generation systems for residential and C&I applications, solar + battery storage solutions, smart home energy management devices and energy services, advanced power grid software platforms, and engine- & battery-powered tools and equipment. As an energy technology solutions company that is “Powering a Smarter World”, our corporate purpose is to lead the evolution to more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy solutions around the world.\nFurther information regarding our business is provided in “Part I, Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report.\nBusiness D\nrivers\nand Operational Factors\n“Part I, Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report contains information regarding business drivers, including key mega-trends and strategic growth themes under the subheading “Mega-Trends, Strategic Growth Themes, and Additional Business Drivers.”\nF\nactors\nAffecting Results of O\nperations\nWe are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations, which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control, including continued product development, expanded distribution, pricing, cost control, and hedging. Certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following:\nEffect of commodity, currency, component price fluctuations, and resource availability.\nIndustry-wide price fluctuations of key commodities, such as steel, copper and aluminum, along with other components we use in our products, as well as changes in labor costs required to produce our products, can have a material impact on our results of operations. Acquisitions in recent years have increased our use of advanced electronic components and battery cells, as well as further expanded our commercial and operational presence outside of the United States. Our international acquisitions, along with our existing global supply chain, expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and regulatory tariffs that can also have a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of any inflationary pressures through improved product design and sourcing, manufacturing efficiencies, price increases, and select hedging transactions. We have implemented multiple price increases over the past couple of years to help mitigate the impact of rising costs, and we continued to realize the benefit of these pricing actions in 2023. Our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates, which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us.\n24\nSeasonality.\nAlthough there is demand for our products throughout the year, in each of the past five years, approximately\n19% to 25% of our net sales occurred in the first quarter, 22% to 28% in the second quarter, 24% to 28% in the third quarter and 23% to 31% in\nthe fourth quarter, with different seasonality depending primarily on the occurrence, timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year. Major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and, as a result, our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period. The seasonality experienced during a major power outage, and for the subsequent quarters following the event, will vary relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred.\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict.\nIn February 2022, Russia commenced military action against Ukraine. In response, the U.S. and certain other countries imposed significant sanctions and export controls against Russia, Belarus and certain individuals and entities connected to Russian or Belarusian political, business, and financial organizations. In March 2022, we announced our suspension of operations and sales in Russia. However, the situation remains uncertain, and it is difficult to predict the impact that the conflict and actions taken in response to the conflict will have on our business. In particular, the situation could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, significantly hinder our ability to find materials or key single-sourced components we need to make certain products, or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFactors influencing interest expense.\nInterest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors, including market fluctuations in SOFR, interest rate election periods, interest rate swap agreements, repayments or borrowings of indebtedness, and amendments to our credit agreements. In connection with our credit agreement amendment in June 2022, SOFR became the new benchmark interest rate for the new Tranche A Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility, and all LIBOR provisions in the existing Tranche B Term Loan Facility were replaced with SOFR provisions. Interest expense increased during 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased borrowings and higher interest rates. Refer to Note 12, “Credit Agreements,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nFactors influencing provision for income taxes and cash\nincome\ntaxes paid.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the tax-deductible goodwill and intangible assets from our acquisition by CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC in 2006 were fully amortized. The expiration of this significant tax shield resulted in a higher cash income tax obligation in 2022 and will continue to result in a higher income tax obligation on a go-forward basis.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (the Act). The Act in part provides funding and tax incentives for certain clean energy products and projects. While the Act did not have a material impact on our results, we will continue to review the Act and any regulations or guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department or by a state which may provide a tax benefit or expense. We will update our future tax provisions based on new regulations or guidance accordingly.\nIn 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion model rules, designed to ensure large corporations are taxed at a minimum rate of 15% in all countries of operation. The OECD continues to release guidance and countries are implementing legislation to adopt the rules, some of which are effective on January 1, 2024. The United States has not yet enacted legislation implementing Pillar Two. We are continuing to evaluate the Pillar Two rules and their potential impact on future periods, but we do not expect the rules to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nComponents of Net Sales and E\nxpenses\nNet\nS\nales\nOur net sales primarily consist of product sales to our customers. This includes sales of our power generation equipment, energy storage systems, and other power products to the residential, commercial and industrial markets, as well as service parts to our dealer network. Net sales also include shipping and handling charges billed to customers, with the related freight costs included in cost of goods sold. Additionally, we offer other services, including extended warranties, installation, maintenance, data center and telecom design and build, remote monitoring, and grid services to utilities in certain circumstances. These services accounted f\nor less than 4% of\nour net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revenue streams and related revenue recognition accounting policies.\nWe are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales, with no single customer representing more\nthan 4% of our\nsales, and our top ten customers representing less than\n21%\nof our net sales in aggregate for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCosts of Goods S\nold\nThe principal elements of costs of goods sold are component parts, raw materials, inbound and outbound freight, factory overhead and labor. Component parts and raw materials comprised approximately\n69% of\ncosts of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2023. The principal component parts are engines, alternators, batteries, electronic controls, and steel enclosures. We design and manufacture air-cooled engines for certain of our generators up to 26kW, along with certain liquid-cooled, natural gas engines. We source engines for certain of our smaller products and all of our diesel products. For certain natural gas engines, we source the base engine block, and then add a significant amount of value engineering, sub-systems and other content to the point that we are recognized as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of those engines. We design and manufacture many of the alternators for our generators. We also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage. We source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable, high-quality suppliers. In some cases, these relationships are proprietary. For certain energy technology products, we source these products complete from certain contract manufacturers using our designs.\nThe principal sourced raw materials used in the manufacturing process are steel, copper and aluminum. We are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities, impacting our costs of goods sold. We seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing, product design improvements, manufacturing efficiencies, price increases and select hedging transactions. We are also impacted by foreign currency fluctuations given our global supply chain. There is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold.\nWe have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of any inflationary pressures through improved product design and sourcing, manufacturing efficiencies, price increases, and select hedging transactions. We have implemented multiple price increases over the past couple of years to help mitigate the impact of rising costs, and we continued to realize the benefit of these pricing actions in 2023. Our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates, which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us.\nThe balance of cost of goods sold include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities, factory overhead, labor and shipping costs. Factory overhead includes utilities, insurance, support personnel, depreciation, general supplies, and maintenance. Although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure, our margins can be impacted if we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales.\nOperating E\nxpenses\nOur operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our sales, marketing, distribution, service parts, warranty, engineering, information systems, human resources, accounting, finance, risk management, legal and tax functions, among others. These expenses include, among others, personnel costs such as salaries, bonuses, employee benefit costs, payroll taxes, and share-based compensation cost, and are classified into three categories: selling and service, research and development, and general and administrative. Additionally, the amortization expense related to our finite-lived intangible assets is included within operating expenses.\n25\nSelling and service.\nOur selling and service expenses consist primarily of personnel expense, marketing expense, standard assurance warranty expense, bad debt provisions, and other sales expenses. Our personnel expense recorded in selling and services expenses includes the expense of our sales force and other personnel involved in the marketing, sales and service of our products. Standard warranty expense is estimated based on historical trends or based on specific warranty matters as they become known and reasonably estimable. Our marketing expenses include media advertising, promotional expenses, co-op advertising costs, direct mail costs, printed material costs, product display costs, market research expenses, and trade show expenses. Marketing expenses are generally related to the launch of new product offerings, opportunities to create market awareness for our products, and general brand awareness marketing efforts. Our marketing campaigns are an important source for lead generation.\nResearch and\ndevelopment.\nOur research and development expenses include mechanical engineering, electronics engineering, and software development costs and they support numerous projects covering all of our product lines. They also support our connectivity, grid services, remote monitoring, and energy management initiatives. We operate engineering facilities with extensive capabilities at many locations globally and employ approximate\nly 1,100\npersonnel with focus on new product development, existing product improvement and cost containment. We are committed to research and development and rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and administrative.\nOur general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for general and administrative employees; accounting, legal and professional services fees; information technology costs; insurance; travel and entertainment expense; adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration; share-based compensation costs; and other corporate expenses.\nAcquisition related costs.\nAcquisition related costs are external costs incurred in connection with a business combination including legal fees, professional and advisory services, stamp tax, and indemnity and warranty insurance premiums.\nAmortization of intangibles.\nOur amortization of intangibles expense includes the straight-line amortization of finite-lived tradenames, customer lists, patents and technology, and other intangibles assets.\nOther\n(Expense) Income\nOther (expense) income includes the interest expense on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt financing costs and original issue discount, credit facility commitment fees, and interest accretion on contingent acquisition consideration. Other (expense) income also includes other financial items such as losses on extinguishment of debt, investment income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, and gains/losses on the sale of certain investments.\nResults of O\nperations\nA detailed discussion of the year-over-year changes from the Company's fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Company's fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 22, 2023.\nYear ended December 31, 2023 compared to year ended December 31, 2022\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated:\n26\nThe following sets forth our reportable segment information for the periods indicated:\nThe following table sets forth our net sales by product class for the periods indicated:\nNet sales.\nThe decrease in domestic segment sales for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nwas primarily driven by a decline in residential product sales, most notably in home standby generator, portable generator, and clean energy product shipments. Home standby generator sales for the year were impacted by elevated levels of field inventory together with strong prior year comparisons. The decline in residential product sales was partially offset by robust growth of C&I product sales for the full year, primarily driven by shipments to industrial distributors and to certain direct customers for “beyond standby” applications.\nThe increase in international segment sales for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nwas primarily driven by C&I growth in nearly all regions around the world, partially offset by weaker portable generator sales in Europe.\nIn addition, total net sales from non-annualized acquisitions for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nwere $65.4\nmillion, including $56.8 million for the domestic segment and $8.6 million for the international segment.\nGross profit.\nGross profit margin for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nwas 33.9% compared to 33.3% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022\n. The gross profit margin increase was primarily driven by favorable pricing actions and cost benefits resulting from lower raw material and logistics costs, as well as improved production efficiencies. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable sales mix primarily due to lower shipments of home standby generators.\nOperating expenses.\nOperating expenses increased $23.6 million, or 2.5%, as compared to the prior year.\nThe 2023 operating expenses included a $5.8 million provision for a regulatory matter with the CPSC, $28.3 million of legal charges related to patent and other litigation (see Note 18, “Commitments and Contingencies” for additional information), $4.4 million of additional customer support costs related to a clean energy product customer that filed for bankruptcy, and an increase in employee and marketing costs. The operating expenses in 2022 included a $37.3 million provision for clean energy product warranty-related matters, a $17.9 million provision for bad debt related to a clean energy product customer that filed for bankruptcy referenced above, as well as a $10.0 million provision for a regulatory matter with the CPSC.\nOther expense.\nThe increase in other expense, net in 2023 was driven primarily by higher interest costs due to higher borrowing levels and interest rates compared to the prior year.\nProvision for income tax\nes\n.\nThe effective income tax rates for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nwere 25.2% and 19.6%, respectively.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to significantly lower benefit from equity compensation in the current year, coupled with discrete tax benefits in the prior year.\nNet income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc.\nNet income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc. was $214.6 million as compared to $399.5 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net sales and other items noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined and reconciled to net income in, “Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted EBITDA” included below in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the domestic segment for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nwere 15.8% of domestic segment total sales compared to 18.2% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022\n. Adjusted EBITDA margin was lower in the year-ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to the significant impact of unfavorable sales mix and reduced operating leverage on lower sales volumes, as well as continued operating expense investments for future growth. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable price and cost benefits.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the international segment, before deducting for non-controlling interests, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nwere 13.7% of international segment total sales compared to 13.8% in the prior year, primarily due to\nunfavorable sales mix, which was mostly offset by favorable price and cost benefits and improved operating leverage on higher sales volumes.\nAdjusted net income.\nAdjusted Net Income is defined and reconciled to net income in, “Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted Net Income” included below in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Adjusted Net Income of $335.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\ndecreased 37.8% from $538.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nprimarily due to the factors outlined above, together with the impact of various add-backs in the current and prior years.\n27\nLiquidity and Financial P\nosition\nOur primary cash requirements include payment for raw materials and components, salaries and benefits, facility and lease costs, operating expenses, interest and principal payments on debt, and capital expenditures. We finance our operations primarily from cash flow generated from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nOur credit agreements originally provided for a $1.2 billion term loan B credit facility (Tranche B Term Loan Facility) and currently include a $300.0 million uncommitted incremental term loan facility. Additionally, our credit agreements previously provided for a $500.0 million ABL Facility that was paid off and terminated in June 2022.\nIn June 2022, we amended and restated our existing credit agreements (Amended Credit Agreement) that resulted in a new term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million (Tranche A Term Loan Facility), a new $1.25 billion revolving facility (Revolving Facility), the termination of the former ABL Facility, and replacement of all LIBOR provisions with SOFR provisions. Proceeds received from the Tranche A Term Loan Facility were used to repay the total existing outstanding balance on our former ABL Facility and make a $250 million voluntary prepayment on the Tranche B Term Loan Facility, with the remaining funds used for future general corporate purposes. As a result of these prepayments, we wrote off $3.5 million of original issue discount and capitalized debt issuance costs during the second quarter of 2022 as a loss on extinguishment of debt. The Revolving Facility was unfunded at closing.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $530 million outstanding under the Tranche B Term Loan Facility, $745.3 million outstanding under the Tranche A Term Loan Facility, and\n$150\nmillion of funded Revolving Facility borrowings, leaving $\n1,099.2\nmillion of unused capacity, net of outstanding letters of credit. Our Tranche B Term Loan Facility bears interest at rates based on either a base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.75% or adjusted SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75%, subject to a SOFR floor of 0.0%. Beginning on January 1, 2023, the Tranche A Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate based on adjusted SOFR plus an applicable margin between 1.25% and 1.75%, based on our total leverage ratio and subject to a SOFR floor of 0.0%. At December 31, 2023, the interest rates for the Tranche A Term Loan Facility, Revolving Facility, and Tranche B Term Loan Facility we\nre 6.99%, 6.94%, and 7.19%,\nrespectively. See Note 5, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" and Item 7A for further information on interest rate swaps, which help to reduce our borrowing costs.\nThe Tranche B Term Loan Facility matures on December 13, 2026, while the Tranche A Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility mature on June 29, 2027. The Tranche A Term Loan Facility is repayable in installments due at the end of each quarter commencing September 2023. Payments on the Revolving Facility are not due until 2027. The maturity schedule on these facilities is as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had total liquidity of\n$1,193.8 million under our most restrictive debt covenants, which consists of $201.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $992.8 m\nillion available under our Revolving Facility. We believe we have a strong liquidity position that allows us to execute our strategic plan and provides the flexibility to continue to invest in future growth opportunities.\nIn September 2020, our Board of Directors approved a $250.0 million stock repurchase program, which was exhausted in the third quarter of 2022. In July 2022, our Board of Directors approved another stock repurchase program, which commenced on August 5, 2022, and allowed for the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of our common stock over a 24-month period. Additionally, on February 12, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company’s common stock over the next twenty-four months. The new program replaces the prior share repurchase program, which had approximately $26.3 million remaining available for repurchase when the new program was approved. Pursuant to the approved program, we may repurchase our common stock from time to time, in amounts and at prices we deem appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. The repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management at its discretion and in compliance with the terms of our credit agreements. The repurchases may be funded with cash on hand, available borrowings, or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased\n2,188,475\nshares of our common st\nock for $251.5 m\nillion, and 2,722,007 shares for $345,840, respectively. Since the inception of all stock repurchase programs (starting in August 2015), we have repurchased\n13,937,188 shares of common stock for $1,028.9 million (at an average cost per share of $73.82).\nWe have periodically reissued shares out of Treasury stock, including for earnout payments.\nSee Note 12, “Credit Agreements,” and Note 13, “Stock Repurchase Program,” to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our credit agreements and stock repurchase programs.\nWe have an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for selected dealers. This arrangement provides liquidity for our dealers by financing dealer purchases of Generac products with credit availability from the finance company. We receive payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer, and our dealers are given a longer period of time to pay the finance company. If our dealers do not pay the finance company, we may be required to repurchase the applicable inventory held by the dealer. We do not indemnify the finance company for any credit losses they may incur. Total dealer purchases financed under this arrangement accounted for approximately\n12%\nand\n15%\nof net sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding was\n$158.0\nmillion and $212.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLong-term L\niquidity\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and availability under our Revolving Facility and other short-term lines of credit will provide us with sufficient capital to continue to run our operations. We may use a portion of our cash flow for debt repayments and common stock buybacks, impacting the amount available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. As we continue to expand our business, we may require additional capital to fund other shareholder value enhancing activities.\nCash F\nlow\nYear ended December 31, 2023 compared to year ended December 31, 2022\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows by source (use) for the periods presented:\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily represents a significantly lower investment in working capital as compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower operating earnings.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nprimarily consisted of cash payments of $129.1 million for the purchase of property and equipment (net of $10.9 million of capital expenditures in accounts payable at December 31, 2023), $30.0 million for a minority investment in Wallbox, $16.0 million for the acquisition of REFU, $6.6 million for a tax equity investment, and a $2.6 million minority investment in Rolling Energy Resources and Earth Foundry.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nprimarily consisted of cash payments of $86.2 million for the purchase of property and equipment (net of $7.7 million of capital expenditures in accounts payable at December 31, 2022), $25.1 million for business acquisitions, $15.0 million investment in WATT Fuel Cell Corporation, and $14.9 million for contributions to a tax equity investment, which were partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale of an investment for $1.3 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nprimarily represents proceeds of $348.8 million from long-term borrowings, $64.3 million from short-term borrowings, and $7.8 million from the exercise of stock options. These cash proceeds were more than offset by $104.8 million in cash payments used to purchase the remaining ownership interest in Pramac, $251.5 million used for stock repurchases, $325.8 million of debt repayments ($37.1 million of short-term borrowings and $288.7 million of long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations), $10.9 million of taxes paid related to equity awards, and $5.0 million for payment of contingent acquisition consideration.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nprimarily includes proceeds of $1,026.3 million from long-term borrowings, $248.2 million from short-term borrowings, and $13.8 million from the exercise of stock options. These cash proceeds were partially offset by $810.3 million of debt repayments ($268.1 million of short-term borrowings and $542.2 million of long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations), $345.8 million of stock repurchases, $40.9 million of taxes paid related to equity awards, $16.1 million of contingent acquisition consideration, and $10.3 million for debt issuance costs.\n28\nSenior Secured Credit F\nacilities\nRefer to Note 12, “Credit Agreements,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 and the “Liquidity and Financial Position” section included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on our senior secured credit facilities.\nCovenant C\nompliance\nThe Term Loans restrict the aggregate amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid and, in certain circumstances, requires pro forma compliance with certain fixed charge coverage ratios or gross leverage ratios, as applicable, in order to pay certain dividends and distributions. The Term Loans also contain other affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, liens on property, sale and leaseback transactions, investments, loans and advances, mergers or consolidations, asset sales, acquisitions, transactions with affiliates, prepayments of certain other indebtedness and modifications of our organizational documents. The Tranche A Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility include certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio below 3.75 to 1.00 as well as an interest coverage ratio above 3.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s total leverage ratio was\n2.18\nto 1.00, and the Company's interest coverage ratio was\n6.44 to 1.00.\nThe Company was also in compliance with these and all other covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023. The Tranche B Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial maintenance covenants.\nThe Term Loans contain customary events of default, including, among others, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts, failure to perform covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, cross-defaults with other material indebtedness, certain undischarged judgments, the occurrence of certain ERISA, bankruptcy or insolvency events, or the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Term Loan). A bankruptcy or insolvency event of default will cause the obligations under the Term Loans to automatically become immediately due and payable.\nThe Revolving Facility also contains covenants and events of default substantially similar to those in the Term Loans, as described above.\nContractual O\nbligations\nThe following table summarizes our expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023, using the interest rates in effect as of that date:\n(1) The Tranche B Term Loan matures on December 13, 2026. The Tranche A Term Loan and the Revolving Facility mature on June 29, 2027. As of December 31, 2023, there was $150 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility classified as long-term debt.\n(2) Finance lease obligations, including current portion includes a payment for a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised in 2025.\n(3) Short-term borrowings consist of borrowings by our foreign subsidiaries on local lines of credit.\nCapital E\nxpenditures\nOur operations require capital expenditures for facilities and related improvements, technology, research & development, tooling, equipment, capacity expansion, internal use software, IT systems & infrastructure and upgrades. Capital expenditures were\n$129.1\nmillion, $86.2 million, and $110.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and were funded primarily through cash from operations.\n29\nCritical Accounting P\nolicies and Estimates\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect our supplemental information disclosures, including information about contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe, given current facts and circumstances, that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to U.S. GAAP, and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. We make routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, prepaid expenses, product warranties and other reserves. Management believes our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas: business combinations and purchase accounting; goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment; and income taxes. The following is a discussion of critical accounting estimates in each of these areas.\nBusiness\nC\nombinations and\nP\nurchase\nA\nccounting\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of an acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values, the values of assets in use, and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. While the ultimate responsibility resides with management, for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including intangible assets, tangible long-lived assets, and contingent consideration. Acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased. This methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, profit margins, forecasted cash flows, discount rates and terminal growth rates. If the contingent consideration is deemed significant or absent an agreed upon payout amount, the initial measurement of contingent consideration and the corresponding liability is evaluated using the Monte Carlo Method. For this valuation method, management develops projections covering the contingent consideration period utilizing various potential pay-out scenarios. Probabilities are applied to each potential scenario and the resulting values are discounted using a rate that considers weighted average cost of capital as well as a specific risk premium associated with the riskiness of the contingent consideration itself, the related projections, and the overall business. Refer to Note 1, “Description of Business,” and Note 3, “Acquisitions,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Company’s business acquisitions.\nGoodwill and Other\nIndefinite-Lived\nI\nntangible\nA\nssets\nWe performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, and found no impairment.\nWhen preparing a discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of our annual impairment test, we make a number of key estimates and assumptions. We estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs. In addition, we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation. This discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year. Weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures, market betas, risk-free rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we revised the operating structure within our international reportable segment. As a result, Latin America no longer met the definition of a reporting unit. We performed a final impairment test of the Latin America reporting unit prior to the change in operating structure. We calculated the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 12% and thus found no impairment. The carrying value of Goodwill for our Latin America reporting unit as of the final impairment test was $52.4 million.\nFor all reporting units, a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests. While we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable, different assumptions could change the estimated fair values. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include:\nIf management's estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors, the estimate of the fair values may change significantly. Such change could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nRefer to Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Policies – Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Company’s policy regarding the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n30\nIncome T\naxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740,\nIncome Taxes\n. Our estimates of income taxes payable, deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate are based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal, state and international income tax laws; the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities; estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions; and current accounting standards. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known.\nIn assessing the net realizable value of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the taxable income in prior carryback years, scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nRefer to Note 15, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Company’s income taxes and income tax positions.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, refer to Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Policies - New Accounting Pronouncements,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide the computation of Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Company, which is defined as net income before noncontrolling interests adjusted for the following items: interest expense, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, income tax expense, certain non-cash gains and losses including certain purchase accounting adjustments and contingent consideration adjustments, share-based compensation expense, losses on extinguishment of debt, certain transaction costs and credit facility fees, business optimization expenses, certain specific provisions, and adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests, as set forth in the reconciliation table below. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA is based primarily on the definition included in our Credit Agreement.\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of our performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA not only due to its importance for purposes of our credit agreements, but also because it assists us in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis as it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\n31\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company. Management believes the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA offers an additional financial metric that, when coupled with results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors for the following reasons:\nThe adjustments included in the reconciliation table listed below are presented to illustrate the operating performance of our business in a manner consistent with the presentation used by our management and Board of Directors. These adjustments eliminate the impact of a number of items that:\nWe explain in more detail in footnotes (a) through (f) below why we believe these adjustments are useful in calculating Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\n32\nFurthermore, as noted above, one of our uses of Adjusted EBITDA is as a benchmark for determining elements of compensation for our senior executives. At the same time, some or all of these senior executives have responsibility for monitoring our financial results, generally including the adjustments in calculating Adjusted EBITDA (subject ultimately to review by our Board of Directors in the context of the Board's review of our financial statements). While many of the adjustments (for example, transaction costs and credit facility fees), involve mathematical application of items reflected in our financial statements, others involve a degree of judgment and discretion. While we believe all of these adjustments are appropriate, and while the calculations are subject to review by our Board of Directors in the context of the Board's review of our financial statements, and certification by our Chief Financial Officer in a compliance certificate provided to the lenders under our Term Loan and Revolving Facility, this discretion may be viewed as an additional limitation on the use of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Generac Holdings Inc.:\n(a) Represents the following non-cash charges, gains, and other adjustments: gains/losses on the disposition of assets other than in the ordinary course of business, gains/losses on sales of certain investments, unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on commodity contracts, certain foreign currency related adjustments, and certain purchase accounting and contingent consideration adjustments. We believe that adjusting net income for these items is useful for the following reasons:\n(b) Represents share-based compensation expense to account for stock options, restricted stock and other stock awards over their respective vesting period.\n(c) Represents the non-cash write-off of original issue discount and deferred financing costs due to voluntary prepayments of debt. Refer to Note 12, “Credit Agreements,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the losses on extinguishment of debt.\n(d) Represents transaction costs incurred directly in connection with any investment, as defined in our credit agreement, equity issuance or debt issuance or refinancing, together with certain fees relating to our senior secured credit facilities, such as administrative agent fees and credit facility commitment fees under our Amended Credit Agreement, which we believe to be akin to, or associated with, interest expense and whose inclusion in Adjusted EBITDA is therefore similar to the inclusion of interest expense in that calculation.\n(e) Represents severance and other restructuring charges related to the consolidation of certain operating facilities and organizational functions.\n(f) Represents the following significant and unusual charges not indicative of our ongoing operations:\n•  a provision for judgments and legal expenses related to certain patent and other litigation - $28.3 million in 2023.\n•  a provision for a matter with the CPSC concerning the imposition of civil fines for allegedly failing to timely submit a report under the CPSA in relation to certain portable generators that were subject to a voluntary recall previously announced on\nJuly 29, 2021 - $5.8 million in 2023; $10.0 million in 2022.\n•  a bad debt provision and additional customer support costs related to a clean energy product customer that filed for bankruptcy in 2022 – $4.4 million additional customer support costs in 2023; $17.9 million bad debt provision in 2022.\n•  a warranty provision to address certain clean energy product warranty-related matters - $37.3 million in 2022.\n33\nAdjusted Net Income\nTo further supplement our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide the computation of Adjusted Net Income attributable to the Company, which is defined as net income before noncontrolling interest adjusted for the following items: amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount related to our debt, intangible impairment charges (if any), certain transaction costs and other purchase accounting adjustments, losses on extinguishment of debt, business optimization expenses, certain specific provisions, other non-cash gains and losses or charges, and adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as set forth in the reconciliation table below. In addition, for periods prior to 2022, adjusted net income reflects cash income tax expense due to the existence of the tax shield from the amortization of tax-deductible goodwill and intangible assets from our acquisition by CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC in 2006. Due to the expiration of this tax shield in the fourth quarter of 2021, there is no similar reconciling item starting in 2022.\nWe believe Adjusted Net Income is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our company’s operations. Management believes the disclosure of Adjusted Net Income offers an additional financial metric that, when used in conjunction with U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of our ongoing results of operations, and the factors and trends affecting our business.\nThe adjustments included in the reconciliation table listed below are presented to illustrate the operating performance of our business in a manner consistent with the presentation used by investors and securities analysts. Similar to the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation, these adjustments eliminate the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance or cash flows, such as amortization costs, transaction costs and write-offs relating to the retirement of debt. Prior to the expiration of our tax shield in the fourth quarter of 2021, we also made adjustments to present cash taxes paid as a result of our favorable tax attributes.\nSimilar to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income does not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc.:\n(a) For the years ended December 31, 2021, the amount is based on a cash income tax rate of 19.7% due to the existence of the tax shield from the amortization of tax-deductible goodwill and intangible assets from our acquisition by CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC in 2006. Due to the expiration of this tax shield in the fourth quarter of 2021, there is no similar reconciling item for the 2022 or 2023 periods.\n(b) Represents transaction costs incurred directly in connection with any investment, as defined in our credit agreement, equity issuance or debt issuance or refinancing, and certain purchase accounting and contingent consideration adjustments.\n(c) Represents gains and losses attributable to the disposition of a business or assets occurring in other than ordinary course, as defined in our credit agreement.\n34"

    "text": "We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To reduce the risk from these changes, we use financial instruments from time to time. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nForeign C\nurrency\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, as well as operating businesses and supply chains in foreign countries. Periodically, we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with certain foreign currency purchases and sales in the normal course of business. Contracts typically have maturities of twelve months or less. Realized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the statements of comprehensive income.\nThe following is a summary of the\n53 foreign currency c\nontracts outstanding as of December 31, 2023 (notional amount in thousands):\nCommodity P\nrices\nWe are a purchaser of commodities and components manufactured from commodities including steel, aluminum, copper and others. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. We generally buy these commodities and components based on market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process. Depending on the supplier, these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags and calculations. To the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers, or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices, we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies or supply chain savings to offset increases in commodity costs.\nIn 2021 and 2022, we experienced an increase in commodity and component costs resulting from supply chain challenges and the overall inflationary environment. We implemented multiple price increases to help mitigate the impact of these rising commodity costs, and the realization of these price increases in 2022 and 2023 helped to partially offset the higher commodity costs.\nPeriodically, we engage in certain commodity risk management activities to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results. These derivatives typically have maturities of less than eighteen months. As of December 31, 2023, we had\nno commodity contracts outstanding.\nInterest R\nates\nAs of December 31, 2023, all of the outstanding debt under our Term Loans and Revolving Facility was subject to floating interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2023, we had the following interest rate swap contracts outstanding (notional amount in thousands of US dollars), to help minimize our borrowing costs:\nIn June 2022, in conjunction with the amendments to the Company's credit agreements discussed further in Note 12, “Credit Agreements,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company amended its interest rate swaps to match that of the underlying debt and reconfirmed hedge effectiveness. The Company formally documented all relationships between interest rate hedging instruments and the related hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as cash flow hedges and therefore, the effective portions of their gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in the consolidated balance she\nets. At\nDecember 31, 2023\n, the fair value of these interest rate swaps was an asset of $39.8 million, excluding the impact of credit risk.\nEven after giving effect to these swaps, we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our Term Loans and Revolving Facility that is not covered by the swaps.\nA hypothetical change in the SOFR interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed annual interest expense by approximately $9.5 million (or, without the swaps in place, $14.5 million) in 2023.\nFor additional information on the Company’s foreign currency and commodity forward contracts and interest rate swaps, including amounts charged to the statements of comprehensive income during 2023, 2022, and 2021, refer to Note 5, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and Note 6, “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n35"

    "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Generac Holdings Inc.\nWaukesha, WI\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Generac Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n—\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill - Refer to Notes 2 and 9\nto the consolidated financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s estimate for each reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective reporting unit. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions including estimates of future revenue, forecasted operating costs, and discount rates. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value, which could result in an impairment charge. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of October 31 or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change. In the Latin America impairment analysis, the reporting unit had an estimated fair value that exceeded the carrying value by approximately 12%. Because the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value, no impairment was recorded. The carrying value of goodwill for the Company’s Latin America reporting unit as of the impairment assessment was $52.4 million.\nKey financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the Latin America reporting unit include forecasted revenue, forecasted operating costs, and the discount rate.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that the evaluation of the Latin America reporting unit's goodwill is a critical audit matter is that there is a high degree of auditor effort, judgment and subjectivity involved in designing and performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the Latin America reporting unit.\n36\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the forecasts of revenue, forecasted operating costs, and the selection of the discount rate for the Latin America reporting unit included the following, among others:\nRevenue\n–\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company has a wide range of products and services that are offered in various markets throughout the world. The Company’s business activities are carried out by numerous individual business units, which offer a unique set of products and services within specific geographic areas.\nWe identified revenue as a critical audit matter given the disaggregated nature of the Company’s operations and business units generating revenue. This required extensive audit effort due to the volume of the underlying transactions and distinctiveness of each individual business unit. High levels of auditor judgment were necessary to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue transactions included the following, among others:\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nFebruary 21, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\n37\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Generac Holdings Inc.\nWaukesha, Wisconsin\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Generac Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n—\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n—\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nFebruary 21, 2024\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\nGenerac Holdings Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\n(\nU.S.\nDollars in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)\nFounded in\n1959,\nGenerac Holdings Inc. (the Company) is a leading global designer and manufacturer of a wide range of energy technology solutions. The Company provides power generation equipment, energy storage systems, energy management devices & solutions, and other power products serving the residential, light commercial, and industrial markets. Generac’s power products and solutions are available globally through a broad network of independent dealers, distributors, retailers, e-commerce partners, wholesalers, and equipment rental companies, as well as sold direct to certain end user customers.\nOver the years, the Company has executed a number of acquisitions that support its strategic plan (refer to Item\n1\nin this Annual Report on Form\n10\n-K for discussion of the Company's “Powering a Smarter World” strategic plan). A summary of acquisitions affecting the reporting periods presented include:\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany amounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash\nand Cash\nEquivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of\nthree\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains the majority of its domestic cash in a few commercial banks in multiple operating and investment accounts. Balances on deposit are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to specified limits. Balances in excess of FDIC limits are uninsured.\n43\nOne customer accounted for approximately\n7\n%\nand\n11\n% of accounts receivable at\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n, respectively.\nNo\none\ncustomer accounted for greater than\n4\n%\n,\n4\n%, and\n6\n%, of net sales during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023\n,\n2022\n, and\n2021\n, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company's trade and other receivables primarily arise from the sale of its products and services to independent residential dealers, industrial distributors and dealers, national and regional retailers, electrical/HVAC/solar wholesalers, e-commerce partners, equipment rental companies, equipment distributors, solar installers, utilities, EPC companies, telecommunications customers, and certain end users with payment terms generally ranging from\n30\nto\n90\ndays. The Company evaluates the credit risk of a customer when extending credit based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that\nmay\naffect the customers' ability to pay. These factors include the customer's financial condition, past payment experience, credit bureau information, and regional considerations.\nReceivables are recorded at their face value amount less an allowance for credit losses. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which represents an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual life of its receivables considering current market conditions and estimates for supportable forecasts when appropriate. The Company measures expected credit losses on its trade receivables on an entity-by-entity basis. The estimate of expected credit losses considers a historical loss experience rate that is adjusted for delinquency trends, collection experience, and/or economic risk where appropriate based on current market conditions. Additionally, management develops a specific allowance for trade receivables known to have a high risk of expected future credit loss.\nThe Company holds various credit insurance plans that cover the risk of loss up to specified amounts on certain trade receivables. As of\nDecember 31, 2023,\nthe Company had gross receivables of\n$\n571,241\nand an allowance for credit losses of\n$\n33,925\n.\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the Company's allowance for credit losses:\n(\n1\n) Includes a specific credit loss provision of $\n17,926\nrecorded during\n2022\nfor a clean energy product customer that filed for bankruptcy.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the\nfirst\n-in,\nfirst\n-out method.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, including internal use software and software to provide a service, is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are summarized below (in years). Costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease (including renewal option periods) or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. The Company capitalizes significant software enhancements. Implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets and operating lease and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the expected service period. Finance lease right of use assets are included in property and equipment. Refer to Note\n10,\n“Leases,” to the consolidated financial statements for the Company's lease disclosure.\nTotal depreciation expense was\n$\n62,408\n,\n$\n52,821\n, and $\n42,155\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable net assets acquired from business acquisitions. Goodwill is\nnot\namortized, but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of impairment are present. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of\nOctober 31\nor more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value\nmay\nnot\nbe recoverable. The Company has the option to assess goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. The qualitative assessment determines whether it is more likely than\nnot\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is\nnot\nmore likely than\nnot\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is\nnot\nrequired to be performed. If the Company determines that it is more likely than\nnot\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company is required to perform the quantitative test. In the quantitative test, the calculated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its book value, the related goodwill is\nnot\nimpaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain tradenames. The Company tests the carrying value of these tradenames annually as of\nOctober 31,\nor more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value\nmay\nnot\nbe recoverable, by comparing the assets’ fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the fair value of the tradename is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had the Company\nnot\nowned the tradename and instead licensed the tradename from another company.\nThe Company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for the fiscal years\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, and found\nno\nimpairment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames). Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nmay\nnot\nbe recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset.\n44\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt discounts and direct costs incurred in connection with the issuance or amendment of long-term debt are deferred and recorded as a reduction of outstanding debt and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the related credit agreements.\n$\n3,885\n,\n$\n3,234\n, and $\n2,589\n, of deferred financing costs and original issue discount were amortized to interest expense during fiscal years\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively. Excluding the impact of any future long-term debt issuances or prepayments, estimated amortization to interest expense for the next\nfive\nyears is as follows:\n2024\n-\n$3,923;\n2025\n-\n$3,919;\n2026\n-\n$3,819;\n2027\n-\n$1,028;\n2028\n-\n$\n0\n.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is a C Corporation and therefore accounts for income taxes pursuant to the liability method. Accordingly, the current or deferred tax consequences of a transaction are measured by applying the provision of enacted tax laws to determine the amount of taxes payable currently or in future years. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the income tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than\nnot\nthat some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will\nnot\nbe realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers taxable income in prior carryback years, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies, as appropriate, in making this assessment.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenues primarily consist of product sales to its customers. The Company considers the purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with the customers. For each contract, the Company considers the commitment to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of product, which is generally the price stated in the contract specific for each item sold, adjusted for the value of expected returns, discounts, rebates, or other promotional incentives or allowances offered to our customers. Expected returns for damaged or defective product are estimated using the expected value method based on historical product return experience. Discounts and rebates offered to customers are typically defined in the master sales agreements with customers and, therefore, are recorded using the most likely amount method based on the terms of the contract. Promotional incentives are defined programs offered for short, specific periods of time and are estimated using the expected value method based on historical experience. The Company does\nnot\nexpect the transaction price for revenue recognized will be subject to a significant revenue reversal. As the Company’s product sale contracts and standard payment terms have a duration of less than\none\nyear, it uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does\nnot\nconsider the time value of money. Sales, use, value add, and other similar taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The Company has elected to recognize the cost for freight activities when control of the product has transferred to the customer as an expense within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Product revenues are recognized at the point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer. To determine when control has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and if legal title, physical possession, and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset has transferred to the customer. As a substantial portion of the Company’s product revenues are recognized at a point in time, the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations at each period end is\nnot\nmaterial. The Company’s contracts have an original expected duration of\none\nyear or less. As a result, the Company has elected to use the practical expedient to\nnot\ndisclose its remaining performance obligations.\nWhile the Company’s standard payment terms are less than\none\nyear, the specific payment terms and conditions in its customer contracts vary. In some cases, customers prepay for their goods; in other cases, after appropriate credit evaluation, an open credit line is granted and payment is due in arrears. Contracts with payment in arrears are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as accounts receivable upon revenue recognition, while contracts where customers pay in advance are recognized as customer deposits and recorded in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized. The balance of customer deposits (contract liabilities) was\n$\n19,173\na\nnd\n$\n33,551\nat\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\nDecember 31, 2022\n, respectively. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\n, the Company recognized revenue\nof $\n33,551\nrelated to amounts included in the\nDecember 31, 2022\ncustomer deposit balance. The Company typically recognizes revenue within\none\nyear of the receipt of the customer deposit.\n45\nThe Company offers standard warranty coverage on substantially all products that it sells and accounts for this standard warranty coverage as an assurance warranty. As such,\nno\ntransaction price is allocated to the standard warranty, and the Company records a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale to a customer based on historical warranty experience. Refer to Note\n11,\n“Product Warranty Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s standard warranties.\nThe Company also sells extended warranty coverage for certain products, which it accounts for as service warranties. In most cases, the extended warranty is sold as a separate contract. As such, extended warranty sales are considered a separate performance obligation, and the extended warranty transaction is separate and distinct from the product. The extended warranty transaction price is initially recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized on a straight-line basis to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the life of the contracts following the standard warranty period. For extended warranty contracts that the Company sells under a\nthird\n-party marketing agreement, it is required to pay fees to the\nthird\n-party service provider and classifies these fees as costs to obtain a contract. The contract costs are deferred and recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred contract costs are amortized to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income consistent with how the related deferred revenue is recognized. Refer to Note\n11,\n“Product Warranty Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s extended warranties.\nIn addition to extended warranties, the Company offers other services, including remote monitoring, installation, maintenance, data center and telecom design and build, and grid services to utilities in certain circumstances. Total service revenues accounted for less th\nan\n4%,\n3%,\nand\n2%\nof net sal\nes during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\nRefer to Note\n7,\n“Segment Reporting,” to the consolidated financial statements for the Company’s disaggregated revenue disclosure. The information discussed above is applicable to each of the Company’s product classes.\nAdvertising and Co-Op Advertising\nExpenditures for advertising, included in selling and service expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for advertising production costs are expensed when the related advertisement is\nfirst\nrun. Expenditures for Co-Op advertising are expensed when claimed by the customer. Total expenditures for advertising w\nere $\n118,303\n, $\n100,589\n, and $\n66,660\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Total expenditures incurred for research and development were\n$\n173,443\n,\n$\n159,774\n, and $\n104,303\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nBalance sheet amounts for non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of the fiscal year. Income and expenses incurred in a foreign currency are translated at the average rates of exchange in effect during the year. The related balance sheet translation adjustments are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity, in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized as incurred in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC\n820\n-\n10,\nFair Value Measurement\n,\ndefines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis. ASC\n820\n-\n10\nclarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the pronouncement establishes a\nthree\n-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level\n1\n) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level\n2\n) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level\n3\n) unobservable inputs in which there is little or\nno\nmarket data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Company believes the carrying amount of its financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings, and revolving facility borrowings), excluding Term Loan borrowings, approximates the fair value of these instruments based on their short-term nature. The fair value of the Term Loan B borrowing, which has a net carrying value o\nf $\n524,946\n,\nwas approximately\n$\n531,325\n(Level\n2\n) at\nDecember 31, 2023\n, as calculated based on independent valuations whose inputs and significant value drivers are observable.\nThe fair value of Term Loan A and Revolving Facility approximates the carrying value.\n46\nFor the fair value of the assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis, excluding the contingent consideration discussed below, refer to the fair value table in Note\n5,\n“Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of all derivative contracts is classified as Level\n2.\nThe valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of derivative contracts, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair value of derivative contracts considers the Company’s credit risk in accordance with ASC\n820\n-\n10.\nContingent Consideration\nCertain of the Company's business combinations involve potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones. As part of purchase accounting, a liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period, and the change in fair value is recognized within general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The fair value measurement of contingent consideration is typically categorized as a Level\n3\nliability, as the measurement amount is based primarily on significant inputs that are\nnot\nobservable in the market.\nThe fair value of contingent consideration for Chilicon and Pramac as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nwas $\n38,937\n, which was reported in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe fair value of contingent consideration as of\nDecember 31, 2022\nwas $\n81,533\n, of which $\n49,500\nwas reported in other accrued liabilities and $\n32,033\nin other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The contingent consideration for Chilicon extends through\nDecember 31, 2028.\nThe contingent consideration for Pramac extends through\nDecember 31, 2025.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the activity for contingent consideration:\n(\n1\n) Represents $\n11,490\nof contingent deferred consideration for the Pramac buyout. See Note\n4,\n\"Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\".\n(\n2\n) Includes payments of $\n479\nin cash and $\n44,521\nin shares for the ecobee acquisition, $\n4,286\nin shares for the Chilicon acquisition, and $\n4,500\nin cash for the Mean Green acquisition. The payment of common stock is accounted for as a non-cash item in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company records all derivatives in accordance with ASC\n815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n,\nwhich requires derivative instruments to be reported in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships. The Company is exposed to market risk such as changes in commodity prices, foreign currencies and interest rates.

The\n49\n% noncontrolling interest in Captiva had an acquisition date fair value of $\n3,165\nand was recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets, as the noncontrolling interest holder had within its control the right to require the Company to redeem its interest in Captiva. The noncontrolling interest holder has a put option to sell his interest to the Company any time after\nfive\nyears from the date of acquisition, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Further, the Company has a call option that it\nmay\nredeem any time after\nfive\nyears from the date of acquisition, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. The put and call option price is based on a multiple of earnings, subject to the terms of the acquisition agreement. In\nMarch\n2022,\nthe Company signed an agreement to purchase an additional\n15\n% ownership interest in Captiva for a purchase price of $\n461\n, bringing the Company's total ownership interest in Captiva to\n66\n%.

However, the redemption value adjustments are reflected in the earnings per share calculation, as detailed in Note\n14,\n“Earnings Per Share,” to the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interest for both Captiva and Pramac:\nCommodities\nThe Company is exposed to price fluctuations in commodities including steel, copper and aluminum; and periodically utilizes commodity derivatives to mitigate the impact of these potential price fluctuations on its financial results. These derivatives typically have maturities of less than\neighteen\nmonths.\nBecause these contracts do\nnot\nqualify for hedge accounting, the related gains and losses are recorded in cost of goods sold in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net pre-tax gains recognized\nwere\nnot\nmaterial\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively. At\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022,\nthe\nCompany had\nno\ncommodity contracts outstanding.\nForeign Currencies\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company periodically utilizes foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with certain foreign currency purchases and sales in the normal course of business. Contracts typically have maturities of\ntwelve\nmonths or less.\nBecause these contracts do\nnot\nqualify for hedge accounting, the related gains and losses are recorded in “other, net” in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net pre-tax gains (losses) recognized for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\nwere\nnot\nmaterial. As of\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n, the Company had\n53\nand\n34\nforeign currency contracts outstanding, respectively.\n52\nInterest Rate Swaps\nIn\n2017,\nthe Company entered into\ntwenty\ninterest rate swap agreements, the f\ninal\nfour\no\nf which expired in\nMay 2023.\nIn\nMarch 2020,\nthe Company entered into\nthree\nadditional interest rate swap agreements which were still outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nIn\nJune 2022,\nin conjunction with the amendments to the Company's credit agreements discussed further in Note\n12,\n“Credit Agreements,” to the consolidated financial statements, the Company amended its interest rate swaps to match the underlying debt and reconfirmed hedge effectiveness. The Company formally documented all relationships between interest rate hedging instruments and the related hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as cash flow hedges and therefore, the effective portions of their gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe amount of after-tax unrealized gains (losses) recognized for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\nwe\nre $(\n8,004\n),\n$\n38,494\n, and $\n20,529\n, respectively. The cash flows of the swaps are recognized as adjustments to interest expense each period. The ineffective portions of the derivatives’ changes in fair value, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings.\nFair Value\nThe following table presents the fair value of the Company’s derivatives:\nThe fair values of the interest rate swaps are included in operating lease and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n.\nExcluding the impact of credit risk, the fair value of the derivative contracts as of\nDecember 31, 2023,\nand\nDecember 31, 2022,\nis an asset of $\n39,796\nand $\n51,184\n, respectively, which represents the net amount the Company would receive to exit all of the agreements on that date.\nThe following presents a tabular disclosure of changes in AOCL during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n, net of tax:\n53\nThe Company has\ntwo\nreportable segments for financial reporting purposes – domestic and international. The domestic segment includes the legacy Generac business and the acquisitions that are based in the U.S. and Canada, all of which have revenues substantially derived from the U.S. and Canada. The international segment includes acquisitions\nnot\nbased in the U.S and Canada, all of which have revenues substantially derived from outside the U.S and Canada. Both reportable segments design and manufacture a wide range of energy technology solutions and other power products. The Company has multiple operating segments, which it aggregates into the\ntwo\nreportable segments, based on materially similar economic characteristics, products, production processes, classes of customers, distribution methods, organizational structure, and regional considerations.\nThe Company's product offerings consist primarily of power generation equipment, energy storage systems, energy management devices & solutions, and other power products geared for varying end customer uses. While Residential products and Commercial & Industrial (C&I) products include similar products, they differ based on power output and end customer. The composition of net sales between residential, C&I, and other products & services by reportable segment is as follows:\n54\nResidential products consist primarily of automatic home standby generators ranging in output from\n7.5kW\nto\n150kW,\nportable generators, residential energy storage systems, energy management devices & solutions, and other outdoor power equipment. These products are predominantly sold through independent residential dealers, national and regional retailers, e-commerce merchants, electrical/HVAC/solar wholesalers, solar installers, and outdoor power equipment dealers. The residential products revenue consists of the sale of the product to our distribution partners, who in turn sell or rent the product to the end consumer, including installation and maintenance services. In some cases, residential products are sold direct to the end consumer. Substantially all of the residential products' revenues are transferred to the customer at a point in time.\nC&I products consist of larger output stationary generators used in C&I applications, with power outputs up to\n3,250kW.\nAlso included in C&I products are mobile generators, light towers, C&I energy storage systems, mobile heaters, mobile pumps, and related controllers for power generation equipment. These products are sold globally through industrial distributors and dealers, EPC companies, equipment rental companies, and equipment distributors. The C&I products revenue consists of the sale of the product to our distribution partners, who in turn sell or rent the product to the end customer, including installation and maintenance services. In some cases, C&I products are sold direct to the end customer. Substantially all of the C&I products revenues are transferred to the customer at a point in time.\nOther consists primarily of aftermarket service parts and product accessories sold to our customers, the amortization of extended warranty deferred revenue, remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue, as well as certain installation and maintenance service revenue. The aftermarket service parts and product accessories are generally transferred to the customer at a point in time, while the extended warranty and subscription revenue are recognized over the life of the contract. Other service revenue is recognized when the service is performed, sometimes based on achievement of milestones.\nThe following tables sets forth total sales by reportable segment and inclusive of intersegment sales:\nManagement evaluates the performance of its segments based primarily on Adjusted EBITDA, which is reconciled to Income before provision for income taxes below. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA is based primarily on the definition that is contained in the Company’s credit agreements.\n55\nThe following tables summarize additional financial information by reportable segment:\nThe Company’s sales in the United States represent approxim\nately\n77\n%,\n8\n0%,\nand\n82\n% of total sales for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively. Approx\nimately\n74\n%\nand\n77\n% of the Company’s identifiable long-lived assets are located in the United States as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022,\nrespectively.\nInventories consist of the following:\n56\nProperty and equipment consists of the following:\nTotal property and equipment included finance leases of\n$\n68,079\nand\n$\n24,719\nat\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022,\nrespectively, primarily comprised of buildings and improvements. Amortization of finance lease right of use assets is recorded within depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The initial measurement of new finance lease right of use assets is accounted for as a non-cash item in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Refer to Note\n10,\n“Leases,” for further information regarding the Company’s accounting for leases under ASC\n842,\nLeases.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\nare as follows:\nRefer to Note\n3,\n“Acquisitions,” to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s acquisitions.\nGoodwill applicable to each reportable segment at\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\nis as follows:\n57\nThe following table summarizes intangible assets by major category as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n:\nAmortization expense of intangible assets wa\ns $\n104,194\n, $\n103,320\n, and $\n49,886\nin\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively. Excluding the impact of future acquisitions, the Company estimates amortization expense for the next\nfive\nyears to be as follows:\n2024\n-\n$96,595;\n2025\n-\n$91,694;\n2026\n-\n$84,833;\n2027\n-\n$58,065;\n2028\n- $\n52,354\n.\nThe Company leases certain manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, office space, warehouses, automobiles, machinery and computer equipment globally under both finance and operating leases. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of up to\n18\nyears, of which certain leases, primarily within the buildings and improvements asset class, include options to extend for up to\n10\nadditional years. Further, the Company leases certain buildings from a related party, which the Company has determined to be arm's length transactions.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company recognizes a right of use (ROU) asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases generally do\nnot\nprovide an implicit interest rate, the incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is a collateralized rate determined based on the lease term, the Company’s credit rating, and other market information available at the commencement date. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to the commencement date and is reduced by any lease incentives. The lease term\nmay\ninclude options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while lease expense for finance leases is recognized as depreciation and interest expense using the effective interest method. The Company’s variable lease expense generally consists of property tax and insurance payments that are variable in nature, however, these amounts are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements and are therefore\nnot\nseparately reported.\nThe Company has lease agreements with both lease and non-lease components, which it elected to account for as a single lease component. However, the Company did\nnot\nelect to apply the recognition exception for short-term leases. The Company is applying these elections to all asset classes.\nThe Company is a lessor of certain of its C&I mobile products as part of a rental fleet, as well as\ntwo\nof its buildings that it leases to\nthird\nparties. The lease income related to these arrangements is\nnot\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company records its operating lease cost and amortization of finance lease ROU assets within cost of goods sold or operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income depending on the cost center of the underlying asset. The Company records its finance lease interest cost within interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n58\nThe components of total lease cost consist of the following:\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s leases is as follows:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s leases is as follows:\n59\nWeighted average remaining lease term and discount rate information related to the Company’s leases as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\nis as follows:\nThe maturities of the Company’s lease liabilities as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nare as follows:\nThe Company records a liability for standard product warranty obligations accounted for as assurance warranties at the time of sale of the related product to a customer based on historical warranty experience. The Company also records a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the Company’s standard product warranty liability accounted for as an assurance warranty:\nThe Company also sells extended warranty coverage for certain products, which it accounts for as a service warranty. The sales of extended warranties are recorded as deferred revenue, and typically have a duration of\nfive\nto\nten\nyears. The deferred revenue related to extended warranty coverage is amortized over the duration of the extended warranty contract period, following the standard warranty period, using the straight-line method. The Company believes the straight-line method is appropriate because the performance obligation is satisfied based on the passage of time. The amortization of deferred revenue is recorded to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the deferred revenue related to extended warranty coverage:\n60\nThe timing of recognition of the Company’s deferred revenue balance related to extended warranties at\nDecember 31, 2023\nis as follows:\nThe Company has a post-sale extended warranty marketing agreement with a\nthird\nparty, pursuant to which the Company is required to pay fees to the\nthird\n-party service provider based on the number of extended warranty contracts that they sell, which it classifies as costs to obtain a contract. These fees are deferred and recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and then amortized to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the same period that the underlying deferred revenue is recognized. Deferred contract costs as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\nwere\n$\n10,153\nan\nd $\n9,199\n, respectively. Amortization of deferred contract costs recorded during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\nwas\n$\n2,306\n,\n$\n1,932\n, and $\n1,739\n, respectively.\nStandard product warranty obligations and extended warranty related deferred revenues are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nShort-term borrowings included in the consolidated balance sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\nconsisted of borrowings by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries on local lines of credit totaling $\n81,769\nand $\n48,990\n, respectively.\nLong-term borrowings are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\n61\nMaturities of long-term borrowings outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2023\n, excluding finance lease obligations (as their maturities are disclosed in Note\n10,\n“Leases,”) and before considering original issue discount and deferred financing costs, are as follows:\nThe Tranche B Term Loan Facility matures on\nDecember 13, 2026,\nwhile the Tranche A Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility mature on\nJune 29, 2027.\nThe Tranche A Term Loan Facility is repayable in installments due at the end of each quarter commencing\nSeptember 2023.\nThe Company’s credit agreements originally provided for a $\n1,200,000\nTranche B Term Loan Facility and included a $\n300,000\nuncommitted incremental term loan on that facility. The Tranche B Term Loan Facility initially bore interest at rates based on either a base rate plus an applicable margin of\n1.75\n% or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of\n2.75\n%, subject to a LIBOR floor of\n0.75\n%. After a number of amendments, the Tranche B Term Loan Facility currently bears interest at rates based on either a base rate plus an applicable margin of\n0.75\n% or adjusted SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of\n1.75\n%, subject to a SOFR floor of\n0.00\n%. The interest rate for the Tranche B Term Loan Facility as of\nDecember\n31,\n2023,\nwa\ns\n7.19\n%.\nThe Tranche B Term Loan Facility does\nnot\nrequire an Excess Cash Flow payment if the Company’s net secured leverage ratio is maintained below\n3.75\nto\n1.00.\nAs of\nDecember\n31,\n2023,\nthe Company’s net secured leverage ratio\nwas\n2.05\nto\n1.00,\nand the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Tranche B Term Loan Facility. There are\nno\nfinancial maintenance covenants on the Tranche B Term Loan Facility.\nThe Company’s credit agreements also originally provided for a senior secured ABL revolving credit facility (ABL Facility). ABL Facility borrowings initially bore interest at rates based on either a base rate plus an applicable margin of\n1.00\n% or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of\n2.00\n%, in each case, subject to adjustments based on average availability under the ABL Facility.\nIn\nMay 2021,\nthe Company amended the ABL Facility, increasing its borrowing limit from $\n300,000\nto $\n500,000\n, raising its incremental capacity from $\n100,000\nto $\n200,000\n, and extending the maturity date from\nJune 12, 2023\nto\nMay 27, 2026 (\nAmended ABL Facility). In addition, the Amended ABL Facility modified the pricing by reducing certain applicable interest rates to either a base rate plus an applicable margin of\n0.00\n% to\n0.25\n% or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of\n1.00\n% to\n1.25\n%, in each case, based on average availability under the Amended ABL Facility. In connection with this amendment, the Company capitalized $\n920\nof new debt issuance costs as deferred financing costs on long-term borrowings in the\nsecond\nquarter of\n2021.\nAt the same time, the Company also amended its Tranche B Term Loan Facility agreement to reflect the same amendments made to the ABL Facility.\nIn\nMay 2021,\nthe Company borrowed $\n50,000\nunder the Amended ABL Facility, the proceeds of which were used as a voluntary prepayment of the Tranche B Term Loan Facility. As a result of this prepayment of the Tranche B Term Loan Facility, the Company wrote off $\n831\nof original issue discount and capitalized debt issuance costs during the\nsecond\nquarter of\n2021\nas a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nIn\nJune 2022,\nthe Company amended and restated its existing credit agreements (Amended Credit Agreement) that resulted in a new term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $\n750,000\n(Tranche A Term Loan Facility), established a new $\n1,250,000\nrevolving facility (Revolving Facility), terminated the former asset-based lending facility (ABL Facility), and replaced all LIBOR provisions with SOFR provisions. Proceeds received by the Company from the Tranche A Term Loan Facility were used to repay the total existing outstanding balance on the Company's former ABL Facility and to make a $\n250,000\nvoluntary prepayment on the Tranche B Term Loan Facility, with the remaining funds used for future general corporate purposes. As a result of these prepayments, the Company wrote off $\n3,546\nof original issue discount and capitalized debt issuance costs during the\nsecond\nquarter of\n2022\nas a loss on extinguishment of debt.\n62\nThe Tranche A Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility initially bore interest at a rate based on adjusted SOFR plus an applicable margin of\n1.5\n% through\nDecember 31, 2022,\nsubject to a SOFR floor of\n0.0\n%. Beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2023,\nthe Tranche A Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate based on adjusted SOFR plus an applicable margin between\n1.25\n% and\n1.75\n%, based on the Company's total leverage ratio and subject to a SOFR floor of\n0.0%.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2023,\nthe interest rate for the Tranche A Term Loan Facility is\n6.99\n% and the interest rate for the Revolving Facility is\n6.94\n%.\nThe Tranche A Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility added certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio below\n3.75\nto\n1.00\nas well as an interest coverage ratio above\n3.00\nto\n1.00.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2023,\nthe Company’s total leverage ratio\nwas\n2.18\nto\n1.00,\nand the Company's interest coverage ratio was\n6.44\nto\n1.00.\nThe Company was also in compliance with all other covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe Tranche B Term Loan Facility, Tranche A Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and are secured by associated collateral agreements which pledge a\nfirst\npriority lien on virtually all of the Company’s assets, including fixed assets and intangibles, cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets and proceeds thereof.\nIn connection with the\nJune 2022\nrefinancing and in accordance with ASC\n470\n-\n50,\nthe Company capitalized $\n10,330\nof fees paid to creditors as deferred financing costs on long-term borrowings and expensed $\n800\nof transaction fees. The Company evaluated on a lender-by-lender basis if the debt related to returning lenders on the Revolving Facility was significantly modified or\nnot,\nresulting in the write-off of $\n197\nin unamortized deferred financing costs related to the former ABL Facility as a loss on extinguishment of debt.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2023,\nthere was $\n150,000\noutstanding under the Revolving Facility, leaving\n$\n1,099,203\no\nf unused capacity, net of outstanding letters of credit. Total availability on the Revolving Facility is reduced t\no $\n992,833\nu\nnder the Company's most restrictive debt covenants.\nIn\nSeptember 2020,\nthe Company’s Board of Directors approved a $\n250,000\nstock repurchase program, which was exhausted in the\nthird\nquarter of\n2022.\nIn\nJuly\n2022,\nthe Company's Board of Directors approved another stock repurchase program, which commenced on\nAugust 5, 2022,\nand allowed for the repurchase of up to $\n500,000\nof the Company's common stock over a\n24\n-month period. Additionally, on\nFebruary 12, 2024,\nthe Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $\n500,000\nof the Company’s common stock over the next\ntwenty-four\nmonths. The new program replaces the prior share repurchase program, which had approximately $\n26,297\nremaining available for repurchase when the new program was approved. Pursuant to the approved program, the Company\nmay\nrepurchase its common stock from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. The repurchases\nmay\nbe executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management at its discretion and in compliance with the terms of the Company's credit agreements. The repurchases\nmay\nbe funded with cash on hand, available borrowings, or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources. The stock repurchase program\nmay\nbe suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\nthe Company repurchased\n2,188,475\nshares of its common stock for\n$\n251,513\n.\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022,\nthe Company repurchased\n2,722,007\nshares of its common stock for $\n345,840\n. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\nthe Company repurchased\n350,000\nshares of its common stock for $\n125,992\n. Since the inception of all stock repurchase programs (starting in\nAugust 2015),\nthe Company has repurchased\n13,937,188\nshares of the Company's common stock\nfor $\n1,028,892\n(at an average cost per share of $\n73.82\n).\nWe have periodically reissued shares out of Treasury stock, including for earnout payments.\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, exclusive of restricted shares. Except where the result would be anti-dilutive, diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming the vesting of unvested restricted stock and the exercise of stock options, as well as the satisfaction of certain contingent acquisition consideration conditions as of the end of the period. Refer to Note\n4,\n“Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest,” to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for redeemable noncontrolling interests within earnings per share.\n63\nThe following table reconciles the numerator and the denominator used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share:\nThe Company’s provision for income taxes consists of the following:\nThe Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign jurisdiction tax returns which are subject to examination up to the expiration of the statute of limitations. The Company believes the tax positions taken on its returns would be sustained upon an exam, or where a position is uncertain, adequate reserves have been recorded. As of\nDecember 31, 2023\n, the Company is\nno\nlonger subject to income tax examinations for United States federal income taxes for tax years prior to\n2020.\nDue to the carryforward of net operating losses and research & development credits, the Company’s Wisconsin state income tax returns for tax years\n2007\nthrough\n2022\nremain open. In addition, the Company is subject to audit by various foreign taxing jurisdictions for tax years\n2012\nthrough\n2023.\nThe Company is regularly under tax return examination by tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The Company is actively managing the examinations and working to address any open matters. While the Company does\nnot\nbelieve any material taxes or penalties are due, there is a possibility that the ultimate tax outcome of an examination\nmay\nresult in differences from what was recorded. Such differences\nmay\naffect the provision for income taxes in the period in which the determination is made and could impact the Company’s financial results.\n64\nSignificant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n, deferred tax assets of $\n15,532\nand $\n12,746\n, and deferred tax liabilities of $\n90,012\nand $\n125,691\n, respectively, were reflected on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company maintains a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets when it is uncertain it will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the asset. During\n2023\n, the valuation allowance increased by $\n498\nprimarily due to the establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions where we believe the deferred tax assets\nmay\nnot\nbe able to be fully utilized.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2023,\nthe Company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $\n218,432\n, which have varying expiration periods ranging from\n2024\nto indefinite. For carryforward amounts which the Company believes the losses will expire prior to use, a valuation allowance has been established. For all other carryforwards the Company believes it will generate sufficient taxable income in these jurisdictions to utilize its loss carryforwards.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2023\n, the Company had state manufacturing tax credit carryforwards of approximately $\n29,196\n, which expire between\n2028\nand\n2038.\nThe Company believes it will generate sufficient taxable income in these jurisdictions to fully utilize the credits prior to their expiration.\nChanges in the Company’s gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, were as follows:\nThe unrecognized tax benefit as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n, total accrued interest of approximately $\n532\nand $\n161\n, respectively, and accrued penalties of approximately $\n1,275\nand $\n422\n, respectively, associated with net unrecognized tax benefits are included in the consolidated balance sheets. Interest and penalties are recorded as a component of income tax expense\nThe Company does\nnot\nexpect a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the fiscal year ending\nDecember\n31,\n2024.\n65\nA reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\nis as follows:\nMedical and Dental Plans\nThe Company maintains medical and dental benefit plans covering its full-time domestic employees and their dependents. These plans are partially or fully self-funded under which participant claims are obligations of the plan. These plans are funded through employer and employee contributions at a level sufficient to pay for the benefits provided by the plan.\nThe Company’s contributions to the plans were $\n26,090\n,\n$\n31,180\n, and $\n24,189\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\nEmployees of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries participate in government sponsored medical benefit plans and other local plans. In certain cases, the Company purchases supplemental medical coverage for certain employees at these foreign locations. The expenses related to these plans are\nnot\nmaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nSavings Plan\nThe Company maintains a defined-contribution\n401\n(k) savings plan for eligible domestic employees. Under the plan, employees\nmay\ndefer receipt of a portion of their eligible compensation. The Company\nmay\ncontribute a matching contribution of\n50\n% of the\nfirst\n6\n% of eligible compensation of employees that is deferred. The Company\nmay\nalso contribute a non-elective contribution for eligible employees employed on\nDecember 31, 2008\nthat were impacted by the freezing of the Company’s pension plans. The Company’s matching contributions are subject to vesting. Forfeitures\nmay\nbe applied against plan expenses and Company contributions. The Company recognized\n$\n3,735\n,\n$\n4,141\n, and $\n6,725\nof expense related to these plans for the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\n66\nThe Company adopted an equity incentive plan (the\n2010\nPlan) on\nFebruary 10, 2010\nin connection with its initial public offering. The\n2010\nPlan, as amended, allowed for granting of up to\n9.1\nmillion share-based awards to executives, directors and employees. Awards available for grant under the\n2010\nPlan included stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other share-based awards and performance-based compensation awards. New grants under the\n2010\nPlan ceased in\nJune 2019.\nTotal share-based compensation expense related to the\n2010\nPlan, net of estimated forfeitures, was $\n309\n, $\n2,379\n, and $\n6,249\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nOn\nJune 13, 2019,\nthe stockholders of Generac Holdings Inc. approved the Company’s\n2019\nEquity Incentive Plan (the\n2019\nPlan). The\n2019\nPlan allows for granting of up to\n2.7\nmillion share-based awards to executives, directors and employees. Awards available for grant under the\n2019\nPlan include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other share-based awards and performance-based compensation awards. Total share-based compensation expense related to the\n2019\nPlan, net of estimated forfeitures, was\n$\n35,183\n,\n$\n27,102\n, and $\n17,705\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nStock Options\n- Stock options granted in\n2023\nhave an exercise price between\n$\n110.86\nper share and $\n119.57\nper share; stock options granted in\n2022\nhave an exercise price between $\n103.50\nper share and $\n315.88\nper share; and stock options granted in\n2021\nhave an exercise price between $\n323.66\nper share and $\n438.83\nper share. Stock options vest in equal installments over\nfour\nyears, subject to the grantee’s continued employment or service and expire\nten\nyears after the date of grant.\nStock option exercises can be net-share settled such that the Company withholds shares with value equivalent to the exercise price of the stock option awards plus the employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes. Total shares withheld w\nere\n31,030\n,\n1\n7,376,\nand\n8,608\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively, and were based on the value of the stock on the exercise dates. The net-share settlement has the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduce the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued.\nEmployees can also utilize a cashless for cash exercise of stock options, such that all exercised shares will be sold in the market immediately. Cash equivalent to the exercise price of the awards plus the employees’ minimum statutory tax obligations is remitted to the Company, with the remaining cash being transferred to the employee. Total net proceeds to the Company from the cashless for cash exercise of stock options were\n$\n7,815\n,\n$\n13,786\n, and $\n38,787\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTotal payments made by the Company to the taxing authorities for the employees’ tax obligations related to stock option exercises wer\ne $\n4,895\n, $\n14,089\n, and $\n31,680\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility is calculated based on an analysis of historic volatility of the Company’s stock price. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury\nzero\n-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on actual share option forfeiture history and are trued up upon vesting based on actual forfeiture activity.\n67\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model for\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\nare as follows:\nA summary of the Company’s stock option activity and related information for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\nis as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2023\n, there was\n$\n18,109\nof total unrecognized compensation cost, net of expected forfeitures, related to unvested options. The cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining service period, having a weighted-average period of\n2.6\nye\nars. Total share-based compensation cost related to stock options for the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\nwas $\n8,229\n,\n$\n6,911\n, and $\n6,462\n, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nRestricted Stock\n– Restricted stock awards vest in equal installments over\nthree\nyears, subject to the grantee’s continued employment or service. Certain restricted stock awards also include performance shares, whereby the number of performance shares that can be earned are contingent upon Company performance measures over a\nthree\n-year period. Performance measures are based on a weighting of a number of financial metrics, from which grantees\nmay\nearn from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of their target performance share award. The performance period for the\n2021\nawards covers the years\n2021\nthrough\n2023.\nThe performance period for the\n2022\nawards covers the years\n2022\nthrough\n2024.\nThe performance period for the\n2023\nawards covers the years\n2023\nthrough\n2025.\nThe Company estimates the number of performance shares that will vest based on projected financial performance. The fair value of restricted awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's stock on the grant date. The fair market value of the restricted awards at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated forfeitures and is trued up upon vesting based on actual forfeiture activity.\nRestricted stock vesting is net-share settled such that, upon vesting, the Company withholds shares with value equivalent to the employees’ minimum statutory tax obligation, and then pays the cash to the taxing authorities on behalf of the employees. In effect, the Company repurchases these shares and classifies them as treasury stock. Total shares withheld w\nere\n50,577\n,\n92,008\n, and\n80,583\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively, and were based on the value of the stock on the vesting dates. Total payments made by the Company to the taxing authorities for the employees’ tax obligations related to restricted stock vesting were $\n6,002\n, $\n26,834\n, and\n$27,\n223\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n68\nA summary of the Company's restricted stock activity for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\nis as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2023\n, there was\n$\n53,392\nof unrecognized compensation cost, net of expected forfeitures, related to non-vested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining service period, having a weighted-average period of\n2.0\nyears. Total share-based compensation cost related to the restricted stock for the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n, inclusive of performance shares, was $\n27,263\n, $\n22,570\n, and $\n17,492\n, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nDuring\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n,\n16,174\n,\n8,572\n, and\n4,677\nshares of stock, respectively, were granted to certain members of the Company’s Board of Directors as a component of their compensation for their service on the Board, all of which were fully vested at time of grant. A non-employee director can elect to receive his or her director fees in the form of deferred stock units, which voluntarily defers the issuance of the related shares granted until the director separates from the Company, or a triggering event occurs.\n8,832\n,\n5,008\n, and\n3,160\nof deferred stock units are included in the shares of stock granted to certain members of the Company’s Board of Directors for the years\n2023\n,\n2022\n, and\n2021\n, respectively. Total share-based compensation cost for these share grants in\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\nwas $\n1,846\n,\n$1,\n886,\nand $\n1,579\n, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThe Company has an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for certain dealers. The Company receives payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer. The Company participates in the cost of dealer financing up to certain limits and has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance company but does\nnot\nindemnify the finance company for any credit losses they incur. The amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding under this arrangement at\nDecember 31, 2023\nand\n2022\nwas approximately\n$\n158.0\nmillion\nand $\n212.0\nmillion, respectively.\nOn\nAugust 1, 2022,\nPower Home Solar, LLC d/b/a Pink Energy (PHS) filed a lawsuit in the Western District of Virginia against Generac Power Systems, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Generac Power). The complaint alleges breaches of warranty, product liability, and other various causes of action against Generac Power relating to the sale and performance of certain clean energy equipment and seeks to recover damages, including consequential damages, that PHS allegedly incurred. The Company disputes the allegations in the complaint, including that PHS can seek consequential damages or amounts greater than the $\n25.0\nmillion liability cap set forth in the agreement between the parties.

On\nJune 23, 2023,\na jury issued a verdict in a consolidated action in the Western District of Texas (Case Nos.\n21\n-cv-\n00428\n-ADA and\n20\n-cv-\n00078\n-ADA) finding that ecobee infringed\none\nof the\ntwo\npatents at issue and awarded a lump-sum payment of $\n5.4\nmillion for past and future damages.

The complaint asserts claims for alleged violation of federal securities law related to statements concerning the Company’s financial outlook and the impact of macroeconomic trends on the demand for its products.

The Company disputes the allegations in the shareholder derivative action and intends to vigorously defend against the claims in the complaint.\nIn the opinion of management, it is presently unlikely that any legal or regulatory proceedings pending against or involving the Company will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, in many of these matters, it is inherently difficult to determine whether a loss is probable or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss given the variety and potential outcomes of actual and potential claims, the uncertainty of future rulings, the behavior or incentives of adverse parties, and other factors outside the control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company’s loss reserves\nmay\nchange from time to time, and actual losses could exceed the amounts reserved by an amount that could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.\n69\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023,\n2022\nand\n2021\n:\n70"

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in this report on Form 10-K has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nInternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error or the circumvention or overriding of the controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its objective. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate, because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the criteria established in the 2013\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework\n, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n(PCAOB ID No.\n34\n), the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n71"
