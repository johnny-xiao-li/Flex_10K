    "text": "HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION\nHistory\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (herein referred to as “Northrop Grumman,” the “company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leading global aerospace and defense technology company. We deliver a broad range of products, services and solutions to U.S. and international customers, and principally to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and intelligence community. Our broad portfolio is aligned to support national security priorities and our solutions equip our customers with capabilities they need to connect, protect and advance humanity.\nThe company is a leading provider of space systems, military aircraft, missile defense, advanced weapons and long-range fires capabilities, mission systems, networking and communications, strategic deterrence systems, and breakthrough technologies, such as advanced computing, microelectronics and cyber. We are focused on competing and winning programs that enable continued growth, performing on our commitments and affordably delivering capability our customers need. With the investments we've made in advanced technologies, combined with our talented workforce and digital transformation capabilities, Northrop Grumman is well positioned to meet our customers' needs today and in the future. For a discussion of risks associated with our operations, see\n“\nRisk Factors.\n”\nThe company originally was formed in 1939 in Hawthorne, California as Northrop Aircraft Incorporated and was reincorporated in Delaware in 1985, as Northrop Corporation. Northrop Corporation was a principal developer of flying wing technology, including the B-2 Spirit stealth aircraft. We developed into one of the largest defense technology companies in the world through a series of acquisitions, as well as organic growth, including the following:\n•\n1994 - Acquired Grumman Corporation, a premier military aircraft systems integrator. The combined company was renamed Northrop Grumman Corporation;\n•\n1996 - Acquired the defense and electronics businesses of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, developer of sophisticated radar and other electronics systems;\n•\n2001 - Acquired Litton Industries, Inc., a global electronics and information technology company and full service shipbuilder;\n•\n2001 - Acquired Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., designer and builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines;\n•\n2002 - Acquired TRW Inc., developer of military and civil space systems and payloads, and integrator of complex, mission-enabling systems and services;\n•\n2011 - Completed the spin-off of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc., operator of our former shipbuilding business, comprised largely of a part of Litton Industries and Newport News Shipbuilding;\n•\n2018 - Acquired Orbital ATK, Inc. (OATK), developer and producer of satellites and other space systems, launch vehicles and missile products; and\n•\n2021 - Completed the sale of our IT and mission support services business (the “IT services divestiture”) to Veritas Capital.\nOrganization\nFrom time to time, we acquire or dispose of businesses and realign contracts, programs or businesses among and within our operating segments. Internal realignments are typically designed to leverage existing capabilities more fully and to enhance efficient development and delivery of products and services. At December 31, 2023, the company was aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems.\nAERONAUTICS SYSTEMS\nAeronautics Systems is a leader in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of military aircraft systems for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, other U.S. government agencies, and international customers.

Sales to the U.S. government accounted for 86 percent, 86 percent and 85 percent of sales during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For further information on sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to customer concentration.\nCOMPETITIVE CONDITIONS\nWe compete with many companies in the defense, intelligence and federal civil markets. The Boeing Company, General Dynamics, L3Harris Technologies, Lockheed Martin, and RTX are some of our primary competitors. Key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition, which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the number of competitor protests of U.S. government procurement awards.\nIt is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor, serve as a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa.\nSEASONALITY\nNo material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.\nBACKLOG\nAt December 31, 2023, total backlog, which is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations, was $84.2 billion as compared with $78.7 billion at December 31, 2022. For further information, see “Backlog” in\n-4-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A) and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe routinely apply for and own a number of U.S. and foreign patents related to the technologies we develop. We also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to third parties and we license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property from third parties. The U.S. government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property.\nRAW MATERIALS\nWe have experienced challenges with access to certain raw materials due to macroeconomic factors and several global events such as inflation, geopolitical conflicts and microelectronics shortages. In some cases, these challenges have significantly increased the cost and/or lead time required to obtain certain raw materials. Nonetheless, these challenges have not to date materially impacted our ability to perform on our contracts. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nFostering a culture that offers employees opportunities to live our values, deliver for our customers, and act responsibly and sustainably is central to our diverse and talented workforce. Our culture and values enable us to continue attracting qualified talent, particularly those with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas, including science, technology, engineering and math. This focus on our culture and workforce was a factor in our ability to hire approximately 14,500 new employees in 2023, and as of December 31, 2023, we have approximately 101,000 employees.\nAdditional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Report, which can be found on our company website. Information on our website, including our ESG Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\nOur Values and Culture\nOur values reflect our priorities and form the bedrock of our culture:\n•\nWe do the right thing – we earn trust, act with ethics, integrity and transparency, treat everyone with respect, value diversity and foster safe and inclusive environments.\n•\nWe do what we promise – we own the delivery of results, focused on quality.\n•\nWe commit to shared success – we work together to focus on the mission and take accountability for the sustainable success of our people, customers, shareholders, suppliers and communities.\n•\nWe pioneer – with fierce curiosity, dedication and innovation, we seek to solve the world’s most challenging problems.\nWe believe our culture and values are vital to the ongoing success of the company, including our ability to attract and retain a talented and diverse workforce. Our values are also integral to our commitment to long-term sustainability, with robust ESG practices across our company. The company has a Standards of Business Conduct program. Our employees are empowered to raise concerns without fear of reprisal. In addition to full-time ethics professionals, we also have over 150 business conduct advisors who promote values and an ethical culture within the company.\nOur annual Employee Experience Survey gives employees a voice and a mechanism to provide feedback on our culture and empower our leaders to enhance the employee experience. This anonymous survey encourages employee candor on key engagement and inclusion drivers, including belonging, respect, a sense of personal work accomplishment and recommending the company to others. In 2023, 81 percent of employees responded to the survey, an indication that our employees believe their feedback matters, and our survey results exceeded many of the global norms of our third party vendor for both engagement and inclusion. Our leaders review the survey responses and work collaboratively with their teams to take meaningful actions based on survey results.\n-5-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe value diversity and belonging in its broadest sense, as an enabling force that helps us pioneer, perform and deliver on quality, which results in value for our shareholders, customers, and employees. Across our U.S. employee population, as of December 31, 2023, 25 percent are female, 38 percent are people of color, 18 percent are veterans and 8 percent are persons with disabilities. At the vice president level, 35 percent are female and 20 percent are people of color. We strive to reach all parts of the diverse talent pools available now and in the future because we recognize that we benefit from having coworkers with different ideas, perspectives and approaches to help us innovate.\nTalent Management\nNorthrop Grumman’s talent strategy is focused on four key pillars: broadening talent pools; enhancing the employee experience; building leaders of the future; and enabling new ways of working. Our strategy addresses the external and internal landscape and ensures that we are able to attract, retain and develop the workforce necessary to support the continued success of the business.\nWe hold regular talent review discussions to ensure line of sight to talent at various levels of the organization. Succession plans are refreshed and reviewed to ensure a robust, diverse pipeline of talent and business continuity with a tight linkage to development. We focus on accelerating learning and development of our leaders by providing a combination of experiences, exposure and education.\nOur employee development programs strengthen employee skills aligned to our current and future business needs through on-the-job development, knowledge sharing and tools to support career growth. Employees utilize curated, career-specific resources such as My Learning Experience, a machine learning enabled content aggregator that creates a personalized learning experience for each employee. Our Education Assistance Program subsidizes tuition and other educational institution fees to support development through job-related degrees and certificates. Our early-in-career rotation program, Pathways, develops talent pipelines with both depth of critical skills and breadth of experiences. Our technical cohort programs cultivate technical, domain expertise and collaborative thought leadership for early through advanced career levels.\nIn a rapidly changing world, we maintain focus on keeping our team and our company prepared for the evolving future of work. In addition to offering our employees flexible work arrangements, caregiver support and mental health services that help our employees make their careers work within their lives, we also help our employees build the careers that will serve them into the future. We ensure that our employees have the tools and resources to develop their knowledge base and skill sets, so that they can continue to thrive at Northrop Grumman even in the midst of change. When our employees succeed and grow at work, our business succeeds and grows. Through a focus on our employees, we remain agile and innovative, adapting to the future as it unfolds before us. We provide many avenues for our employees to feel included, so we can hire, develop and retain the best people to support our common mission and better pioneer together.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nHealth and safety are a core focus in everything we do. People are our most valuable resource, and our goals have been, and continue to be, to keep our employees safe and position the company for long-term success.\nRisk and hazard identification, abatement and prevention are key components of Northrop Grumman’s safety program. Everyone has a responsibility to identify workplace hazards and we empower employees to report these hazards without fear of repercussion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our health and safety programs externally, through benchmarking with industry peers and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Internally, we determine program effectiveness by conducting trend analyses of our past performance.\nCollective Agreements\nApproximately 4,100 employees are covered by 15 collective agreements in the U.S., of which we negotiated one renewal in 2023 and expect to negotiate five renewals in 2024.\nSee “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to our workforce and employee relations.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nGovernment Contract Security Restrictions\nWe are prohibited by the U.S. government from publicly discussing the details of certain classified programs. These programs are generally referred to as “restricted” in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements and financial information in this Annual Report reflect the operating results of our entire company, including restricted programs.\n-6-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nContracts\nWe generate the majority of our business from long-term contracts with the U.S. government for development, production and support activities. Unless otherwise specified in a contract, allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the U.S. government pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which are regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts. Examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the U.S. government in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements include, but are not limited to, unallowable employee compensation, charitable donations, interest expense, advertising, and certain legal and travel costs.\nWe monitor our contracts on a regular basis for compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable government laws and regulations. In addition, costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. government are routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA).\nOur long-term contracts typically fall into one of two contract types:\nCost-type contracts\n– Cost-type contracts include cost plus fixed fee, cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts. Cost-type contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee. As a result, cost-type contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation. Fees on cost-type contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or can be variable due to award and incentive fees, which are generally based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality and/or technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company’s performance against contractual criteria. Incentive fees are generally based on cost or schedule and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs or as schedule milestones are met. Award and incentive fees are included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.\nFixed-price contracts\n– Firm fixed-price contracts include a specified scope of work for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated amount and not typically subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor, absent changes by the customer. As a result, fixed-price contracts typically have more financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth, but provide the opportunity for higher profit margins. Certain fixed-price incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount, typically through a cost-sharing ratio that affects profitability. These contracts effectively become firm fixed-price contracts once the cost-share ceiling is reached. Time-and-materials contracts are considered fixed-price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged.\nProfit margins on our contracts may vary materially depending on, among other things, the contract type, contract phase (e.g., development, low-rate production or mature production), negotiated fee arrangements, achievement of performance objectives, unexpected macroeconomic factors or other circumstances, and cost, schedule and technical performance.\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and “Risk Factors” for further information regarding our contracts and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for sales by contract type.\n-7-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe following table summarizes sales for the year ended December 31, 2023, recognized by contract type and customer category:\n(1)\nSales to the U.S. government include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. government. Each of the company’s segments derives substantial revenue from the U.S. government.\n(2)\nInternational sales include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is an international customer. These sales include foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. government.\nEnvironmental\nOur operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and enforcement actions relating to protection of the environment. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our environmental sustainability commitments. See “Risk Factors” and Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding environmental matters.\nIn 2022, we announced our next generation environmental sustainability goals, and in 2023, we announced our goals for water and waste. These goals focus on Northrop Grumman’s facilities in addition to supply chain partners and customers:\n•\nNet zero greenhouse gas emissions in operations by 2035;\n•\nSource 50 percent of total electricity from renewable sources by 2030;\n•\nReduce 10% of absolute water withdrawals, reuse 10% of water withdrawals and replenish 10% of water withdrawals, focusing in water-stressed regions — all by 2030;\n•\nReduce solid waste sent to landfill and incineration by 10% by 2030;\n•\nIn collaboration with key customers, work to develop a pioneering product stewardship program focused on material efficiency, product design and life cycle assessment;\n•\nExpand Technology for Conservation initiatives in proximity to Northrop Grumman's U.S. locations by 2030, in collaboration with external partners.\nAdditional information regarding our environmental sustainability goals is available in our ESG Report, which can be found on our company website.\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nSee “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for information about our executive officers.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur principal executive offices are located at 2980 Fairview Park Drive, Falls Church, Virginia 22042.

    "text": "Our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\n•\nWe depend heavily on a single customer, the U.S. government, for a substantial portion of our business. Changes in this customer’s priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur primary customer is the U.S. government, from which we derived 86 percent of our sales in 2023; we have a number of large programs with the U.S. Department of the Air Force, in particular. The U.S. government has the ability to delay, modify or cancel ongoing competitions, procurements and programs, as well as to change its future acquisition strategy. We cannot predict the impact on existing, follow-on, replacement or future programs from potential changes in the threat and global security environment, defense spending levels, government and budgetary priorities, political leadership, procurement practices and strategy, inflation and other macroeconomic trends, military strategy; or broader changes in social, economic, security or political demands and priorities.\nThe U.S. government has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, for its convenience or for default based on performance. In the event of termination for convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned. In the event of termination due to default, contractors may be required to pay for re-procurement costs in excess of the original contract price, net of the value of work accepted from the original contract, as well as other damages. Termination due to our default (or that of a teammate) could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWhere program cost estimates exceed certain thresholds, our customer has been, and may in the future be, required to provide congressional notification of significant or critical cost increases (or breaches) under the Nunn-McCurdy Act, which, in some circumstances, could result in program restructure or termination. For example, in January 2024 the customer provided congressional notification that the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (“Sentinel”) program is currently under a Nunn-McCurdy breach review.\nThe U.S. government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience. The U.S. government has invoked and could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts. In the event of a stop work order, contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work plus a reasonable fee. However, such temporary stoppages often introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which contractors may not be able to negotiate full recovery. In some cases, they have also ultimately resulted and could result in termination of a contract for convenience or reduced future orders.\nA significant shift in government priorities, programs or strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nSignificant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and U.S. government funding more broadly, including a prolonged continuing resolution or breach of the debt ceiling, can negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nU.S. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. For many programs, Congress appropriates funds annually even though the program performance period may extend over several years. Programs are often partially funded initially, with additional funds committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. When we or our subcontractors incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we are generally at risk for reimbursement unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract. We cannot\n-9-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\npredict what funding will ultimately be approved for individual programs. In addition, pressures on, as well as laws and plans relating to the federal budget, potential changes in priorities and defense spending, the timing and substance of the appropriations process, use of continuing resolutions (with restrictions, e.g., on new starts) and the federal debt limit (including a breach of the federal debt ceiling), have adversely affected and could adversely affect the amount and timing of funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payments by our customers. In the event government funding for our significant programs is reduced, delayed or unavailable, or orders are reduced, our contracts or subcontracts, or competitions for such programs have at times been, and in the future may be, terminated or changed.\nThe U.S. continues to face an uncertain and changing political environment, along with substantial fiscal, economic and security challenges, which affect funding and budgetary priorities. The budget and macroeconomic environment, global security environment, political instability, and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes and the debt ceiling, remain significant short and long-term risks. See “Overview” in MD&A. In addition, high deficit levels and high debt servicing costs could drive cuts to federal spending. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold. If annual appropriations bills are not timely enacted, the U.S. government may continue to operate under a continuing resolution (potentially of extended duration), restricting new contract or program starts, presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on budgets. We also may face a prolonged government shutdown that could lead to program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders and could limit the U.S. government’s ability to progress programs and make timely payments. A prolonged shutdown could limit our ability to perform on our contracts and successfully compete for new work. If the statutory debt limit is not increased adequately, we could be obligated to work without receiving timely payments, and a prolonged breach could have far-reaching adverse consequences. If current macroeconomic pressures (especially from inflation and labor and supply chain challenges) are prolonged or worsen, and increased costs continue, then existing or anticipated appropriated and contracted funds may not be sufficient to cover costs incurred on existing or future programs.\nFuture funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced, delayed or cancelled. Budget cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers. While we believe that our business is well-positioned in areas for future defense spending, changing priorities, budget pressures, defense spending cuts, challenges in the appropriations process, the possibility of a long-term continuing resolution (or series of continuing resolutions) and breach of the debt ceiling, ongoing fiscal debates and the global economic and security environment increase uncertainties and risk.\nSignificant delays or reductions in appropriations for our current and future programs; long-term funding under a continuing resolution; an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown; and/or future budget and program decisions, among other items, may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nWe use estimates when accounting for contracts. Contract cost growth or changes in estimated contract revenues and costs can affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\nContract accounting requires judgment, including in assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and predicting future performance. Given the size and nature of our many contracts, estimating total revenues and costs at completion is complex and subject to many variables. When there is sufficient information to assess expected future performance, we consider performance related incentives, awards and penalties in estimating revenue and profit rates. Suppliers’ expected performance, and the availability and costs of labor, materials and components, are also considered.\nOur operating income can be adversely affected when estimated contract costs increase, especially without comparable increases in revenue. There are many reasons estimated contract costs can increase, including inflation, labor challenges, supply chain challenges, and market and exchange rate volatility; delays or limitations in customer funding; design or other development challenges; production challenges (including from technical or quality issues and other performance concerns); inability to realize learning curves or other cost savings; changes in laws or regulations; actions necessary for long-term customer satisfaction; challenges caused by the global health environment; and natural disasters or environmental matters.\nWe aim to mitigate this risk through contract terms, and we have submitted and may submit requests for equitable adjustment (REAs), engineering change proposals or other claims to seek recovery in whole or in part for our increased costs. We have also sought, and will seek, other avenues, as appropriate, to compensate the company for certain unexpected cost increases. However, our contracts may not enable full recovery, and/or the government may disagree with our requests and may not have funding to cover them.\n-10-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nOur risk varies with the type of contract. Fixed-price contracts inherently tend to have more financial risk than cost-type contracts, including as a result of inflationary pressures, labor rates and shortages, and supplier challenges. In 2023, approximately half of our sales were derived from fixed-price contracts. We have more often entered into fixed-price contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on actual experience, such as for mature production programs. However, our customers have sought, and may in the future seek, fixed-price contracts for development programs, combined development and production programs, or low-rate initial production programs, where the risks are greater. In addition, our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights. If we do not achieve our estimates or meet terms in our contracts, our profitability has at times been and may be reduced, and we have incurred and may incur losses.\nCertain of our fixed-price contracts include or may include fixed-price development work. This work is inherently more uncertain, and, as a result, there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage. As work progresses into production, the risks associated with estimating total costs are typically reduced. While management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixed-price contracts, future events could result in significant adjustments.\nUnder cost-type contracts, allowable costs are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee. We often enter into cost-type contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs may have award or incentive fees that are uncertain and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract. In these cases, the financial risks are typically in recognizing profit, which ultimately may not be earned, or program cancellation if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues arise. We also face additional financial risk when solicitations require us to bid on cost-type development work and fixed-price production lots and/or options in one submission, or cost-type development work requiring us to provide certain items at our expense or with little or no fee. Ongoing macroeconomic challenges increase these risks.\nBecause of the significance of management’s judgments and the estimation processes, and the difficulties inherent in estimating future costs, particularly in a challenging macroeconomic environment, it is possible that we could see materially different results. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates, and the failure to recover on requests for equitable adjustments, engineering change proposals or other claims could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of one or more of our contracts and on our overall financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in MD&A and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\n•\nThe global macroeconomic environment could negatively impact our business and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the global macroeconomic environment, which has experienced extraordinary challenges, including high rates of inflation; increased interest rates; widespread disruptions in supply chains; workforce challenges, including labor shortages; and market volatility, including exchange rate volatility. These challenges have, among other things, led to increased costs, labor and supply shortages, and delays and disruption in performance, as well as competing demands for scarce resources. Those challenges have adversely impacted our customers, our industry, our company, our suppliers and others with whom we do business. While some aspects of the macroeconomic environment have improved, and we have been able to mitigate some of the challenges (especially with respect to labor shortages), other challenges persist. We cannot predict the future trajectory or duration of this risk, including how the macroeconomic environment will evolve or how it will continue to impact us.\nWe continue to work proactively to mitigate the challenges caused by the macroeconomic environment, including, in some cases, seeking the inclusion of economic price adjustment clauses or seeking to recover on requests for equitable adjustments, engineering change proposals or other claims. However, if we are unable to do so successfully, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n•\nCompetition within our markets and bid protests may affect our ability to win new contracts and result in reduced revenues and market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more financial capacity or more extensive or specialized engineering, manufacturing, marketing or servicing capabilities. They may be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts. We have seen, and anticipate we will continue to see, increased competition in some of our core markets, especially as a result of our customers’ budget pressures, their focus on affordability and competition, and our own success in winning business. We are facing increasing competition in the U.S. and outside the U.S. from U.S., foreign and multinational firms, including new entrants, and anticipate that acquisitions within our industry could further increase competition. We are also facing increasing competition for,\n-11-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nand more limited access to various critical products, services and other supplies. In some instances, foreign companies may receive loans, subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to U.S. companies and foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer. Some customers, including the DoD, are turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for some products and services, and continue to utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally. Our success in competing depends, in part, on our ability to remain cost-competitive, accurately anticipate our customers’ needs and successfully to effect our digital transformation strategy and adopt and integrate new digital manufacturing and operating technologies into our products and services.\nBid protests can result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in such a loss, it can delay the start of contract activities and earnings.\nIf we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, or prevail in protests, or to prevail against other attempts to interfere with our ability to obtain and retain awards, we may experience declines in future revenues and market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n•\nWe are subject to various investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, and other legal proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us particularly susceptible to investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, prosecutions, litigation and other legal proceedings (collectively “legal proceedings”), particularly those involving governments, which have at times been, and may continue to be, increasingly aggressive. We are and may become subject to legal proceedings globally (including criminal, civil and administrative) and across a broad array of matters, including, but not limited to, government contracts, cost accounting, financial accounting and reporting, false statements or claims, cybersecurity and pension accounting and other employee benefit plan matters. These matters can divert resources; result in administrative, civil or criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions (including judgments, convictions, consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements), compensatory, treble or other damages, non-monetary relief, or other liabilities; and otherwise harm our business and our ability to obtain and retain awards. Certain allegations may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export/import privileges for the company or one or more of its components. Suspension or debarment or criminal resolutions in particular could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations. An investigation, claim, dispute, enforcement action or litigation, even if pending or not ultimately substantiated or if fully indemnified or insured, can negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it substantially more difficult for us to compete effectively for business, obtain and retain awards, ensure adequate funding for our programs or obtain adequate insurance in the future. Investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding investigations, claims and litigation.\n•\nThe improper conduct of employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners or joint ventures in which we participate can impact our reputation, our ability to do business and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe have implemented policies, training and other compliance controls, and have negotiated contractual terms designed to prevent misconduct by employees, agents or others working with us or on our behalf that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing improper payments to government officials, the protection of export controlled or classified information, false claims, procurement integrity, cost accounting and billing, competition, information security and data privacy, intellectual property and contract terms. However, we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees, agents, suppliers, partners or others working with us or on our behalf. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such misconduct, despite a vigorous compliance program, our values and strong culture. This risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to expand globally, with greater opportunities and demands to do more business with local and new partners, and in new environments. At the same time, law enforcement agencies are continuing to focus collaboratively on combating global corruption and other misconduct. In the ordinary course we form and are members of joint ventures or other business arrangements and/or invest in third parties with whom we do business. Notwithstanding our robust processes, we may be unable to prevent misconduct or violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures (including their officers, directors and employees) or our\n-12-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\npartners. Improper actions by our employees or those with whom or through whom we do business subjects us to risk of administrative, civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions; monetary and non-monetary penalties; liabilities; and the loss of privileges and other sanctions, including suspension and debarment, which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we and our partners are subject to various procurement and other laws, regulations and contract terms applicable to our industry, as well as those more broadly applicable to industry, and we could be adversely affected by changes in such laws, regulations or terms, or any negative findings by the U.S. government as to our compliance with them. We also may be adversely affected by changes in our customers’ business practices globally.\nU.S. government contractors (including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business) must comply with various specific procurement laws, regulations, rules and other legal requirements, as well as ones more broadly applicable. These various legal requirements, although sometimes customary in government contracting, increase costs and risks. They have been and are evolving at a significant pace. The costs are not always fully recoverable. New laws or other requirements, or changes to existing ones (including, for example, related to cyber, information protection, cost accounting, environment, sustainability, securities, competition, compensation costs, taxes, counterfeit parts, pensions, and use of certain non-US equipment) or more expansive interpretations or other changes in how government agencies construe existing ones, can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the DCAA, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the DoD Inspector General. These agencies review performance under our contracts, our cost structure and accounting, and our compliance, and the adequacy of our systems in meeting government requirements. Costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated may not be reimbursed or may be refunded. When an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we are subject to possible civil and criminal penalties, sanctions, or suspension or debarment. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems to be inadequate, with significant financial impact, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, we risk serious reputational harm in situations involving allegations of impropriety made against us or our business partners.\nOur industry has experienced, and we expect it will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices globally, in part as a result of changes in the global security and threat environment and an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies, business systems, recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds. We have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits and challenges to our claims and our business systems for current and past years, as well as longer periods to close audits, broader requests for information and an increased risk of withholdings of payments. The U.S. government has been pursuing and may continue to pursue policies that could negatively impact our profitability, including those that shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor. Changes in procurement practices, including those favoring incentive-based fee arrangements; fixed price development or long-term production programs; different award criteria; non-traditional contract provisions; and contract negotiation offers that indicate what our costs should be, have affected and may in the future affect our profitability and predictability.\nWe (including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business) also are subject to, and expected to perform in compliance with, a vast array of federal, state and local laws, regulations, contract terms and requirements related to our industry, our products and the businesses we operate, as well as those more broadly applicable to industry, such as securities laws and regulations. These requirements, whether specific to our industry or broadly applicable, may limit our ability to achieve our goals. If we are found to have violated any such requirements, or are found not to have acted responsibly, we may be subject to a wide array of actions, including contract modifications or termination; payment withholds; the loss of export/import privileges; administrative, civil or criminal judgments or penalties (including convictions, agreements, fines, damages and non-monetary relief); or suspension or debarment.\nIf we or those with whom we do business do not comply with the laws, regulations, rules, contract terms and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices or requirements change significantly, including with respect to allowable costs, it could affect our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n-13-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n•\nEnvironmental matters, including climate change, unforeseen costs associated with compliance and remediation efforts, and government and third party claims, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including as they may be expanded, otherwise changed or enforced differently over time. Compliance with these existing and evolving environmental laws and regulations requires, and is expected to continue to require, significant operating and capital costs. For example, some of these recently enacted laws and regulations prohibit the use of certain chemicals or other substances that are used in our business, which may require us to identify alternate sources, result in additional costs and/or otherwise impact our business and operations. New and evolving laws, regulations and rule makings globally are expected to impose different and more restrictive standards and require greater disclosures. They could also require capital investments, could adversely impact our ongoing operations, and could require changes on a more accelerated time frame. Our suppliers are expected to face similar challenges and incur additional compliance costs that may be passed on to us. These direct and indirect costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, and, if we are unable to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements or meet our sustainability objectives, our reputation and ability to do business could be negatively impacted. In addition, our customers’ requirements, priorities and ways of doing business with respect to environmental matters, and climate change specifically, also may have an impact on our business, operations and financial success. For example, in 2022, the SEC and FAR council issued proposed rule-makings on climate change. The proposed rules, depending on how they are finally adopted, as well as other changes the government might implement, could impose significant new burdens on the company and our suppliers, with significant potential costs and operational impacts, and adversely impact our ability to win business and operate successfully.\nEnvironmental matters may significantly impact our business and operations and present evolving risks and challenges. Environmental impacts, including climate change specifically, create short and long-term financial risks to our business globally. We have significant operations located in regions that have been, and may in the future be, exposed to significant weather events and other natural disasters. Increased worldwide focus on climate change has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to combat both potential causes and adverse impacts of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. New or more stringent laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change related concerns have affected and will likely continue to affect us, our suppliers and our customers. The company has set a goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 2035 and is committed to working to achieve its climate change and other sustainability goals. We are working to identify opportunities to utilize alternatives to fossil-based energy sources, to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce our consumption of water and generation of waste, and to ensure our compliance with environmental regulations where we operate, enhancing our record of environmental sustainability. However, the costs of doing so may be greater than expected, and there can be no assurance the company will achieve its objectives, or meet the evolving sustainability expectations and standards of our investors and other external stakeholders.\nWe may be subject to substantial administrative, civil or criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions (including suspension and debarment) for violations of environmental laws. If we are found to be in violation of the Federal Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the Environmental Protection Agency on a list of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on U.S. government contracts until the violation is corrected.\nWe incur, and expect to continue to incur, substantial remediation costs related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. Stricter or different remediation standards or enforcement of existing laws and regulations; new requirements, including regulation of new substances; discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination or new contaminants; imposition of fines, penalties, or damages (including natural resource damages); a determination that certain remediation or other costs are unallowable; rulings on allocation or insurance coverage; and/or the insolvency, inability or unwillingness of other parties to pay their share, could require us to incur material additional costs in excess of those anticipated.\nWe are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes involving government and private parties (including individual and class actions) relating to alleged impacts from pollutants released into the environment, including bodily injury and property damage. These matters could result in material compensatory or other damages, remediation costs, penalties, and non-monetary relief, and adverse determinations on allowability or insurance coverage.\n-14-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nGovernment and private parties also seek to hold us responsible for liabilities or obligations related to former operations that have been divested or spun-off and/or for which we believe other parties have agreed to be responsible and/or to indemnify us. These rights may not be sufficient to protect us.\nThe impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could harm our reputation and business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, have affected and could affect our tax expense. In addition, the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation, in particular with regard to our positions on research credits and timing of revenue recognition under IRC Section 451(b), could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nWe may be subject to future tax audits and legal challenges involving OATK, which we acquired in 2018, or the spinoff of its then subsidiary Vista Outdoor, and we may be unable to obtain indemnification or we may be required to indemnify Vista.\nChanges in our tax provisions or an increase in our tax liabilities, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations, the interpretation or application thereof, or a final determination of tax audits or litigation or agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n•\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions.\nAs a defense contractor, we face significant cyber and other security threats. They include, among other things, attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or otherwise compromise the integrity, confidentiality and/or availability of our systems, hardware and networks, and the information on them; insider threats; ransomware; threats to the safety of our directors, officers and employees; threats to our facilities, infrastructure, products (we produce and use), and subcontractors or other suppliers (referred to inclusively as suppliers); and threats from terrorist acts, espionage, civil unrest and other acts of aggression. We are also subject to increasing government, customer and other cyber and security requirements, including disclosure obligations.\nWe have robust measures in place to address and mitigate cyber-related risks. However, we have experienced cyber attacks and expect we will continue to experience additional attacks in the future, including from nation states and non-state actors. We continue to invest in the cybersecurity and resiliency of our networks and products and to enhance our internal controls and processes, which are designed to help protect our systems and infrastructure, and the information they contain. These include timely detection of incidents through monitoring, training, incident response capabilities, and mitigating cyber and security risks to our data, systems, products and services. We also partner with the government and others in our industry to help protect national security. However, given the complex, continuing and evolving nature of cyber and other security threats, including threats from targeting by more advanced and persistent adversaries, including nation states and other actors, these efforts may not be fully effective, particularly against previously unknown vulnerabilities that could go undetected for an extended period.\nOur customers and partners (including our suppliers and joint ventures) to whom we entrust confidential data, and on whom we rely to provide products and services, face similar threats and growing requirements, including ones for which others may seek to hold us responsible. We depend on our customers, suppliers, and other business partners to implement and verify adequate controls and safeguards to protect against and report cyber incidents. If they fail to deter, detect or report cyber incidents in a timely manner, we may suffer financial and other harm, including to our information, operations, performance, employees and reputation.\nAlthough we implement various measures and controls to monitor and mitigate risks associated with these threats and to increase the cyber resiliency of our infrastructure and products, there can be no assurance that these processes will be sufficient. Successful attacks could lead to losses or misuse of sensitive information or capabilities; theft or corruption of data; harm to personnel, infrastructure or products; financial costs and liabilities; protracted disruptions in our operations and performance; and the misuse of our products, as well as damage to our reputation as a provider of cyber-related or cyber-protected goods and services. We have not always been able to and may in the future not always be able to obtain adequate insurance to cover our losses.\nCyber threats, both on premises and in the cloud, are evolving and include, but are not limited to: malicious software, destructive malware, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems or data, disruption to\n-15-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\noperations, critical systems or denial of service attacks; unauthorized release of confidential, personal or other protected information (ours or that of our employees, customers or partners); corruption of data, networks or systems; harm to individuals; and loss of assets. We have been and could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products or services we use or in our internal, partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with our business. Some of these threats are zero-day attacks associated with previously unknown vulnerabilities in third party software or products we utilize in our business. Cyber events, if not prevented or effectively mitigated, have caused and could cause harm and require remedial actions. They could also damage our reputation, disrupt performance, impact our ability to obtain future insurance coverage, and lead to loss of business, regulatory actions, liabilities or other financial losses, for which we do not have adequate sources of recovery.\nWe provide systems, products and services to various customers who also face cyber threats. Our systems, products and services may not be able to detect or deter threats, or effectively to mitigate resulting losses. These losses could adversely affect our customers and our company.\nWe also face increasing and evolving disclosure obligations related to cyber and other security events. Despite rigorous processes, we risk failing to meet all our existing or future disclosure obligations and/or having our disclosures misinterpreted. National security or public safety considerations may also affect, or in limited instances prevent, our public disclosure of a cybersecurity incident in certain circumstances.\nWe also face threats to our physical security, including to our facilities and the safety and well-being of our people. These threats could involve terrorism, insider threats, workplace violence, civil unrest, natural disasters, damaging weather, or fires, which could adversely affect our company. Our customers and suppliers face similar risks that, if realized, could also adversely impact our operations. Such acts could cause delays, manufacturing downtime, or other impacts that could detrimentally impact our ability to perform our operations. We could also incur unanticipated costs to remediate impacts and lost business.\nThe occurrence and impact of these various risks are difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nOur ability to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce.\nOur operating results and growth opportunities are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified and diverse personnel who are or can reasonably be cleared (and obtain program access), who have the requisite skills in multiple areas, including science, technology, engineering and math, and who share our values and are able to operate effectively consistent with our culture. Outside the U.S., it is increasingly important that we are also able to attract and retain personnel with relevant local qualifications and experience. We continue to face increased competition for talent, both with traditional defense companies and commercial companies, globally, and with increasing wage rates. Although we have realized benefits from extensive hiring and retention programs in recent years, the risk of insufficient personnel may increase, either broadly or with respect to select critical staffing requirements.\nIf necessary qualified personnel are more scarce or more difficult to attract or retain under reasonable terms, or if we experience a high level of attrition, generally or in particular areas, or if such personnel are increasingly unable to obtain security clearances or program access on a timely basis or are unable to be timely and effectively trained, we would expect higher labor-related costs and we could face challenges performing on various of our programs and meeting financial expectations. In addition, the macroeconomic environment, including continued challenges in the global labor market, may further affect our ability to hire, develop and retain the necessary talented and diverse workforce, and to maintain performance levels and our corporate culture. There is also the risk that we are unable to achieve our environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals which may be required by certain of our shareholders, employees, the government and other stakeholders, which could adversely impact our reputation, business and ability to hire and retain talent.\nCertain of our employees are covered by collective agreements. We generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities. However, the environment appears to be shifting, and if, for example, we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements, or if our employees pursue new collective representation, we could incur additional expenses and impacts on operating efficiency and may be subject to work stoppages or other labor-related disruptions. Any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our performance and results.\n-16-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nIf we are unable to attract and retain a qualified workforce, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position or achieve our results, and it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nOur earnings and profitability depend, in part, on subcontractor and supplier performance and financial viability as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.\nWe rely on other companies to provide raw materials, chemicals, parts and components and subsystems for our products, produce hardware elements and sub-assemblies, provide software and intellectual property, provide information about the parts they supply to us, and perform some of the services we need for our operations or provide to our customers, and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and contract terms, while maintaining strong values and cultures. Disruptions or performance problems with our subcontractors or other suppliers (referred to inclusively as suppliers), unanticipated cost growth for the products and services they provide, failure to meet regulatory or contractual requirements, unethical behavior, or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our suppliers, have had and may continue to have various adverse impacts on the company, including on our ability to meet our commitments to customers and financial expectations. This risk of delays and disruptions in the supply chain, and supply chain challenges more broadly, has been and continues to be heightened globally, in the current macroeconomic environment.\nOur ability to perform our obligations on time is adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon products, materials or information, or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely, compliant and cost-effective manner. We also may experience challenges performing if we are unable to use certain raw materials, chemicals or other substances due to laws or other regulations that restrict or prohibit the use of such items and cannot obtain a reasonable substitute on a cost-effective basis. Changes in political or economic conditions, including changes in demand, changes in the macroeconomic environment (including inflation and labor and supply chain challenges), changes in defense budgets and/or priorities, changes in the global security environment, changes in export/import restrictions, evolving requirements, or changes in access to critical technology and materials (including metals and components), among others, have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect the financial stability of our suppliers and/or their ability to perform effectively. The inability of our suppliers to perform effectively has required and may require us to provide them additional support and/or to transition to alternate suppliers, if available, with additional costs and delays. We expect we will need to continue to provide additional resources to support certain of our suppliers in performing under our contracts. In addition, if we are unable to do that, we may face additional losses and liabilities under our current contracts and adversely impact the prospects for certain new ones.\nIn connection with our U.S. government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer and/or are restricted from procuring products or services from certain sources. For example, we require assured access to certain microelectronics. Our ability to produce and/or deliver products will be significantly impacted if the microelectronics manufacturing supply chain is cut off or significantly delayed. For some components, there has been or may be only one supplier, or one domestic supplier. If that supplier cannot meet our needs or if we are unable to procure components from certain suppliers due to regulatory restrictions, we may be unable to find a suitable alternative and to meet our obligations.\nWe and our suppliers are also facing increased regulatory requirements globally. We may be held responsible not only for our compliance, but that of our suppliers. Our procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk we procure counterfeit, unauthorized or otherwise non-compliant parts or materials. We rely on our suppliers also to comply with applicable laws and contract terms, to ensure the quality of their components and effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions to their performance.\nIf our suppliers are not financially viable, incur increased costs of delays, fail to comply with legal requirements, or otherwise fail to address these risks or meet their obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nOur international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, laws and regulations.\nSales to customers outside the U.S. are an important component of our strategy. Our international business (including our participation in joint ventures, requirements for local content, and our global supply chain) is subject to numerous political and economic factors, legal requirements, cross-cultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally. These risks differ in some respects from those associated with our U.S.\n-17-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nbusiness and our exposure to such risks is expected to increase if and as our international business continues to grow.\nOur international business is generally subject to both U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and practices. Failure by us, our employees, partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, commercial or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export/import privileges. Failure to comply with local practices can adversely impact our ability to win and perform business. New regulations and requirements, or changes to existing ones in countries in which we operate can significantly increase our costs and risks of doing business internationally. Our customers outside of the U.S. also often have the ability to terminate contracts for convenience as well as for default based on performance. Suspension or debarment, or termination of a contract due to default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Despite robust processes, we also face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products and resources.\nChanges in laws, political leadership and environment, and/or security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct profitable business in international markets. Our international business is impacted by changes in U.S. and non-U.S. national policies and priorities, and geopolitical relationships, any of which may be influenced by changes in the global threat environment, political leadership, geopolitical and economic uncertainties, world events, government budgets, inflationary pressures, sanctions imposed in countries where we do business or seek to do business, and economic and political factors more generally. The U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions, and diverse regional security concerns. Any of these factors may impact demand for our products and services, funding for programs, our ability to perform, our supply chain, export authorizations, purchasing decisions or customer payments. Global macroeconomic conditions, as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit, are also likely to further impact our business.\nOur contracts with non-U.S. customers in some cases include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks. They may include requirements to hire, invest, manufacture or purchase locally, or specific financial obligations, including offset obligations, and they may provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. They may also require us to enter into letters of credit, performance bonds, bank guarantees or other financial arrangements. If we are dependent on certain suppliers, as in the U.S., we face risks related to their failure to perform in accordance with legal requirements, particularly where we rely on a sole source supplier. Our ability to sell products globally could be adversely affected if we are unable to design our products on a cost effective basis or to obtain and retain all necessary export authorizations, which the U.S. government can deny, change or revoke for reasons outside our control. Our business outside of the U.S. also depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel with the skills and/or security clearances in the markets in which we do business. We may need to partner successfully with non-U.S. companies, including through joint ventures, teaming agreements, co-production or other arrangements. This risk includes the ability to identify and negotiate appropriate arrangements with qualified and acceptable local partners, potential exposure for their actions, and the ability effectively to terminate these arrangements. This risk is complicated further when we partner with government-affiliated entities.\nThe products and services we provide, including those provided by suppliers and joint ventures, are sometimes in countries with unstable governments, economic or fiscal challenges, military or political conflicts, different business practices and/or developing legal systems. This may increase the risk to our employees, suppliers or other third parties, including for their safety, and increase our risk to a wide range of financial consequences and other liabilities, as well as loss of property or damage to our products.\nThe occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe face a wide variety of risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, especially of infectious diseases. The global health environment has contributed to business slowdowns or shutdowns, labor shortages, supply chain challenges, changes in government spending and requirements, regulatory challenges, inflationary pressures and market volatility. Although we aim to mitigate impacts of adverse changes in the global health environment, these changes can be unpredictable and we may be unable to effectively mitigate them. If a health\n-18-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nepidemic, pandemic or similar outbreak were to occur or worsen, we likely would experience broad and varied impacts, including potentially to our workforce and supply chain, with inflationary pressures and increased costs (which may or may not be fully recoverable or insured), schedule and/or production delays, market volatility and other financial impacts. If any or all of these items were to occur, we could experience material adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to innovate, develop new products and technologies, progress and benefit from digital transformation and maintain technologies, facilities and equipment to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers. Failure to do so or meet our contractual obligations that require innovative design could adversely affect our profitability, reputation and future prospects.\nWe design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services, which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments, including highly demanding operating conditions, to accomplish challenging missions. Our success depends upon our ability to develop technologically advanced, innovative and cost-effective products and services and market these products and services to our customers globally. Our ability to develop innovative and technologically advanced products depends on the talent of our workforce, continued funding for, and investment in, research and development projects, continued access to assured suppliers of important technologies and components, our ability to compete (including with commercial companies) and our ability to provide the people, technologies, facilities, equipment and financial capacity needed to develop and deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency. To perform on our contracts and to win new business, we also depend increasingly on our ability to progress successfully on our digital transformation. It is increasingly necessary to meet evolving customer requirements, to differentiate our offerings, and to achieve efficiencies that we and our suppliers/partners successfully develop digital based solutions and transform our operations. If we are unable to continue to develop new products and technologies in a timely fashion, and progress successfully to effect digital solutions and transformation, or if we fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected.\nWe aim to ensure that our technical solutions are responsibly developed, tested and operated. Problems and delays in the successful development and delivery of our solutions, including as a result of issues with our design, technology or operations, digital transformation, inability to achieve learning curve assumptions, artificial intelligence, manufacturing materials or components, or subcontractor (or other supplier) performance can prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk and liabilities. Similarly, failures to perform on schedule or otherwise to fulfill our contractual obligations can negatively impact our financial position, reputation and ability to win future business.\nIn addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that can negatively affect revenue, schedule and profitability, and result in loss of life or property. They include loss on launch or flight of spacecraft, loss of aviation platforms, premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, unintended explosions, problems with design, quality and workmanship, country of origin of procured materials, inadequate supplier components and degradation of product performance. Factors that may affect revenue and profitability also include: inaccurate cost estimates, design issues, human factors, unforeseen costs and expenses, diversion of management focus, loss of follow-on work, replacement obligations, and repayment to the government customer of certain contract cost and fee payments previously received.\nCertain contracts, primarily involving space satellite systems, contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time. Under such terms, we are generally required to forfeit fees previously recognized and/or collected.\nIf we are unable to meet our obligations, including due to issues regarding the design, development or manufacture of our products or services, or we experience launch, platform, satellite system or other failures, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nOur business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters that could adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\nWe have significant operations, including centers of excellence, located in regions that have been, and may in the future be, exposed to hurricanes, earthquakes, water levels, wildfires, windstorms, and other natural disasters. We expect our facilities, operations, employees and communities in the future, particularly at facilities in coastal areas and areas prone to extreme weather events and water scarcity to continue to be at risk for future natural disasters or\n-19-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nother weather events (which may be exacerbated by climate change). Climate related changes can impact natural disasters, including weather patterns, with the increased frequency and severity of significant weather events (e.g., flooding, hurricanes and tropical storms), natural hazards (e.g., increased wildfire risk), rising mean temperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns (e.g., drought, desertification, and/or poor water quality). If a natural disaster occurs, our operations could be interrupted, our employees could be impacted, we could incur significant costs and our performance could be adversely affected. Our subcontractors and other suppliers have also been, and may in the future be, subject to natural disasters that could cause disruption and affect their ability to deliver or perform. Disruptions also impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs, or result in a lack of available coverage. Although we take steps to mitigate these risks, including considering them in determining where to put new businesses, the damage and disruption resulting from natural disasters, which may increase, as well as delays in recovery, may be significant.\nIf insurance or other sources are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nWe provide products and services, including related to hazardous and high risk operations, which subjects us to various environmental, regulatory, financial, reputational and other risks.\nWe provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations. Among other such operations, our products and services are used in nuclear-related activities (including nuclear-powered platforms) and used in support of nuclear-related operations of third parties. In addition, certain of our products are provided with space and missile launches. We use and provide energetic materials, including in propulsion systems, which include products that involve highly explosive or flammable elements. We develop missile systems, and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, as well as subsystems and components. These and other activities subject us to various extraordinary risks, including (1) potential liabilities relating to nuclear or non-nuclear launch-related incidents, unintended initiation of energetic materials and explosions, including risk of personal injury, property damage and environmental harm; (2) harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclear-related activities, operations or incidents; the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; and the development, testing and use of energetics, including in propulsion systems, and unintended explosions or releases and (3) to failed launches. We may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of such incidents or hazardous operations, whether or not the cause was within our control, and insurance may not be reasonably available. Under some circumstances, the U.S. government and prime contractors may provide for certain indemnification and other protection, including pursuant to, or in connection with, Public Law 85-804, 10 U.S.C. 3861, the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act, the NASA Space Act, the Commercial Space Launch Act and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act, for certain risks, but those protections may not be available or adequate.\nCertain of our products, such as medium and large caliber ammunition and propulsion systems, involve the use, manufacture and/or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials or other hazardous substances. These activities have resulted and may result in incidents that cause workplace injuries and fatalities, the temporary shut down or other disruption of manufacturing, production delays, environmental harm and expense, fines and liabilities to third parties. We have safety and loss prevention programs, which provide for pre-construction reviews, along with safety audits of operations involving explosive materials, to attempt to mitigate some such incidents, as well as potentially insurance coverage and indemnification, but they may not be successful.\nIn addition, our customers may use our products and services in ways that can be unusually hazardous or risky, or in ways that are not intended, which may create potential liabilities for our company, as well as reputational harm.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize (e.g. if there was a nuclear incident, or an incident related to launch activities or the use of energetics or propulsion systems), and if insurance coverage or indemnification or other protection was not fully available, it could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nWe may be unable fully to exploit or adequately to protect intellectual property rights, which could materially affect our ability to compete, our reputation and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nTo perform on our contracts and to win new business, we depend on our ability to develop, protect and exploit our intellectual property and also to access the intellectual property of others under reasonable terms. Increasing demands from our customers to access and obtain rights in our intellectual property, and positions taken by our suppliers and competitors challenge our ability to exploit, protect and access intellectual property.\n-20-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nWe own many forms of intellectual property, including U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets and we license or otherwise obtain access to various intellectual property rights of third parties. The U.S. government and certain foreign governments hold licenses or other rights to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts, and at times seek to use or authorize others to use such intellectual property, including in competition with us and including where we do not believe they are entitled to do so. Governments continue to increase efforts to assert or obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property, which could reduce our ability to develop, protect and exploit certain of our intellectual property rights and to compete. Governments also decline at times to make intellectual property of others available to us under acceptable terms.\nWe rely significantly upon proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how. We typically seek to protect this information, including by entering into intellectual property agreements with our employees and other parties such as consultants, teammates and subcontractors. These agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information. In the event of an infringement of such intellectual property rights, a breach of a confidentiality agreement, a misuse or theft of our intellectual property or divulgence of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies. In addition, our trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nIn some instances, our ability to win or perform contracts requires us to use third party intellectual property. This may require the government or our customer to provide rights to such third party intellectual property, or that we are able to negotiate directly with third parties to obtain necessary rights on reasonable terms. That may not be practicable.\nOur intellectual property is subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties. Our access to and use of intellectual property licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties is also subject to challenges. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management’s attention. Moreover, the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by foreign laws and courts may not be favorable.\nIf we are unable adequately to exploit our intellectual property rights, to protect our intellectual property rights, to obtain rights to intellectual property of others, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, ability to compete for and perform on contracts, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nGeneral and Other Risk Factors\n•\nOur insurance coverage, customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be unavailable or inadequate to cover all of our significant risks, which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position.\nWe endeavor to obtain insurance from financially solid, responsible, highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities (including, for example, natural disasters, space launches and on-orbit operations, cyber security, hazardous operations, energetics and products liability). Not every risk or liability can be insured, and insurance coverage is not always reasonably available. The policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable may not be sufficient to cover actual losses or liabilities. For example, the space and property insurance markets are experiencing increased price volatility and capacity constraint. Due to recent increases in the frequency and severity of losses, insurers are decreasing limits, increasing pricing and some may exit the market. Even if insurance coverage is available, we are not always able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us or without increasing exclusions. Disputes with insurance carriers over the availability of coverage, and the insolvency of one or more of our insurers has affected and may continue to affect the availability or timing of recovery, as well as our ability to obtain insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future. In some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions, laws or otherwise. However, these protections are not always available, are difficult to negotiate and obtain, are typically subject to certain terms or limitations, including the availability of funds, and may not be sufficient to cover our losses or liabilities. If insurance coverage, customer indemnifications and/or other legal protections are not available or are not sufficient to cover risks or losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nPension and other postretirement benefit (OPB) obligations and related expenses and funding requirements may fluctuate significantly depending upon investment performance of plan assets, changes in actuarial assumptions, and legislative or other regulatory actions.\n-21-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe company’s pension and OPB obligations and related expenses are dependent upon the investment performance of plan assets and various assumptions, including discount rates, mortality and the estimated long-term rates of return on plan assets. Changes in assumptions associated with our pension and OPB plans, investment performance of plan assets, and gains or losses associated with changes in valuation of marketable securities related to our non-qualified plans and other non-operating assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nFunding requirements for our pension plans, including Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions. In accordance with government regulations, pension plan cost recoveries under our U.S. government contracts may occur in different periods from when they are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made. These timing differences, as well as government challenges to pension and OPB cost recovery, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nBusiness investments and/or recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets may become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nGoodwill is an intangible asset that we recognize in connection with acquisitions of third-party businesses. Goodwill accounts for approximately 38 percent of our total assets as of December 31, 2023. Other long-lived assets principally comprise property, plant and equipment (PP&E) used in operating our business. The cost of PP&E utilized in support of our commercial business, including approximately $500 million of PP&E used in our commercial space business, is not allocable to government contracts and is therefore subject to greater recoverability risk than PP&E utilized in support of our U.S. government contracts. Although the fair value of our reporting units and the net realizable value of our other long-lived assets currently exceed their respective carrying values, changes in business conditions, the market-based inputs used in our goodwill impairment test, or our assumptions related to the recoverability of our long-lived assets, could result in significant write-offs of goodwill or other long-lived assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations."

    "text": "We recognize the critical importance of maintaining the safety and security of our systems and data and have a holistic process for overseeing and managing cybersecurity and related risks. This process is supported by both management and our Board of Directors.\nThe Chief Information Office, which maintains our cybersecurity function, is led by our Chief Information Officer (CIO), who reports to our CEO. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reports to the CIO and generally is responsible for management of cybersecurity risk and the protection and defense of our networks and systems. The CISO manages a team of cybersecurity professionals with broad experience and expertise, including in cybersecurity threat assessments and detection, mitigation technologies, cybersecurity training, incident response, cyber forensics, insider threats and regulatory compliance.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our enterprise risk management activities in general, and each of our Board committees assists the Board in the role of risk oversight. The full Board receives an update on the Company’s risk management process and the risk trends related to cybersecurity at least annually. The Audit and Risk Committee specifically assists the Board in its oversight of risks related to cybersecurity. To help ensure effective oversight, the Audit and Risk Committee receives reports on information security and cybersecurity from the CISO at least four times a year.\nIn addition, the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management Council (ERMC) considers risks relating to cybersecurity, among other significant risks, and applicable mitigation plans to address such risks. The ERMC is comprised of the Executive Leadership Team, as well as the Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Corporate Secretary, Chief Sustainability Officer, Treasurer and Vice President, Internal Audit. The CIO and CISO attend each ERMC meeting. The ERMC meets during the year and receives periodic updates on cybersecurity risks from the CIO and CISO. We have an established process and playbook led by our CISO governing our assessment, response and notifications internally and externally upon the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident. Depending on the nature and severity of an incident, this process provides for escalating notification to our CEO and the Board (including our Lead Independent Director and the Audit and Risk Committee chair).\n-22-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nOur approach to cybersecurity risk management includes the following key elements:\n•\nMulti-Layered Defense and Continuous Monitoring\n– We work to protect our computing environments and products from cybersecurity threats through multi-layered defenses and apply lessons learned from our defense and monitoring efforts to help prevent future attacks. We utilize data analytics to detect anomalies and search for cyber threats. Our Cybersecurity Operations Center provides comprehensive cyber threat detection and response capabilities and maintains a 24x7 monitoring system which complements the technology, processes and threat detection techniques we use to monitor, manage and mitigate cybersecurity threats. From time to time, we engage third party consultants or other advisors to assist in assessing, identifying and/or managing cybersecurity threats. We also periodically use our Internal Audit function to conduct additional reviews and assessments.\n•\nInsider Threats\n– We maintain an insider threat program designed to identify, assess, and address potential risks from within our Company. Our program evaluates potential risks consistent with industry practices, customer requirements and applicable law, including privacy and other considerations.\n•\nInformation Sharing and Collaboration\n– We work with government, customer, industry and/or supplier partners, such as the National Defense Information Sharing and Analysis Center and other government-industry partnerships, to gather and develop best practices and share information to address cyber threats. These relationships enable the rapid sharing of threat and vulnerability mitigation information across the defense industrial base and supply chain.\n•\nThird Party Risk Assessments\n– We conduct information security assessments before sharing or allowing the hosting of sensitive data in computing environments managed by third parties, and our standard terms and conditions contain contractual provisions requiring certain security protections.\n•\nTraining and Awareness\n– We provide awareness training to our employees to help identify, avoid and mitigate cybersecurity threats. Our employees with network access participate annually in required training, including spear phishing and other awareness training. We also periodically host tabletop exercises with management and other employees to practice rapid cyber incident response.\n•\nSupplier Engagement\n– We provide training and other resources to our suppliers to support cybersecurity resiliency in our supply chain. We also require our suppliers to comply with our standard information security terms and conditions, in addition to any requirements from our customers, as a condition of doing business with us, and require them to complete information security questionnaires to review and assess any potential cyber-related risks depending on the nature of the services being provided.\nWhile we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, to date none have materially affected the Company or our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. We continue to invest in the cybersecurity and resiliency of our networks and to enhance our internal controls and processes, which are designed to help protect our systems and infrastructure, and the information they contain. For more information regarding the risks we face from cybersecurity threats, please see “Risk Factors.”\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND PROJECTIONS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the information we are incorporating by reference contain statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “believe,” “estimate,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “trends,” “goals” and similar expressions generally identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements relating to our future financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions, expectations, plans and projections that we believe to be reasonable when made, but which may change over time. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and inherently involve a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Specific risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those identified under “Risk Factors” and other important factors disclosed in this report and from time to time in our other SEC filings.

    "text": "OVERVIEW\nThe following discussion should be read along with the financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as well as Part II, “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (“2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K”).\nGlobal Security Environment\nThe U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including in particular major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, increasing nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic circumstances and priorities. Our operations and financial performance, as well as demand for our products and services, are impacted by global events, including violence and unrest. The same is true for our suppliers and other business partners.\nThe conflict in Ukraine has increased global tensions and instability, highlighted threats and increased global demand, as well as further disrupted global supply chains. We continue to not anticipate significant adverse financial impacts directly from the ongoing conflict. We have experienced, and, while difficult to predict, may continue to experience a modest increase in demand for certain of our goods and services directly and indirectly related to the conflict in Ukraine, either through direct sales or if the U.S. provides increased military assistance and support to Ukraine.\nMore recently, the hostilities in Israel and the Gaza Strip have further heightened global tensions and instability.\nAt this time, it is unknown whether hostilities in this region will escalate into an even larger conflict. The demand for our goods and services may increase, especially if the U.S. provides increased military assistance and support to Israel. We do not have a significant business presence in the region, and therefore do not anticipate significant adverse financial impacts directly from the current conflict.\nMore broadly, the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and threats elsewhere, particularly in the Pacific region, have heightened tensions and highlighted security requirements globally, including Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific region, as well as the U.S. These conflicts may result in increased demand for defense products and services from allies and partner nations, particularly in those areas. We are actively exploring both opportunities and risks associated with the broader global security environment.\nWe believe the current global security environment highlights the significant national security threats to the U.S. and its allies, and the need for strong deterrence and a robust defense capability. We believe our capabilities, particularly in space, C4ISR, missile defense, battle management, advanced weapons, and survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers in the U.S. and globally defend against current and future threats and, as a result, continue to allow for long-term profitable business growth.\nGlobal Economic Enviro\nnment\nThe global economic environment has experienced extraordinary challenges, including high rates of inflation and inflationary pressures; widespread delays and disruptions in supply chains; business slowdowns or shutdowns; workforce challenges and labor shortfalls; and market volatility. Some of these challenges were due, in part, to the global health emergency caused by COVID-19, which the World Health organization declared ended in May 2023. Direct impacts of COVID-19 on our business during 2023 were limited, and we are not currently expecting significant direct impacts on our business going forward.\nThe macroeconomic factors have contributed, and we expect will continue to contribute, to increased costs, delays, disruptions and other performance challenges, as well as increased competing demands for limited resources to address such increased costs and other challenges, for our company, our suppliers and partners, and our customers.\nWe continue to work hard to mitigate challenges caused by the current macroeconomic environment on our business, including by taking steps to support our suppliers and small businesses and enhancing our workforce through extensive hiring, development and retention efforts. However, the broader macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, continued adversely to affect the company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2023. We cannot clearly predict how long these macroeconomic challenges will continue, how they will change over time, or what additional resources will be available, but we expect to see this challenging macroeconomic environment continue adversely to impact the global economy, our customers and suppliers, our industry and our company in 2024.\n-29-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nIn addition, increased interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing for governments, could further impact government spending priorities (in the U.S. and allied countries, in particular), including their demand for defense products. Economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements, could also further impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions.\nU.S. Political, Budget and Regulatory Environment\nThe U.S. continues to face an uncertain and evolving political, budget and regulatory environment. In particular, it is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets. Current and future requirements related to the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, threats in the Pacific regions and other security priorities, as well as global inflation, the national debt, and other domestic priorities, among other things, in the U.S. and globally, will continue to impact our customers’ budgets, spending and priorities, and our industry. The U.S. political environment, including the U.S. election cycle, may also impact defense budgets and priorities, issues related to the national debt, and government spending more broadly. We anticipate that issues related to budgetary priorities and defense spending levels, the debt ceiling, and the spending caps imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA), particularly with respect to discretionary spending, will continue to be a subject of considerable debate, with a potentially significant impact on our programs and the company.\nAnnual appropriations to fund the federal government for FY 2024 have not been enacted.\nCongress continues to pass short-term continuing resolutions (CR) to fund the federal government. The most recent “laddered” CR passed in January 2024 funds the government through March 2024, depending on the appropriation bill. If Congress does not pass full year appropriations or an additional CR before current funding expires, the federal government (or select departments) could face a shutdown and cease what are characterized as certain non-essential operations. Depending on the nature and duration of a potential shutdown, businesses that rely on government funding, including defense contractors, could be significantly impacted. If the federal government remains under a CR at the end of April 2024, the one percent discretionary spending cuts under the FRA could be triggered, potentially resulting in lower funding on the programs in which we participate.\nIn December 2023, the president signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2024 which supports approximately $886 billion in FY 2024 funding for national defense, $842 billion of which is for the DoD.\nThe political environment, federal budget, debt ceiling and regulatory environment are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, especially in light of the ongoing conflicts and heightened global tensions, the inflationary environment and political tensions. The results of those debates could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular. We anticipate that the broader macroeconomic environment, with ongoing inflationary pressures, pockets of labor challenges, and supply chain disruption, among other considerations, will continue to play a significant role in the outcome of these debates and, in turn, on our industry and company.\nFor further information on the global security and economic environment and U.S. political, budget and regulatory environment, including the risks related thereto, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks” and “Risks Factors” included in this Form 10-K.\nGround-Based Strategic Deterrent (“GBSD” or “Sentinel”) Program Nunn-McCurdy Breach Review\nDue in part to the impact of macroeconomic factors, in January 2024 the customer provided congressional notification that the Sentinel program is currently under a Nunn-McCurdy breach review, which is required when total program cost estimates exceed certain defined thresholds. This notification, which has been driven primarily by increases in construction and procurement cost projections for the Production and Deployment phases, commences the process to achieve recertification for continuance of the program and update its baseline cost estimates. We are currently executing under a cost-type contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase, and the Production and Deployment phases are yet to be priced and negotiated. We are continuing to partner with our customer to address this critical mission. For more information, see “Risk Factors”.\nDisposition of IT and Mission Support Services Business\nEffective January 30, 2021 (the “Divestiture date”), we completed the sale of our IT and mission support services business (the “IT services divestiture”) for $3.4 billion in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion. The IT and mission support services business was comprised of the majority of the former Information Solutions and Services (IS&S) division of Defense Systems (excluding the Vinnell Arabia business); select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, which were part of the former Cyber and Intelligence Mission Solutions (CIMS) division of Mission Systems; and the former Space Technical Services business unit of Space Systems. Operating results include sales and operating income for the IT and mission support services business prior to the Divestiture\n-30-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ndate; therefore, no sales and operating income were recognized for this business during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The company recorded sales of $162 million and pre-tax profit of $20 million for the IT and mission support services business during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOperating Performance Assessment and Reporting\nWe manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs (typically larger contracts or two or more closely-related contracts). We recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts as control is transferred to the customer, primarily over time on a cost-to-cost basis (cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion). As a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts. Due to the applicable FAR and CAS requirements that govern our U.S. government business, most types of costs are allocable to U.S. government contracts. As such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (G&A) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.\nIn evaluating our operating performance, we primarily focus on changes in sales and operating margin rates. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in operating margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume-related changes in profitability, which are typically described in terms of changes in net EAC adjustments. Contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS\nFor purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” or “FAS”).\nMark-to-market adjusted net earnings (MTM-adjusted net earnings) and MTM-adjusted earnings per share (MTM-adjusted EPS) exclude MTM pension and OPB (expense)/benefit and related tax impacts, which are generally only recognized during the fourth quarter. Transaction-adjusted net earnings and transaction-adjusted earnings per share (transaction-adjusted EPS) exclude the MTM impacts noted above, as well as impacts related to the IT services divestiture, including the gain on sale of the business, associated federal and state income tax expenses, transaction costs, and the make-whole premium for early debt redemption. These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses, and with regard to transaction-adjusted net earnings and EPS, the impact of certain divestiture activity. These measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of MTM accounting and the IT services divestiture are not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards.\nWe reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. These non-GAAP measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.\n-31-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nSelected financial highlights are presented in the table below:\nSales\n2023 sales increased $2.7 billion, or 7 percent,\ndue to higher sales at all four sectors. 2023 sales reflect continued strong demand for our products and services.\nSee “Segment Operating Results” below for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments.\nOperating Income and Margin Rate\n2023 operating income decreased $1.1 billion, or 30 percent, primarily due to a $1.56 billion charge on the B-21 program at Aeronautics Systems, partially offset by higher operating income at Space Systems and Defense Systems. The B-21 charge relates to the low-rate initial production (LRIP) phase of the program and is due principally to a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The decrease was also offset by $311 million of lower unallocated corporate expense, largely due to higher deferred state tax benefits associated with the MTM adjustment and B-21 charge and lower intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation, as well as a $118 million reduction in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. 2023 operating margin rate declined to 6.5 percent from 9.8 percent reflecting the items above.\n2023 G&A costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.2 percent from 10.6 percent, primarily due to higher sales, which more than offset our continued investments for future business opportunities.\nFor further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses, see “Product and Service Analysis” below.\nMark-to-Market Pension and OPB Benefit/Expense\nThe primary components of pre-tax MTM (expense) benefit are presented in the table below:\n-32-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe 2023 MTM expense of $422 million was primarily driven by a 39 basis point decrease in the discount rate from year end 2022, partially offset by actual net plan asset returns of 11.1 percent compared to our 7.5 percent asset return assumption.\nFederal and Foreign Income Taxes\nThe 2023 effective tax rate (ETR) decreased to 12.4 percent from 16.1 percent in 2022 primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes as a result of the B-21 charge and MTM expense, which collectively reduced the 2023 ETR by 3.8 percentage points. The 2022 MTM benefit increased the 2022 ETR by 1.2 percentage points. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nNet Earnings\nThe table below reconciles net earnings to MTM-adjusted net earnings and transaction-adjusted net earnings:\n(1)\nThe deferred state tax impact in each period was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 5.25 percent and is included in Unallocated corporate expense within operating income.\n(2)\nThe federal tax impact in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax impact from MTM benefit (expense) and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate.\n(3)\nThe state tax impact includes $62 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.\n(4)\nThe federal tax impact was calculated by applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate to the adjustment items and also includes $250 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.\n2023 net earnings decreased $2.8 billion, or 58 percent, principally due to a $1.7 billion decrease in our MTM (expense) benefit, a $975 million reduction in the non-operating FAS pension benefit and the $1.1 billion decrease in operating income described above, partially offset by a $650 million decrease in income tax expense, a $107 million increase in returns on marketable securities related to our non-qualified benefit plans, and a $97 million gain recognized upon the sale of our minority investment in an Australian business.\n-33-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\nThe table below reconciles diluted earnings per share to MTM-adjusted EPS and transaction-adjusted EPS:\n(1)\nThe deferred state tax impact in each period was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 5.25 percent and is included in Unallocated corporate expense within operating income.\n(2)\nThe federal tax impact in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax impact from MTM benefit (expense) and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate.\n(3)\nThe state tax impact includes $62 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.\n(4)\nThe federal tax impact was calculated by applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate to the adjustment items and also includes $250 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.\n2023 diluted earnings per share decreased $17.94, or 57 percent, reflecting the 58 percent decrease in net earnings described above and a 2 percent decrease in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nSEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\nBasis of Presentation\nThe company is aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems. For a more complete description of each segment’s products and services, see “Business.”\nSegment Operating Income and Margin Rate\nSegment operating income, as reconciled in the table below, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) are non-GAAP measures that reflect the combined operating income of our four segments less the operating income associated with intersegment sales. Segment operating income includes pension expense allocated to our sectors under FAR and CAS and excludes FAS pension service expense and unallocated corporate items (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable FAR and CAS requirements, and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance). These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures may not be\n-34-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ndefined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.\n(1)\nRepresents the deferred state tax (benefits) expenses associated with MTM (expense) benefit and the B-21 charge, which are recorded in Unallocated corporate expense (income) consistent with other changes in deferred state taxes.\nSegment Operating Income and Margin Rate\n2023 segment operating income decreased $1.5 billion, or 35 percent, and segment operating margin rate decreased to 7.0 percent primarily due to the B-21 charge at Aeronautics Systems. Operating income at Space Systems and Defense Systems was higher than in the prior year period.\nFAS/CAS Operating Adjustment\nThe decrease in our 2023 FAS/CAS operating adjustment is primarily due to lower FAS pension service expense resulting from changes in certain actuarial assumptions as of December 31, 2022.\nUnallocated Corporate Expense (Income)\nThe decrease in 2023 unallocated corporate expense is primarily due to higher deferred state tax benefits associated with the MTM adjustment and B-21 charge and lower intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation.\nNet Estimate-At-Completion (EAC) Adjustments -\nWe record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion (net EAC adjustments) using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. Net EAC adjustments can have a significant effect on reported sales and operating income and the aggregate amounts are presented in the table below:\n-35-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nNet EAC adjustments by segment are presented in the table below:\nAERONAUTICS SYSTEMS\nAeronautics Systems is a leader in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of military aircraft systems for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, other U.S. government agencies, and international customers. Major products include strategic long-range strike aircraft; tactical fighter and air dominance aircraft; airborne battle management and command and control systems; and unmanned autonomous aircraft systems, including high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) strategic intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) tactical ISR systems.\nSales\n2023 sales increased $255 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to higher volume on restricted programs, partially offset by a $191 million decrease on the F/A-18 program largely due to post Multi-Year Procurement 4 (MYP4) contract award timing, a $131 million decrease on the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) program as that program nears completion and a decrease on the E-2 program largely related to higher material volume in the prior year.\nOperating Income\n2023 operating income decreased $1.6 billion and operating margin rate decreased to (4.4) percent primarily due to the previously described $1.56 billion charge recorded on the LRIP phase of the B-21 program, inclusive of a $143 million unfavorable EAC adjustment for the first LRIP lot. The prior year period includes $133 million of favorable EAC adjustments on the engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the B-21 program and a $38 million gain on a property sale. Apart from the B-21 EAC adjustments noted above, net EAC adjustments across the sector were $58 million higher than in the prior year.\nDEFENSE SYSTEMS\nDefense Systems is a leader in the design, development, integration and production of advanced tactical weapons and missile defense solutions, and a provider of sustainment, modernization and training services for manned and unmanned aircraft and electronics systems for the U.S. military and a broad range of international customers. Major products and services include integrated, all-domain command and control (C2) battle management systems, precision strike weapons; advanced propulsion, including high speed air-breathing and hypersonic systems; high-performance gun systems, ammunition, precision munitions and advanced fuzes; aircraft and mission systems logistics support, sustainment, operations and modernization; and warfighter training.\n-36-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nSales\n2023 sales increased $283 million, or 5 percent, primarily due to higher volume on several programs, including ammunition programs, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), an international training program, Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM), and Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW).\nOperating Income\n2023 operating income increased $46 million, or 7 percent, due to higher sales and a higher operating margin rate. Operating margin rate increased to 12.1 percent from 11.9 percent primarily due to the write-down of an unconsolidated joint venture investment in the prior year.\nMISSION SYSTEMS\nMission Systems is a leader in advanced mission solutions and multifunction systems, primarily for the U.S. defense and intelligence community, and international customers. Major products and services include command, control, communications and computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; radar, electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic sensors; electronic warfare systems; advanced communications and network systems; full spectrum cyber solutions; intelligence processing systems; advanced microelectronics; navigation and positioning sensors; and maritime power, propulsion and payload launch systems.\nSales\n2023 sales increased $499 million, or 5 percent, primarily due to higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs, as well as a $165 million increase on marine systems programs. These increases were partially offset by a $107 million decrease on the Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) program largely driven by the timing of material receipts and full-rate production (FRP) 5 contract award, as well as lower volume on airborne radar programs.\nOperating Income\n2023 operating income decreased $9 million, or 1 percent, due to a lower operating margin rate, which more than offset higher sales. Operating margin rate decreased to 14.8 percent from 15.6 percent primarily due to a prior year $33 million benefit recognized in connection with a contract-related legal matter, as well as changes in contract mix toward more cost-type content.\nSPACE SYSTEMS\nSpace Systems is a leader in delivering end-to-end mission solutions through the design, development, integration, production and operation of space, missile defense, launch and strategic missile systems for national security, civil government, commercial and international customers. Major products include satellites and spacecraft systems, subsystems, sensors and payloads; ground systems; missile defense systems and interceptors; launch vehicles and related propulsion systems; and strategic missiles.\nSales\n2023 sales increased $1.7 billion, or 14 percent, primarily due to higher volume on restricted programs and ramp-up on development programs, including increases of $426 million on the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program, $333 million on the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Polar (NextGen Polar) program, $219 million on the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program, $119 million on the Space Development Agency (SDA) Tranche 1 Tracking Layer program and $102 million on the SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer program. These increases were partially offset by a $172 million decrease for Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) missions and a $109 million decrease on the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) program.\n-37-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nOperating Income\n2023 operating income increased $54 million, or 5 percent, due to higher sales, partially offset by a lower operating margin rate. Operating margin rate decreased to 8.7 percent from 9.4 percent primarily due to a prior year $96 million gain recognized in connection with a land exchange transaction, as well as lower net EAC adjustments driven by $100 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments on the HALO program in 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a $42 million benefit from insurance recoveries in our commercial space business during 2023.\nPRODUCT AND SERVICE ANALYSIS\nThe following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment:\nProduct Sales and Costs\n2023 product sales increased $2.4 billion, or 8 percent, due to an increase in product sales at all four sectors. The increase was principally driven by higher volume on restricted programs, GBSD and NGI at Space Systems, higher restricted sales at Mission Systems and Aeronautics Systems, and higher volume on ammunition programs, GMLRS, IBCS and HACM at Defense Systems.\n2023 product costs increased $4.0 billion, or 16 percent, consistent with the higher product sales described above and reflect a lower operating margin rate principally due to the previously described $1.56 billion charge on the B-21 program at Aeronautics Systems and lower net EAC adjustments on Space Systems production programs.\nService Sales and Costs\n2023 service sales increased $313 million, or 4 percent, due to an increase in service sales at all four sectors. The increase was principally driven by higher restricted sales at Space Systems and Aeronautics Systems, higher volume on restricted programs and F-35 sustainment at Mission Systems, and higher volume on an international training program at Defense Systems.\n-38-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n2023 service costs increased $180 million, or 3 percent, consistent with the higher service sales described above and reflects a higher operating margin rate on Space Systems service programs.\nBACKLOG\nBacklog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. It comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded. Backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.\nBacklog consisted of the following at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 net awards totaled $44.8 billion. Significant 2023 new awards include $15.5 billion for restricted programs (primarily at Space Systems, Aeronautics Systems and Mission Systems), $2.1 billion for F-35 programs (primarily at Aeronautics Systems and Mission Systems), $1.7 billion for E-2, $1.5 billion for Triton, $1.4 billion for SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer, and $0.8 billion for GMLRS.\nSubsequent Event\n– In January 2024, the company received a termination for convenience in our restricted Space business. The company expects to reduce backlog by approximately $2 billion during the first quarter of 2024 related to the termination.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe are focused on the efficient conversion of operating income into cash to provide for the company’s material cash requirements, including working capital needs, satisfaction of contractual commitments, funding of our pension and OPB plans, investment in our business through capital expenditures, and shareholder return through dividend payments and share repurchases.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion; $277 million was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. We expect cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities, commercial paper and/or in the capital markets through our shelf registration with the SEC, if needed, to be sufficient to provide liquidity to the company in the short-term and long-term. The company has a five-year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, and in April 2023, we renewed our one-year $500 million uncommitted credit facility. At December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. In February 2023, we issued $2.0 billion of unsecured senior notes for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment, share repurchases and working capital.\nThe company’s principal contractual commitments include purchase obligations, repayments of long-term debt and related interest, and payments under operating leases. At December 31, 2023, we had $20.7 billion of purchase obligations, approximately half of which is short-term. Purchase obligations are largely comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors under U.S. government contracts. In most circumstances, our risk associated with the purchase obligations on our U.S. government contracts is limited to the termination liability provisions within those contracts. As such, we do not believe they represent a material liquidity risk to the company. At December 31, 2023, we had capital expenditure commitments of $1.4 billion, which we expect to satisfy with cash on hand. We also had provisions for uncertain tax positions of $2.0 billion, some or all of which could result in future cash payments to various taxing authorities. At this time, we are unable to estimate the timing and amount of any future cash outflows related to these uncertain tax positions.\nRefer to the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase programs (Note 3), commercial paper, credit facilities and long-term debt (Note 10), standby letters of\n-39-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ncredit and guarantees (Note 12), future minimum contributions for the company’s pension and OPB plans (Note 13), and lease payment obligations (Note 15).\nInternal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 174\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current year and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to IRC Section 174. Our 2022 cash from operations were reduced by approximately $900 million for federal estimated tax payments we made related to Section 174. As we finalized our 2022 federal tax return along with our continued analysis of research and development expenditures, we reduced the previously estimated impact of Section 174 on our tax liability for 2022 and 2023 to approximately $700 million and $500 million, respectively. Congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, possibly with retroactive effect. In the meantime, we expect to continue to make additional federal tax payments based on the current Section 174 tax law. The impact of Section 174 on our cash from operations depends on the amount of research and development expenditures incurred by the company and whether the IRS issues guidance on the provision which differs from our current interpretation, among other things.\nCash Flow Measures\nIn addition to our cash position, we consider various cash flow measures in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure described in more detail below.\nOperating Cash Flow\nThe table below summarizes key components of cash provided by operating activities:\n(1)\nIncludes depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, MTM (expense) benefit, stock based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and net periodic pension and OPB income.\n2023 cash provided by operating activities increased $974 million, or 34 percent, principally due to improved trade working capital largely driven by increased billings and cash collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted free cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer (not otherwise included in net cash provided by or used in operating activities) and the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions, if any. Adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction. It also includes the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance. This measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.\n-40-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow:\n2023 adjusted free cash flow increased $479 million, or 30 percent, principally due to higher net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.\nInvesting Cash Flow\n2023 net cash used in investing activities increased $341 million principally due to higher capital expenditures. Proceeds from the sale of minority investments in 2023 were largely offset by cash received in 2022 from the sale of equipment to a customer.\nFinancing Cash Flow\n2023 net cash used in financing activities decreased $852 million principally due to the issuance of $2.0 billion in long-term debt, partially offset by $1.05 billion in debt repayments. Cash returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends totaled $2.6 billion in each period.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nDue to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services.\nContract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), un-priced change orders, REAs and contract claims. Variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.\nOur cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost. Since our contracts often span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost, and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. Factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.\nWe also consider the impact of macroeconomic factors on our estimates, in particular on contract EACs that span several years. For example, during 2023, we included in our EACs management’s best estimate of the impact inflation has had and may continue to have on our contracts. We also included our current best estimate of the impact on our EACs of disruptions we have experienced and continue to experience in the supply chain. The volatility of the recent macroeconomic environment has added complexity to our estimation process and may result in our year end 2023 contract EACs having more variability in the future than they might otherwise have had if the estimates had been prepared in a more stable macroeconomic environment.\n-41-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nWe generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. These assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by any number of these factors over time, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those estimates as facts and circumstances change or become known to us.\nThe company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. Cost estimates on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than on mature, full-rate production contracts. As a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates and greater financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts. Changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and G&A costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. Identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. Similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.\nFor the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, see “Segment Operating Results” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRetirement Benefits\nOverview\n– The determination of projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and pension and OPB expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. When we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and OPB expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease materially. The principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and OPB plans. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions (i.e., actuarial gains or losses) are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.\nDiscount Rate\n– The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and OPB obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated AA or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 5.15 percent at December 31, 2023 and 5.54 percent at December 31, 2022.\nThe effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2023 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2023 pension and OPB obligations, which would be reflected in the 2023 MTM expense (benefit), and 2024 expected pension and OPB expense:\n-42-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCash Balance Crediting Rate\n– A portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. Interest is credited monthly using the current 30-Year Treasury bond rate. The interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment returns. The cash balance crediting rate used for FAS purposes tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related MTM expense (benefit). The minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 2.25 percent. The cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to 4.02 percent for all years. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2023 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2023 pension benefit obligation, which would be reflected in the 2023 MTM expense (benefit), and 2024 expected pension expense:\nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets –\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (EROA) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. EROA is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. Due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation, historical plan asset returns and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes. In addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. The EROA assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for OPB plans; however, we reduce the EROA for OPB plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts are taxable.\nDuring 2023, the Investment Committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed the plans’ major asset class allocations and approved an update to increase the target fixed-income asset allocation from 40% to 43%. The current asset allocation is now approximately 42% fixed-income, 27% public equities, 28% alternatives and 3% cash. At this time, the Investment Committee is not planning any significant changes to that mix. For further information on plan asset investments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWhile historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our EROA. Our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2023 was approximately 10.7 percent and our 20-year and 30-year rolling average rates of return were approximately 7.9 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively, each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses. Our 2023 return on plan assets, net of expenses, were approximately 11.1 percent.\nConsistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. We considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our EROA.\nFor determining 2023 FAS expense, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and an expected long-term rate of return on OPB plan assets of 7.23 percent. For 2024 FAS expense, we have assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and 7.12 percent on OPB plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our December 31, 2023 EROA assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2024 expected pension and OPB expense:\n-43-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nIn addition, holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2024 MTM expense (benefit):\nEstimated Fair Market Value of Plan Assets\n– For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available. Estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values (NAV), as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.\nMortality Rate\n– Mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee (RPEC) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. In October 2019, the RPEC issued an updated mortality base table (the Private Retirement Plans Mortality table for 2012 (Pri-2012)), which we adopted after reviewing our own historical mortality experience. In October 2021, the RPEC released a new projection scale (MP-2021) that included additional underlying data for 2019, which included an increase in life expectancies relative to the prior year.\nThe RPEC did not release a MP-2022 or MP-2023 projection scale citing complexities in incorporating the substantial number of “excess deaths” in 2020 into their existing model and uncertainties about future expectations primarily related to COVID-19. As such, after considering the information released by the RPEC in October 2021 as well as the company’s recent mortality experience, we adopted the full MP-2021 projection scale while continuing to use the Pri-2012 White Collar table, supplemented with 50% of the Gradual Wear-Off illustration as outlined in the RPEC’s 2022 Mortality Improvement Update paper to reflect the future impacts of COVID-19, to develop our mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and OPB obligations recognized at December 31, 2023, and the amounts estimated for our 2024 pension and OPB expense.\nFor further information regarding our pension and OPB plans, see “Risk Factors” and Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.\nLitigation, Commitments and Contingencies\nWe are subject to a range of claims, disputes, enforcement actions, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. We determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. Determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.\nEnvironmental Matters\n– We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. Factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology. As we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts, such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and other non-current assets until charged to contracts. We use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs, assessing, among other things, U.S. government regulations, our U.S. government contract mix and past practices. Portions of the company’s environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed. As of December 31, 2023, we expect approximately 90 percent of the company’s environmental remediation costs to be recoverable; however, to the extent our judgments on the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs change or the unallowable portion of our environmental\n-44-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nremediation costs otherwise increase, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIncome Tax Matters\n– The evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, requires the use of judgment. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. The company follows a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. We exercise judgment in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support our assessment using all available information. The technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position. In measuring the tax position, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. When it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. As of December 31, 2023, we have approximately $2.0 billion in unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\nFor further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1, Note 7, Note 11 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nOverview\n– We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.\nWe record property, plant and equipment (PP&E) for capital assets used in operating our business. The cost of PP&E utilized in support of our government contracts is generally allowable and allocable cost in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements, which limits our risk of impairment on those assets. However, the cost of PP&E utilized in support of our commercial business, including approximately $500 million of PP&E used in our commercial space business, is not allocable to government contracts and is therefore subject to greater recoverability risk.\nImpairment Testing\n– We test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. The results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nIn addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. During 2023, we determined there were no impairment indicators requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows we expect the reporting units to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. This income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. We use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.\nWe test for impairment of our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future\n-45-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\noperating cash flows of the related asset group. If such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nImpairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in developing the estimates used in our impairment analyses, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of those impairment analyses.\n-46-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION"

    "text": "EQUITY RISK\nWe have been and continue to be exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of $339 million at December 31, 2023. These securities are exposed to market volatilities, changes in price and interest rates.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on variable-rate short-term credit facilities for which there were no borrowings\noutstanding\nat December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023, we have $13.9 billion of long-term debt, primarily consisting of fixed-rate debt, with a fair value of approximately $13.4 billion. The terms of our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed-rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity. Additionally, if we were to refinance our long-term debt, it may be refinanced at higher interest rates.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nIn certain circumstances, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2023, foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $286 million were outstanding. At December 31, 2023, a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\nINFLATION RISK\nThe global macroeconomic environment has experienced extraordinary challenges, including the highest rates of inflation in 40 years. The company, its subcontractors and other suppliers, have experienced, and continue to experience, increased pressures from heightened levels of inflation and the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment, which we have not been able to fully mitigate on a number of our fixed-price contracts, in particular on the LRIP phase of the B-21 program at Aeronautics Systems. We cannot predict how long these inflationary pressures will continue, or how they may change over time, but we expect to see continued impacts on the global economy, our customers, our industry and our company. If inflationary pressures continue to persist, they may continue to have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flow.\n-47-"

    "text": "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation\nFalls Church, Virginia\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated January 24, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and risk committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition - Cost and Revenue Estimates for Development Contracts - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes substantially all revenue as control is transferred to the customer on their long-term contracts over time using the cost-to-cost method (cost incurred relative to total cost estimated at completion). Use of the cost-to-cost-method requires the Company to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and costs associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of their products or services. The Company estimates profit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated sales and total estimated costs at completion and recognizes that profit as costs are incurred. Cost\n-48-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nestimates on contracts requiring development work are inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts, and, as a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates. Certain of these contracts are fixed price in nature, which results in greater financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth. Alternatively, cost-type contracts may have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract. As a result, the estimation of costs required to complete these contracts and the expected revenues that will be earned is complex and requires significant judgment.\nGiven the judgment necessary to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and costs associated with such contracts, auditing these estimates required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of the underlying programs and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur auditing procedures related to the cost and revenue estimates for these development contracts included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the estimates of total costs and revenues on such contracts, including development costs and any related award or incentive fee estimates for the relevant performance obligations.\n•\nWe selected certain long-term contracts for testing and performed the following procedures:\n–\nEvaluated whether the recognition of revenue over time on such contracts was appropriate based on the terms and conditions of each contract, including whether continuous transfer of control to the customer occurred as progress was made toward fulfilling the performance obligation.\n–\nTested management’s identification of distinct performance obligations by evaluating whether the underlying goods and services were highly interdependent and interrelated.\n–\nTested management’s determination of the transaction price, including any award or incentive fees, based on the consideration expected to be received in accordance with the rights and obligations established under the contracts and any contractual modifications.\n–\nEvaluated the estimates of total cost and revenue for the performance obligation by:\n▪\nConducting inquiries of relevant program teams regarding any challenges related to the program.\n▪\nComparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated to be incurred to date.\n▪\nEvaluating management’s ability to achieve the estimates of cost and revenue by performing corroborating inquiries with the Company’s program and business management, and testing management’s process used to develop the estimates based on their work plans, engineering specifications, program labor, and supplier contracts. This includes management’s process to identify macroeconomic impacts to certain programs, which could include forecasted cost impacts and assumptions on the ability to recover those costs.\n▪\nEvaluating selected changes to the estimates of costs and obtaining supporting documentation on timing and amounts of these changes in estimates.\n–\nTested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculation of revenue recognized during the period for the performance obligations.\nIncome Taxes - Uncertain Tax Positions - Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. Uncertain tax positions reflect the Company’s expected treatment of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, which have not been reflected in measuring income tax expense or taxes payable for financial reporting purposes. Until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities or the statute of limitations concerning such issues lapses, the Company does not generally recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and reports the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in its consolidated statements of financial position. The Company has recognized increased uncertain tax positions in recent years\n-49-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nprincipally related to state apportionment, the methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs, and the 2017 Tax Act. Until the matters are resolved, the outcome is inherently uncertain.\nAuditing certain assumptions associated with the Company’s uncertain tax positions involved especially challenging judgments given the complexity and inherent subjectivity involved in evaluating the potential outcomes of these matters.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to certain assumptions used in determining uncertain tax positions included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and completeness of, and recognition for, uncertain tax positions, including management’s controls over the underlying key assumptions and inputs used to derive the estimates.\n•\nWith the assistance of our income tax specialists, we selected specific uncertain tax positions for testing and performed the following procedures:\n–\nInquired of the Company’s tax department, financial reporting department, and other personnel directly involved in the development of the estimates.\n–\nObtained supporting documentation and evaluated how the Company supported the position, including the assumptions and estimates used for measurement, and how the taxing authorities have historically challenged the tax position, if applicable.\n–\nEvaluated whether the uncertain tax position met the “more likely than not” recognition threshold.\n–\nEvaluated the appropriateness and consistency of the methodologies and assumptions used by management when developing these estimates.\n•\nWe tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations.\n-50-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n-51-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n-52-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n-53-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n-54-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation is a leading global aerospace and defense technology company. We deliver a broad range of products, services and solutions to U.S. and international customers, and principally to the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community. Our broad portfolio is aligned to support national security priorities and our solutions equip our customers with capabilities they need to connect, protect and advance humanity.\nThe company is a leading provider of space systems, military aircraft, missile defense, advanced weapons and long-range fires capabilities, mission systems, networking and communications, strategic deterrence systems, and breakthrough technologies, such as advanced computing, microelectronics and cyber. We are focused on competing and winning programs that enable continued growth, performing on our commitments and affordably delivering capability our customers need. With the investments we've made in advanced technologies, combined with our talented workforce and digital transformation capabilities, Northrop Grumman is well positioned to meet our customers' needs today and in the future.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Northrop Grumman and its subsidiaries and joint ventures or other investments for which we consolidate the financial results. Intercompany accounts, transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in equity securities and joint ventures where the company has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method.\nBasis of Presentation\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, we changed the presentation of the components of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to current period presentation. This change in presentation had no impact on our previously reported comprehensive income in total.\nAccounting Estimates\nThe company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation thereof requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates have been prepared using the most current and best available information; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our sales are derived from long-term contracts with the U.S. government for the development or production of goods, the provision of services, or a combination of both. The company classifies sales as product or service based on the predominant attributes of each performance obligation.\nThe company recognizes revenue for each separately identifiable performance obligation in a contract representing a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. In most cases, goods and services provided under the company’s contracts are accounted for as single performance obligations due to the complex and integrated nature of our products and services. These contracts generally require significant integration of a group of goods and/or services to deliver a combined output. In some contracts, the company provides multiple distinct goods or services to a customer, most commonly when a contract covers multiple phases of the product life cycle (e.g., development, production, sustainment, etc.). In those cases, the company accounts for the distinct contract deliverables as separate performance obligations and allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is generally estimated using cost plus a reasonable margin. Warranties are provided on certain contracts, but do not typically provide for services beyond standard assurances and are therefore not considered to be separate performance obligations. Assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are not material.\nThe company recognizes revenue as control is transferred to the customer, either over time or at a point in time. In general, our U.S. government contracts contain termination for convenience and/or other clauses that generally provide the customer rights to goods produced and/or in-process. Similarly, our non-U.S. government contracts generally contain contractual termination clauses or entitle the company to payment for work performed to date for goods and services that do not have an alternative use. For most of our contracts, control is effectively transferred during the period of performance, so we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method (cost incurred relative to total cost estimated at completion). The company believes this represents the most appropriate\n-55-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nmeasurement towards satisfaction of its performance obligations. Revenue for contracts in which the control of goods produced does not transfer until delivery to the customer is recognized at a point in time (i.e., typically upon delivery).\nContracts are often modified for changes in contract specifications or requirements, which may result in scope and/or price changes. Most of the company’s contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct in the context of the contract and are therefore accounted for as part of the original performance obligation through a cumulative EAC adjustment.\nContract Estimates\nUse of the cost-to-cost method requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. The company estimates profit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated sales and total estimated cost at completion and recognizes that profit as costs are incurred. Significant judgment is used to estimate total sales and cost at completion.\nContract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), un-priced change orders, REAs and contract claims. Variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.\nAt the request of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Space Systems submitted an engineering change proposal (ECP) during the fourth quarter of 2023 for scope increases and other aspects of the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) contract largely stemming from evolving Lunar Gateway architecture and mission requirements. The ECP addresses both work performed and work expected to be performed by the company resulting from scope changes previously approved by NASA, as well as changes NASA has requested the company to propose but has not yet directed the company to perform. The company has begun negotiating with NASA on these various changes and other aspects of the HALO contract. The company’s 2023 results include $\n100\nmillion of unfavorable EAC adjustments on the HALO contract and reflect our current best estimate of the outcome of the ECP negotiations assuming the terms of the current contract; however, if the outcome is less favorable than what we have assumed, it could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe recognize changes in estimated contract sales or costs and the resulting changes in contract profit on a cumulative basis. Cumulative EAC adjustments represent the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods; sales and operating margins in future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since contract inception. If it is determined that a loss is expected to result on an individual performance obligation, the entire amount of the estimable future loss, including an allocation of G&A costs, is charged against income in the period the loss is identified.\nB-21 Low-Rate Initial Production Options\nIn 2015, the U.S. Air Force awarded Northrop Grumman the B-21 contract, which includes a base contract for engineering, manufacturing, and design (EMD) and five low-rate initial production (LRIP) options in varying quantities. The EMD phase of the program is largely cost type and began at contract award. The LRIP options are largely fixed price and are expected to be awarded and executed through approximately the end of the decade. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the B-21 program entered flight testing and the company received an award for the first LRIP lot.\nWe previously disclosed it was reasonably possible one or more of the LRIP options could be performed at a loss principally due to the company’s estimate of the impact macroeconomic factors may have on our cost to complete the LRIP options, as well as ongoing discussions with our suppliers and our customer. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program, and we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The loss is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft.\nThe projected loss across the five LRIP lots, which we recognized during the fourth quarter of 2023, is $\n1.56\nbillion. The loss comprises a $\n143\nmillion unfavorable EAC adjustment for the first LRIP lot and a $\n1.37\nbillion loss contingency accrual and $\n45\nmillion reduction of inventoried costs for the unexercised LRIP lots. As of December 31, 2023, $\n631\nmillion of the loss contingency accrual is included in Other current liabilities and $\n740\nmillion is included in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n-56-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nIf our estimated cost to complete the LRIP phase of the program changes or our assumptions regarding contract performance, quantities, or funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions are resolved more or less favorably than what we have estimated, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially affected.\nNet EAC Adjustments\nThe following table presents the effect of aggregate net EAC adjustments:\n(1)\nBased on a 21% federal statutory tax rate.\nEAC adjustments on a single performance obligation can have a significant effect on the company’s financial statements. When such adjustments occur, we generally disclose the nature, underlying conditions and financial impact of the adjustments. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded a $\n143\nmillion unfavorable EAC adjustment on the first LRIP lot of the B-21 program at Aeronautics Systems as described above. During 2023, we recorded $\n100\nmillion of unfavorable EAC adjustments on the HALO program at Space Systems largely due to cost growth stemming from evolving Lunar Gateway architecture and mission requirements combined with macroeconomic challenges. During 2022, we recorded $\n133\nmillion of favorable EAC adjustments on the EMD phase of the B-21 program at Aeronautics Systems. During 2021, we recorded $\n135\nmillion of unfavorable EAC adjustments on the F-35 program at Aeronautics Systems. No other such adjustments were significant to the financial statements during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. It comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and IDIQ contracts are not included in backlog until the time an option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded.\nCompany backlog as of December 31, 2023 was $\n84.2\nbillion.\nOf our December 31, 2023 backlog, we expect to recognize approximately\n40\npercent as revenue over the next\n12\nmonths and\n65\npercent as revenue over the next\n24\nmonths, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter.\nSubsequent Event\n– In January 2024, the company received a termination for convenience in our restricted Space business. The company expects to reduce backlog by approximately $\n2\nbillion during the first quarter of 2024 related to the termination.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nFor each of the company’s contracts, the timing of revenue recognition, customer billings, and cash collections results in a net contract asset or liability at the end of each reporting period. Fixed-price contracts are typically billed to the customer either using progress payments, whereby amounts are billed monthly as costs are incurred or work is completed, or performance based payments, which are based upon the achievement of specific, measurable events or accomplishments defined and valued at contract inception. Cost-type contracts are typically billed to the customer on a monthly or semi-monthly basis.\nContract assets are equivalent to and reflected as Unbilled receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position and are primarily related to long-term contracts where revenue recognized under the cost-to-cost method exceeds amounts billed to customers. Unbilled receivables are classified as current assets and include amounts that may be billed and collected beyond one year due to the long-cycle nature of many of our contracts. Accumulated contract costs in unbilled receivables include costs such as direct production costs, factory and engineering overhead, production tooling costs, and allowable G&A. Unbilled receivables also include certain estimates of variable consideration described above. These contract assets are not considered a significant financing component of the company’s contracts as the payment terms are intended to protect the customer in the event the company does not perform on its obligations under the contract.\n-57-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nContract liabilities are equivalent to and reflected as Advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred in the consolidated statements of financial position. Certain customers make advance payments prior to the company’s satisfaction of its obligations on the contract. These amounts are recorded as contract liabilities until such obligations are satisfied, either over time as costs are incurred or at a point in time when deliveries are made. Contract liabilities are not a significant financing component as they are generally utilized to pay for contract costs within a one-year period or are used to ensure the customer meets contractual requirements.\nNet contract assets are as follows:\nThe change in the balances of the company’s contract assets and liabilities primarily results from timing differences between revenue recognition and customer billings and/or payments. Net contract assets as of December 31, 2023 decreased\n37\npercent from the prior year, primarily due to decreases in net contracts assets at Space Systems, Missions Systems and Aeronautics Systems.\nThe amount of revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of each year was $\n3.1\nbillion, $\n2.4\nbillion and $\n2.0\nbillion, respectively.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nSee Note 16 for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments. We believe those categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIn accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements, most general management and corporate expenses incurred at the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs to our U.S. government contracts. Allowable and allocable G&A costs, including independent research and development (IR&D) and bid and proposal (B&P) costs, are allocated on a systematic basis to contracts in progress and are included as a component of total estimated contract costs.\nResearch and Development\nCompany-sponsored research and development activities primarily include efforts related to government programs.\nCompany-sponsored IR&D expenses totaled $\n1.2\nbillion, $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represented\n3.0\npercent,\n3.3\npercent and\n3.2\npercent of total sales, respectively.\nCustomer-funded research and development activities are charged directly to the related contracts.\nIncome Taxes\nProvisions for federal and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. The company recognizes federal and foreign interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Federal tax penalties are also recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nIn accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements, current state and local income and franchise taxes are generally considered allowable and allocable costs to our U.S. government contracts and are, therefore, recorded in operating costs and expenses. The company generally recognizes changes in deferred state taxes and unrecognized state tax benefits in unallocated corporate expenses.\nUncertain tax positions reflect the company’s expected treatment of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. Until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities or the statute of limitations concerning such issues lapses, the company does not generally recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and reports the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in its consolidated statements of financial position.\n-58-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash in banks and highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less, primarily consisting of bank time deposits and investments in institutional money market funds. Cash in bank accounts often exceeds federally insured limits.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe company measures the fair value of its financial instruments using observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions.\nThese two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\nLevel 3 - Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\nThe company holds a portfolio of marketable securities to partially fund non-qualified employee benefit plans. A portion of these securities are held in common/collective trust funds and are measured at fair value using NAV per share as a practical expedient.\nMarketable securities accounted for as trading are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in Other non-current assets in the consolidated statements of financial position. Changes in unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income. Investments in held-to-maturity instruments with original maturities greater than three months are recorded at amortized cost.\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in Other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, while changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income until settlement. For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments, gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in Other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.\nThe company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies (i.e., foreign currency forward contracts). For foreign currency forward contracts, where model-derived valuations are appropriate, the company utilizes the income approach to determine the fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and our counterparties’ credit risks.\nThe company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor does it use leveraged financial instruments. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered minimal and is managed through the use of multiple counterparties with high credit standards and periodic settlements of positions, as well as by entering into master netting agreements with most of our counterparties.\nInventoried Costs\nInventoried costs generally comprise costs associated with unsatisfied performance obligations on contracts accounted for using point in time revenue recognition, costs incurred in excess of existing contract requirements that are probable of recovery and other accrued contract costs that are expected to be recoverable when allocated to specific contracts. Product inventory primarily consists of raw materials and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, generally using the average cost method.\nInventoried costs include direct production costs, factory and engineering overhead, production tooling costs, and allowable G&A. G&A included in Inventoried costs, net was $\n65\nmillion and $\n59\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Inventoried costs are classified as current assets and include amounts related to contracts having production cycles longer than one year due to the long-cycle nature of our business.\nCash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Policies\nThe company maintains whole life insurance policies on a group of executives, which are recorded at their cash surrender value as determined by the insurance carrier. The company also has split-dollar life insurance policies on former officers and executives from acquired businesses, which are recorded at the lesser of their cash surrender value or premiums paid. These policies are utilized as a partial funding source for deferred compensation and other\n-59-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nnon-qualified employee retirement plans.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying values associated with these policies were $\n399\nmillion and $\n367\nmillion, respectively, and are recorded in Other non-current assets in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of individual assets. Machinery and other equipment is primarily depreciated using declining-balance methods. The other asset categories are generally depreciated using the straight-line method. Depreciation expense is generally an allowable and allocable cost in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements and is recorded in the same segment where the related assets are held. However, the additional depreciation expense related to the step-up in fair value of PP&E acquired through business combinations is recorded in unallocated corporate expense within operating income as such depreciation is not allocable to government contracts and not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance.\nMajor classes of PP&E and their useful lives are as follows:\n(1)\nLand is not a depreciable asset.\n(2)\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the company completed a sale of equipment to a customer on a restricted Aeronautics Systems program for $\n444\nmillion. The company previously intended to use the equipment for internal purposes so we recognized the acquisition costs as capital expenditures and included the equipment in PP&E. As we regularly sell this type of equipment to customers in the ordinary course of business, we recorded the sale as a revenue transaction and included the net book value of the equipment in Operating costs and expenses. Although we generally classify proceeds from revenue transactions as cash inflows from operating activities, we recognized the proceeds from this transaction as cash inflows from investing activities, consistent with our prior recognition of the cost to acquire the equipment as capital expenditures. The company received cash payments of $\n155\nmillion and $\n84\nmillion related to the equipment sale during 2022 and 2021, respectively, and included it in Proceeds from sale of equipment to a customer in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The company received no cash payments in 2023 related to the equipment sale.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the company acquired $\n46\nmillion of internal use software through long-term financing directly with the supplier. The software was recorded in PP&E as a non-cash investing activity and the related liability was recorded in long-term debt as a non-cash financing activity. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the company received lease incentives for landlord funded leasehold improvements of $\n55\nmillion and $\n96\nmillion, respectively, related to Space Systems real estate leases, which were recorded in PP&E and included in non-cash investing activities.\nOn December 28, 2022 the company acquired certain leased land in exchange for company-owned land, which had been used previously for production-related activities at Space Systems. The exchange was accounted for as a nonmonetary transaction, and the acquired land, valued at approximately $\n155\nmillion, was recorded in PP&E as a non-cash investing activity. The transaction resulted in a $\n96\nmillion gain, which was reflected in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.\nNon-cash investing activities also include capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid of $\n75\nmillion, $\n113\nmillion and $\n91\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSale of Minority Investment\nIn July 2023, the company sold its minority investment in an Australian business for AUD $\n235\nmillion (the equivalent of $\n157\nmillion upon settlement). The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $\n97\nmillion, which is reflected in\n-60-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nOther, net on the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2023. Proceeds from the sale are included in investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGoodwill and Other Purchased Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and other purchased intangible asset balances are included in the identifiable assets of their assigned business segment. However, the company includes the amortization of other purchased intangible assets in unallocated corporate expense within operating income as such amortization is not allocable to government contracts and not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance. The company’s customer-related intangible assets are generally amortized over their respective useful lives based on the pattern in which the future economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be consumed. Other intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nLeases\nThe company leases certain buildings, land and equipment. At contract inception, we determine whether a contract is or contains a lease and whether the lease should be classified as an operating or finance lease. Operating lease balances are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Other current liabilities, and Operating lease liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position.\nThe company recognizes operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date to determine the present value of future payments and the appropriate lease classification. Many of our leases include renewal options aligned with our contract terms. We define the initial lease term to include renewal options determined to be reasonably certain. We do not recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We elected the practical expedient to not separate lease components from nonlease components and applied that practical expedient to all material classes of leased assets.\nMany of the company’s real property lease agreements contain incentives for tenant improvements, rent holidays or rent escalation clauses. For tenant improvement incentives received, if the incentive is determined to be a leasehold improvement owned by the lessee, the company generally records the incentives as a reduction to the right-of-use asset, which reduces rent expense over the lease term. For rent holidays and rent escalation clauses during the lease term, the company records rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For these lease incentives, the company uses the date of initial possession as the commencement date, which is generally when the company is given the right of access to the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for intended use.\nFinance leases are not material to our consolidated financial statements and the company is not a lessor in any material arrangements. We do not have any material restrictions or covenants in our lease agreements, sale-leaseback transactions, land easements or residual value guarantees.\nLitigation, Commitments and Contingencies\nWe accrue for litigation, commitments and contingencies when management, after considering the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to management, has determined it is probable a liability will be found to have been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of amounts is reasonably estimable and no amount within the range is more likely than another, the low end of the range is recorded. Legal fees are generally expensed as incurred. Due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding gain contingencies, we generally do not recognize potential gains until realized.\nEnvironmental Costs\nWe accrue for environmental liabilities when management determines that, based on the facts and circumstances known to the company, it is probable the company will incur costs to address environmental impacts and the costs are reasonably estimable. When only a range of amounts is reasonably estimable and no amount within the range is more likely than another, we record the low end of the range. The company typically projects environmental costs for up to 30 years, records environmental liabilities on an undiscounted basis, and excludes asset retirement obligations and certain legal costs. At sites involving multiple parties, we accrue environmental liabilities based upon our expected share of liability, taking into account the financial viability of other liable parties.\nRetirement Benefits\nThe company sponsors various defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all of its employees. In most cases, our defined contribution plans provide for a company match of\n-61-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nemployee contributions. The company also provides postretirement benefits other than pensions to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, consisting principally of health care and life insurance benefits.\nThe liabilities, unamortized prior service credits and annual income or expense of the company’s defined benefit pension and OPB plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions.\nBecause U.S. government regulations provide for the costs of pension and OPB plans to be charged to our contracts in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements, we calculate retiree benefit plan costs under both FAS and CAS methods. While both FAS and CAS recognize a normal service cost component in measuring periodic pension cost, there are differences in the way the components of annual pension costs are calculated under each method. Measuring plan obligations under FAS and CAS includes different assumptions and models, such as in estimating returns on plan assets, calculating interest expense and the periods over which gains/losses related to pension assets and actuarial changes are recognized. As a result, annual retiree benefit plan expense amounts for FAS are different from the amounts for CAS in any given reporting period even though the ultimate cost of providing benefits over the life of the plans is the same under either method. CAS retiree benefit plan costs are charged to contracts and are included in segment operating income, and the difference between the service cost component of FAS expense and total CAS expense (the “FAS/CAS operating adjustment”) is recorded in operating income at the consolidated company level. Not all net periodic pension expense is recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated as production costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of any given reporting period.\nActuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in net periodic benefit cost for FAS through MTM (expense) benefit upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. Prior service credits are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized into earnings in future periods.\nStock Compensation\nThe company’s stock compensation plans are classified as equity plans. Compensation expense for stock awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period (generally\nthree years\n), net of estimated forfeitures. The company issues stock awards in the form of restricted performance stock rights and restricted stock rights. The fair value of stock awards and performance stock awards is determined based on the closing market price of the company’s common stock on the grant date. The fair value of market-based stock awards is determined at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For purposes of measuring compensation expense for performance awards, the number of shares ultimately expected to vest is estimated at each reporting date based on management’s expectations regarding the relevant performance criteria. At each reporting date, the number of shares used to calculate compensation expense and diluted earnings per share is adjusted to reflect the number ultimately expected to vest.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, are as follows:\nRelated Party Transactions\nFor all periods presented, the company had no material related party transactions.\n-62-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nAccounting Standards Updates\nOn November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\nAmong other new disclosure requirements, ASU 2023-07 requires companies to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2024 and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2025. ASU 2023-07 must be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are evaluating the disclosure impact of ASU 2023-07; however, the standard will not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and/ or cash flows.\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. ASU 2023-09 requires companies to disclose, on an annual basis, specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. In addition, ASU 2023-09 requires companies to disclose additional information about income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 will be effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2025 and will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. We are evaluating the disclosure impact of ASU 2023-09; however, the standard will not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOther accounting standards updates adopted and/or issued, but not effective until after December 31, 2023, are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\n2.   DISPOSITIONS\nDisposition of IT and Mission Support Services Business\nEffective January 30, 2021, we completed the IT services divestiture for $\n3.4\nbillion in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n2.0\nbillion. The IT and mission support services business was comprised of the majority of the former Information Solutions and Services (IS&S) division of Defense Systems (excluding the Vinnell Arabia business); select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, which were part of the former Cyber and Intelligence Mission Solutions (CIMS) division of Mission Systems; and the former Space Technical Services business unit of Space Systems. Operating results include sales and operating income for the IT and mission support services business prior to the Divestiture date; therefore, no sales and operating income were recognized for this business during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The company recorded sales of $\n162\nmillion and pre-tax profit of $\n20\nmillion for the IT and mission support services business during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n3.   EARNINGS PER SHARE, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK\nBasic Earnings Per Share\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\nDiluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect of awards granted to employees under stock-based compensation plans.\nThe dilutive effect of these securities totaled\n0.5\nmillion,\n0.7\nmillion and\n0.6\nmillion shares for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nShare Repurchases\nShare Repurchase Programs\nOn December 4, 2018, the company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $\n3.0\nbillion in share repurchases of the company’s common stock (the “2018 Repurchase Program”). Repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Program commenced in March 2020 and were completed in October 2021.\nOn January 25, 2021, the company’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to an additional $\n3.0\nbillion in share repurchases of the company’s common stock (the “2021 Repurchase Program”). Repurchases under the 2021 Repurchase Program commenced in October 2021 and were completed in April 2023.\n-63-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nOn January 24, 2022, the company’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to an additional $\n2.0\nbillion in share repurchases of the company’s common stock (the “2022 Repurchase Program”). Repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program commenced in April 2023 upon completion of the 2021 Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2023, repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program totaled $\n0.9\nbillion; $\n1.1\nbillion remained under this share repurchase authorization. By its terms, the 2022 Repurchase Program will expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchases.\nOn December 6, 2023, the company’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to an additional $\n2.5\nbillion in share repurchases of the company’s common stock (the “2023 Repurchase Program”). Repurchases under the 2023 Repurchase Program will commence upon completion of the 2022 Repurchase Program and will expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchases. As of December 31, 2023, there have been no repurchases under the 2023 Repurchase Program and the company’s total outstanding share repurchase authorization was $\n3.6\nbillion.\nAccelerated Share Repurchase Agreements\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (Goldman Sachs) to repurchase $\n2.0 billion\nof the company’s common stock as part of the 2018 Repurchase Program. Under the agreement, we made a payment of $\n2.0\nbillion to Goldman Sachs and received an initial delivery of\n5.9\nmillion shares valued at $\n1.7\nbillion that were immediately canceled by the company. The remaining balance of $\n300\nmillion was settled on June 1, 2021 with a final delivery of\n0.2\nmillion shares from Goldman Sachs. The final average purchase price was $\n327.29\nper share.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the company entered into an ASR agreement with Goldman Sachs to repurchase $\n500 million\nof the company’s common stock as part of the 2021 Repurchase Program. Under the agreement, we made a payment of $\n500\nmillion to Goldman Sachs and received an initial delivery of\n1.2\nmillion shares valued at $\n425\nmillion that were immediately canceled by the company. The remaining balance of $\n75\nmillion was settled on February 1, 2022 with a final delivery of\n0.1\nmillion shares from Goldman Sachs. The final average purchase price was $\n374.79\nper share.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the company entered into an ASR agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America) to repurchase $\n500 million\nof the company’s common stock as part of the 2021 and 2022 Repurchase Programs. Under the agreement, we made a payment of $\n500\nmillion to Bank of America and received an initial delivery of\n0.9\nmillion shares valued at $\n400\nmillion that were immediately canceled by the company. The remaining balance of $\n100\nmillion was settled on April 27, 2023 with a final delivery of\n0.2\nmillion shares from Bank of America. The final average purchase price was $\n458.28\nper share.\nShare repurchases take place from time to time, subject to market and regulatory conditions and management’s discretion, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The company retires its common stock upon repurchase and, in the periods presented, has not made any purchases of common stock other than in connection with these publicly announced repurchase programs.\nThe table below summarizes the company’s share repurchases to date under the authorizations described above:\n(1)\nAs a part of the 2023 Repurchase Program, the board of directors approved that the purchases under this program, and the authorization remaining under the 2022 program, be exclusive of brokerage commissions. Commissions paid are included for the 2018 and 2021 Repurchase Programs.\n-64-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nDividends on Common Stock\nIn May 2023, the company increased the quarterly common stock dividend\n8\npercent to $\n1.87\nper share from the previous amount of $\n1.73\nper share.\nIn May 2022, the company increased the quarterly common stock dividend\n10\npercent to $\n1.73\nper share from the previous amount of $\n1.57\nper share.\nIn May 2021, the company increased the quarterly common stock dividend\n8\npercent to $\n1.57\nper share from the previous amount of $\n1.45\nper share.\n4.   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\nAccounts receivable, net represent amounts billed and due from customers.\nSubstantially all accounts receivable at December 31, 2023 are expected to be collected in 2024. The company does not believe it has significant exposure to credit risk as the majority of our accounts receivable are due from the U.S. government either as the ultimate customer or in connection with foreign military sales.\nAccounts receivable, net consisted of the following:\n(1)\nIncludes receivables due from the U.S. government associated with foreign military sales, which are contracted with and paid by the U.S. government.\n5.   UNBILLED RECEIVABLES, NET\nUnbilled receivables, net represent revenue recognized under the cost-to-cost method that exceeds amounts billed to customers.\nA large majority of the company’s unbilled receivables at December 31, 2023 are expected to be billed and collected in 2024. Progress and performance-based payments are reflected as an offset to the related unbilled receivable balances.\nUnbilled receivables, net consisted of the following:\n(1)\nIncludes unbilled receivables due from the U.S. government associated with foreign military sales, which are contracted with and paid by the U.S. government.\n-65-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n6.   INVENTORIED COSTS, NET\nInventoried costs are principally associated with contracts where the U.S. government is the primary customer, therefore the company does not believe it has significant exposure to recoverability risk related to these amounts. Inventoried costs associated with our commercial businesses, while less significant in total, are subject to a greater level of recoverability risk. The company recorded write-downs of commercial business inventory at Space Systems for which its cost exceeded net realizable value of $\n43\nmillion and $\n45\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As discussed in Note 1, the company recognized a $\n45\nmillion reduction of inventoried costs related to the B-21 program at Aeronautics Systems during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nInventoried costs, net consisted of the following:\n7.   INCOME TAXES\nFederal and foreign income tax expense consisted of the following:\nEarnings before income taxes associated with the company’s foreign operations are not material in the periods presented.\n-66-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nIncome tax expense differs from the amount computed by multiplying earnings before income taxes by the statutory federal income tax rate due to the following:\nThe 2023 ETR decreased to\n12.4\npercent from\n16.1\npercent in 2022 primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes as a result of the B-21 charge and MTM expense, which collectively reduced the 2023 ETR by\n3.8\npercentage points. The 2022 MTM benefit increased the 2022 ETR by\n1.2\npercentage points.\nThe 2022 ETR decreased to\n16.1\npercent from\n21.6\npercent in 2021\nprimarily due to an $\n86\nmillion benefit resulting from the resolution of the IRS examination of certain legacy OATK tax returns, as well as additional federal income taxes in the prior year resulting from the IT services divestiture. The company’s 2022 MTM benefit increased the\n2022\nETR by\n1.2\npercentage points; however, the MTM benefit in\n2021\ndid not significantly impact the\n2021\nETR.\nIncome tax payments, net of refunds received, were $\n1.2\nbillion, $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.3\nbillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Taxes receivable, which are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated statements of financial position, were $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n850\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Northrop Grumman 2018-2020 federal tax returns are currently under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination. During the second quarter of 2023, the company entered into an agreed Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) for certain matters related to the company’s 2014-2017 federal income tax returns, resulting in a $\n90\nmillion reduction to our unrecognized tax benefits and an immaterial impact to income tax expense. The matters not addressed by the agreed RAR related to the company’s 2014-2017 federal income tax returns and refund claims related to its 2007-2016 federal tax returns are currently under review by the IRS Appeals Office.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the California Franchise Tax Board approved a resolution of the state examination primarily related to California state apportionment in the company’s 2007 to 2016 tax years, resulting in a $\n95\nmillion reduction to our unrecognized tax benefits and an $\n11\nmillion reduction to unallocated corporate expense.\nTax returns for open tax years related to state and foreign jurisdictions remain subject to examination. As state income taxes are generally considered allowable and allocable costs, any individual or aggregate state examination impacts are not expected to have a material impact on our financial results. Amounts currently subject to examination related to foreign jurisdictions are not material.\n-67-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe change in unrecognized tax benefits during 2023, 2022 and 2021, excluding interest, is as follows:\nOur 2023 increase in unrecognized tax benefits was primarily related to our methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes related final revenue recognition regulations issued in December 2020 under IRC Section 451(b) and procedural guidance issued in August 2021. As of December 31, 2023, we have approximately $\n2.0\nbillion in unrecognized tax benefits, including $\n843\nmillion related to our position on IRC Section 451(b). If these matters, including our position on IRC Section 451(b), are unfavorably resolved, there could be a material impact on our future cash flows. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months our unrecognized tax benefits related to these matters may increase by approximately $\n120\nmillion.\nOur current unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in Other current liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position, were $\n964\nmillion and $\n728\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits included within Other non-current liabilities. These liabilities include $\n305\nmillion and $\n216\nmillion of accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If the income tax benefits from these tax positions are ultimately realized, $\n848\nmillion of federal and foreign tax benefits would reduce the company’s ETR.\nNet interest expense within the company’s federal, foreign and state income tax provisions was $\n62\nmillion, $\n29\nmillion, and $\n25\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n-68-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes. Net deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to year-end deferred federal, state and foreign tax balances, as presented in the consolidated statements of financial position, are as follows:\nRealization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. The company believes it is more-likely-than-not our net deferred tax assets will be realized.\nAt December 31, 2023, the company has available tax credits and unused net operating losses of $\n615\nmillion and $\n358\nmillion, respectively, that may be applied against future taxable income. The majority of tax credits and net operating losses expire in 2024 through 2046, however, some may be carried forward indefinitely. Due to the uncertainty of the realization of the tax credits and net operating losses, the company has recorded valuation allowances of $\n344\nmillion and $\n46\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\nUndistributed Foreign Earnings\nAs of December 31, 2023, the company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries and most have been taxed in the U.S. We intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings, as well as future earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to fund our international operations. In addition, we expect future U.S. cash generation will be sufficient to meet future U.S. cash needs.\n-69-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n8.   GOODWILL AND OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nChanges in the carrying amounts of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, were as follows:\n(1)\nOther consists primarily of adjustments for foreign currency translation.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, accumulated goodwill impairment losses totaled $\n417\nmillion and $\n153\nmillion at Aeronautics Systems and Space Systems, respectively.\nOther Purchased Intangible Assets\nNet customer-related and other intangible assets are as follows:\nAmortization expense for 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $\n80\nmillion, $\n197\nmillion and $\n204\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the expected future amortization of purchased intangibles for each of the next five years is as follows:\n9.   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe following table presents the financial assets and liabilities the company records at fair value on a recurring basis identified by the level of inputs used to determine fair value. See Note 1 for the definitions of these levels and for further information on our financial instruments.\n-70-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe notional value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n286\nmillion and $\n221\nmillion, respectively. The portion of notional value designated as a cash flow hedge at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n162\nmillion and $\n87\nmillion, respectively.\nThe derivative fair values and related unrealized gains/losses at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nThere were no transfers of financial instruments into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and commercial paper approximates fair value.\n10.   DEBT\nCommercial Paper\nThe company maintains a commercial paper program that serves as a source of short-term financing with capacity to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to $\n2.5\nbillion. There were\nno\ncommercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nCredit Facility\nThe company maintains a five-year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $\n2.5\nbillion (the “2022 Credit Agreement”) that matures in August 2027. The revolving credit facility established under the 2022 Credit Agreement is intended to support the company’s commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. Commercial paper borrowings reduce the amount available for borrowing under the 2022 Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2023, there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under this facility.\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement contains generally customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting the company’s ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets, merge or consolidate with another entity or undertake other fundamental changes and incur liens.\nThe company also cannot permit the ratio of its debt to capitalization (as set forth in the credit agreement) to exceed 65 percent.\nAt December 31, 2023,\nthe company was in compliance with all covenants under its credit agreement.\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nIssuance of Senior Notes\nIn February 2023, the company issued $\n2.0\nbillion of unsecured senior notes for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment, share repurchases, and working capital, as follows:\n•\n$\n1.0\nbillion of\n4.70\n% senior notes due 2033 (the “2033 Notes”) and\n•\n$\n1.0\nbillion of\n4.95\n% senior notes due 2053 (the “2053 Notes”).\nWe refer to the 2033 Notes and the 2053 Notes, together, as the “notes.” Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes are generally subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the company’s discretion at any time, or from time to time, prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or an applicable “make-whole” amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nRepayments of Senior Notes\nIn August 2023, the company repaid $\n1.05\nbillion of\n3.25\npercent unsecured senior notes upon maturity.\nIn March 2021, the company repaid $\n700\nmillion of\n3.50\npercent unsecured notes upon maturity.\nIn March 2021, the company redeemed $\n1.5\nbillion of\n2.55\npercent unsecured notes due October 2022. The company recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n54\nmillion principally related to the premium paid on the redemption, which was recorded in Other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.\nDebt Exchange\nOn September 2, 2021, the company completed an exchange offer to eligible holders of the outstanding notes of our direct wholly owned subsidiary, Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (“NGSC”), maturing through 2036. An aggregate principal amount of $\n422\nmillion of the NGSC notes was exchanged for $\n422\nmillion of unregistered Northrop Grumman Corporation notes (the “Unregistered Notes”) with the same interest rates and maturity dates as the NGSC notes exchanged.\nOn June 15, 2022, the company completed a registered exchange offer pursuant to which the company exchanged an aggregate principal amount of $\n414\nmillion of the Unregistered Notes for $\n414\nmillion of new notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Registered Notes”) with the same interest rates and maturity dates as the Unregistered Notes.\n-71-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nBecause the debt instruments were not substantially different in either of the exchange offers, both exchanges were treated as debt modifications for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized.\nLong-term debt consists of the following:\n(1)\nThe current portion of long-term debt is recorded in Other current liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nThe estimated fair value of long-term debt was $\n13.4\nbillion and $\n12.1\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe calculated the fair value of long-term debt using Level 2 inputs, based on interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the company’s existing debt arrangements.\nIndentures underlying long-term debt issued by the company or its subsidiaries contain various restrictions with respect to the issuer, including one or more restrictions relating to limitations on liens, sale-leaseback arrangements and funded debt of subsidiaries. The majority of these fixed rate notes and debentures are subject to redemption at the company’s discretion at any time prior to maturity in whole or in part at the principal amount plus any make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on these fixed rate notes and debentures are payable semi-annually in arrears.\nTotal interest payments, net of interest received and capitalized, were $\n437\nmillion, $\n474\nmillion and $\n570\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The company capitalized interest expense of $\n95\nmillion, $\n53\nmillion and $\n17\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n-72-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nMaturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2023, are as follows:\n11.   INVESTIGATIONS, CLAIMS AND LITIGATION\nFor over 25 years, the company has worked closely with the United States Navy, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the New York State Department of Health and other federal, state and local governmental authorities, to address environmental conditions allegedly resulting from historic operations at the former United States Navy and Grumman facilities in Bethpage, New York. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, as included in Note 12, substantial remediation costs related to these Bethpage environmental conditions. It is also possible that applicable remediation standards and other requirements to which we are subject may continue to change, and that our costs may increase materially. In 2022, we resolved several disputes and regulatory proceedings concerning the scope and allocation of remediation responsibilities and costs related to this site. The company continues to be involved in related disputes, none of which are material individually or in the aggregate. We are also a party to various individual lawsuits and a putative class action in the Eastern District of New York alleging personal injury and property damage related to the legacy Bethpage environmental conditions. The court has stayed the filed individual lawsuits, pending its decision on class certification. We are also a party, and may become a party, to other lawsuits brought by or against insurance carriers, and by other individual plaintiffs and/or putative classes, as well as other parties. We cannot at this time predict or reasonably estimate the potential cumulative outcomes or ranges of possible liability of these Bethpage lawsuits\n.\nThe company received from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) a criminal subpoena on December 9, 2022, and a civil investigative demand on February 2, 2023, both seeking information regarding financial and cost accounting and controls that appears focused on the interest rate assumptions the company used to determine our CAS pension expense, which we discuss in Note 12 below. The company is engaging with the government and responding to the requests. We cannot at this point predict the outcome of these matters.\nThe company is a party to various other investigations, lawsuits, arbitration, claims, enforcement actions and other legal proceedings, including government investigations and claims, that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The nature of legal proceedings is such that we cannot assure the outcome of any particular matter. However, based on information available to the company to date, the company does not believe that the outcome of any of these other matters pending against the company is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2023, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\n12.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nU.S. Government Cost Claims and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the company is advised of claims by the U.S. government concerning certain potential disallowed costs, plus, at times, penalties and interest. When such findings are presented, the company and U.S. government representatives engage in discussions to enable the company to evaluate the merits of these claims, as well as to assess the amounts being claimed. Where appropriate, provisions are made to reflect the company’s estimated exposure for such potential disallowed costs. Such provisions are reviewed periodically using the most recent information available. The company believes it has adequately reserved for disputed amounts that are probable and reasonably estimable, and that the outcome of any such matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position\nas of December 31, 2023, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\n-73-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nIn 2019, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) raised questions about an interest rate assumption used by the company to determine our CAS pension expense. On June 1, 2020, DCMA provided written notice that the assumptions the company used during the period 2013-2019 were potentially noncompliant with CAS. We submitted a formal response on July 31, 2020, which we believed demonstrates the appropriateness of the assumptions used. On November 24, 2020, DCMA replied to the company’s response, disagreeing with our position and requesting additional input, which we provided on February 22, 2021. We have continued to exchange correspondence and engage with DCMA on this matter, including responding to requests for and providing additional information. As noted in Note 11 above, the company received from the DOJ a criminal subpoena on December 9, 2022, and a CID on February 2, 2023, both seeking information that appears related to the interest rate assumptions at issue in our discussions with DCMA. The company is engaging with the government and responding to the requests. We cannot at this point predict the outcome of these matters.\nAs previously described, the sensitivity to changes in interest rate assumptions makes it reasonably possible the outcome of the DCMA matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows, although we are not currently able to estimate a range of any potential loss.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe table below summarizes the amount accrued for environmental remediation costs, management’s estimate of the amount of reasonably possible future costs in excess of accrued costs and the deferred costs expected to be recoverable through overhead charges on U.S. government contracts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2023, $\n223\nmillion is recorded in Other current liabilities and $\n361\nmillion is recorded in Other non-current liabilities.\n(2)\nEstimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value. The reasonably possible future costs in excess of accrued costs do not take into consideration amounts expected to be recoverable through overhead charges on U.S. government contracts.\n(3)\nAs of December 31, 2023, $\n206\nmillion is deferred in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and $\n312\nmillion is deferred in Other non-current assets.\nThese amounts are evaluated for recoverability on a routine basis.\nAlthough management cannot predict whether (i) new information gained as our environmental remediation projects progress, (ii) changes in remediation standards or other requirements to which we are subject, or (iii) other changes in facts and circumstances will materially affect the estimated liability accrued, we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures associated with our currently identified projects will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2023, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\nFinancial Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued principally by insurance companies to guarantee the performance on certain obligations. At December 31, 2023, there were $\n411\nmillion of stand-by letters of credit and guarantees and $\n263\nmillion of surety bonds outstanding.\nIndemnifications\nThe company has provided indemnifications for certain environmental, income tax and other potential liabilities in connection with certain of its divestitures. The settlement of these liabilities is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2023, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\n13.   RETIREMENT BENEFITS\nPlan Descriptions\nU.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n– The company sponsors several defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. Pension benefits for most participants are based on years of service, age and compensation. It is our policy to fund at\n-74-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nleast the minimum amount required for qualified plans, using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable under U.S. government regulations, by making payments into benefit trusts separate from the company.\nU.S. Defined Contribution Plans\n– The company also sponsors defined contribution plans covering the majority of its employees, including certain employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Company contributions vary depending on date of hire, with a majority of employees being eligible for employer matching of employee contributions. Based on date of hire, certain employees are eligible to receive a company non-elective contribution or an enhanced matching contribution in lieu of a defined benefit pension plan benefit. The company’s contributions to these defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were $\n634\nmillion, $\n558\nmillion and $\n588\nmillion, respectively.\nNon-U.S. Benefit Plans –\nThe company sponsors several benefit plans for non-U.S. employees. These plans are designed to provide benefits appropriate to local practice and in accordance with local regulations. Some of these plans are funded using benefit trusts separate from the company.\nMedical and Life Benefits\n– The company funds a portion of the costs for certain health care and life insurance benefits for a substantial number of its active and retired employees. In addition to a company and employee cost-sharing feature, the health plans also have provisions for deductibles, co-payments, coinsurance percentages, out-of-pocket limits, conformance to a schedule of reasonable fees, the use of managed care providers and coordination of benefits with other plans. The plans also provide for a Medicare carve-out. The company reserves the right to amend or terminate the plans at any time.\nCertain covered employees and dependents are eligible to participate in plans upon retirement if they meet specified age and years of service requirements. The company provides subsidies to reimburse certain retirees for a portion of the cost of individual Medicare-supplemental coverage purchased directly by the retiree through a private insurance exchange. The company has capped the amount of its contributions for substantially all of its remaining postretirement medical and life benefit plans. In addition, after January 1, 2005 (or earlier at some businesses), newly hired employees are not eligible for subsidized postretirement medical and life benefits.\nSummary Plan Results\nThe cost to the company of its retirement benefit plans is shown in the following table:\n-75-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe table below summarizes the components of changes in unamortized prior service credit (cost) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023:\nThe following table sets forth the funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position for the company’s defined benefit retirement plans. Pension benefits data includes the qualified plans, foreign plans and U.S. unfunded non-qualified plans for benefits provided to directors, officers and certain employees. The company uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.\nThe increase in the fair value of our plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2023 was principally driven by net plan asset returns of\n11.1\npercent, partially offset by $\n2.1\nbillion of benefit payments. The increase in our projected benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily driven by $\n1.6\nbillion of interest cost and a\n39\nbasis point decrease in the discount rate from year end 2022, partially offset by $\n2.1\nbillion of benefit payments.\n-76-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n30.1\nbillion and $\n28.8\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAmounts for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of fair value of plan assets are as follows:\nPlan Assumptions\nOn a weighted-average basis, the following assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of each year and net periodic benefit cost for the following year:\nPlan Assets and Investment Policy\nPlan assets are invested in various asset classes that are expected to produce a sufficient level of diversification and investment return over the long term. Liability studies are conducted on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an objective to balance risk. Risk targets are established and monitored against acceptable ranges.\nOur investment policies and procedures are designed to ensure the plans’ investments are in compliance with ERISA. Guidelines are established defining permitted investments within each asset class. Derivatives are used for transitioning assets, asset class rebalancing, managing currency risk and for management of fixed-income and alternative investments.\n-77-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nFor the majority of the plans’ assets, the investment policies require that the asset allocation be maintained within the following ranges as of December 31, 2023:\nThe table below provides the fair values of the company’s pension and Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust plan assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, by asset category. The table also identifies the level of inputs used to determine the fair value of assets in each category. See Note 1 for the definitions of these levels. Certain investments that are measured at fair value using NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be categorized in the fair value hierarchy table. The total fair value of these investments is included in the table below to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to amounts presented in the funded status table. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no investments expected to be sold at a value materially different than NAV.\nThere were no transfers of plan assets into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nGenerally, investments are valued based on information in financial publications of general circulation, statistical and valuation services, records of security exchanges, appraisal by qualified persons, transactions and bona fide offers. Cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in money market or short-term investment funds. U.S. and\n-78-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ninternational equities consist primarily of common stocks and institutional common trust funds. Investments in certain equity securities, which include domestic and international securities and registered investment companies, and exchange-traded funds with fixed income strategies are valued at the last reported sales or quoted price on the last business day of the reporting period. Fair values for certain fixed-income securities, which are not exchange-traded, are valued using third-party pricing services.\nOther assets include derivative assets with a fair value of $\n172\nmillion and $\n71\nmillion, derivative liabilities with a fair value of $\n101\nmillion and $\n117\nmillion, and net notional amounts of $\n4.9\nbillion and $\n3.2\nbillion, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Derivative instruments may include exchange traded futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on futures and swaps, currency contracts, total return swaps and credit default swaps. Notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities of the pension and VEBA trusts, but are used in the calculation of cash settlement under the contracts. The volume of derivative activity is commensurate with the amounts disclosed at year-end. Certain derivative financial instruments within the pension trust are subject to master netting agreements with certain counterparties.\nInvestments in certain equity and fixed-income funds, which include common/collective trust funds, and alternative investments, including hedge funds, opportunistic investments, private equity funds and real estate funds, are valued based on the NAV derived by the investment managers, as a practical expedient, and are described further below.\nU.S. and International equities: Generally, redemption periods are\ndaily, monthly or quarterly\nwith a notice requirement less than\n90\ndays.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\nno\nunfunded commitments.\nFixed-income funds: Generally, redemption periods are\ndaily, monthly or quarterly\nwith a notice requirement of\ntwo days\n. As o\nf December 31, 2023 and 2022 there were\nno\nunfunded commitments.\nHedge funds: Consist of closed-end funds with a\n5\n-\n10\nyear life as well as funds that allow redemption requests subject to the liquidity limitations of the underlying investments.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, unfunded commitments were $\n6\nmillion.\nOpportunistic investments: Primarily held in partnerships with a\n5\n-\n10\nyear life.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, unfunded commitments were $\n1.6\nbillion and $\n1.5\nbillion, respectively.\nPrivate equity funds: The term of each fund is typically\n10\nor more years and the fund’s investors do not have an option to redeem their interest in the fund.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, unfunded commitments were $\n1.9\nbillion and $\n2.0\nbillion, respectively.\nReal estate funds: Consist primarily of open-end funds that generally allow investors to redeem their interests in the funds. Certain closed-end real estate funds have terms of\n10\nor more years. A\ns of December 31, 2023 and 2022, unfunded commitments were $\n28\nmillion and $\n44\nmillion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the defined benefit pension and VEBA trusts did not hold any Northrop Grumman common stock.\nBenefit Payments\nThe following table reflects estimated future benefit payments for the next ten years, based upon the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation, and includes expected future employee service, as of December 31, 2023:\nIn 2024, the company expects to contribute the required minimum funding of approximately $\n99\nmillion to its pension plans and approximately $\n35\nmillion to its medical and life benefit plans. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the company made\nno\ndiscretionary pension contributions.\n-79-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n14.   STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS AND OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS\nStock Compensation Plans\nAt December 31, 2023, the company had stock-based compensation awards outstanding under the following shareholder-approved plans: the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (2011 Plan), applicable to employees and non-employee directors, and the 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (1993 SPND).\nEmployee Plans\n– In May 2015, the company’s shareholders approved amendments to the 2011 Plan. These amendments provided that shares issued under the plan would be counted against the aggregate share limit on a one-for-one basis. As amended,\n5.1\nmillion shares plus\n2.4\nmillion of newly authorized shares were available for issuance under the 2011 Plan; as of December 31, 2023,\n4.4\nmillion shares remain available for issuance.\nThe 2011 Plan provides for the following equity awards: stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs) and stock awards. Under the 2011 Plan, no SARs have been granted and there are no outstanding stock options. Stock awards include restricted performance stock rights (RPSR) and restricted stock rights (RSR). RPSRs generally vest and are paid following the completion of a three-year performance period, based primarily on achievement of certain performance metrics determined by the Board. RSRs generally vest 100% after three years. Each includes dividend equivalents, which are paid concurrently with the RPSR or RSR. The terms of equity awards granted under the 2011 Plan provide for accelerated vesting, and in some instances forfeiture, of all or a portion of an award upon termination of employment.\nNon-Employee Director Plans\n– Awards to non-employee directors are made pursuant to the Northrop Grumman Corporation Equity Grant Program for Non-Employee Directors under the 2011 Plan (the Director Program), which was amended and restated effective January 1, 2016. Under the amended Director Program, each non-employee director is awarded an annual equity grant in the form of Automatic Stock Units, which vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date. Directors may elect to have all or any portion of their Automatic Stock Units paid on (A) the earlier of (i) the beginning of a specified calendar year after the vesting date or (ii) their separation from service as a member of the Board, or (B) on the vesting date.\nDirectors also may elect to defer to a later year all or a portion of their remaining cash retainer or committee retainer fees into a stock unit account as Elective Stock Units or in alternative investment options. Elective Stock Units are awarded on a quarterly basis. Directors may elect to have all or a portion of their Elective Stock Units paid on the earlier of (i) the beginning of a specified calendar year or (ii) their separation from service as a member of the Board. Stock units awarded under the Director Program are paid out in an equivalent number of shares of Northrop Grumman common stock. Directors are credited with dividend equivalents in connection with the accumulated stock units until the shares of common stock relating to such stock units are issued.\nCompensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n87\nmillion, $\n99\nmillion and $\n94\nmillion, respectively. The related tax benefits (deficiencies) for stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $\n9\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion and $(\n2\n) million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2023, there was $\n96\nmillion of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards granted under the company’s stock-based compensation plans. These amounts are expected to be charged to expense over a weighted-average period of\n1.3\nyears.\n-80-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nStock Awards\nStock award activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, is presented in the table below. Vested awards do not include any adjustments to reflect the final performance measure for issued shares.\nThe majority of our stock awards are granted annually during the first quarter.\nThe grant date fair value of shares issued in settlement of fully vested stock awards was $\n99\nmillion, $\n93\nmillion and $\n103\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCash Awards\nThe company grants certain employees cash units (CUs) and cash performance units (CPUs). Depending on actual performance against financial objectives, recipients of CPUs earn between\n0\nand\n200\npercent of the original grant.\nThe following table presents the minimum and maximum aggregate payout amounts related to those cash awards granted for the periods presented:\nThe majority of our cash awards are granted annually during the first quarter. CUs typically vest and settle in cash on the third anniversary of the grant date, while CPUs generally vest and pay out in cash based primarily on the achievement of certain performance metrics over a three-year period. At December 31, 2023, there was $\n116\nmillion of unrecognized compensation expense related to cash awards.\n-81-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n15.   LEASES\nTotal Lease Cost\nTotal lease cost is included in Product and Service costs in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income and is recorded net of immaterial sublease income.\nTotal lease cost is comprised of the following:\nSupplemental Balance Sheet Information\nSupplemental operating lease balance sheet information consists of the following:\nOther Supplemental Information\nOther supplemental operating lease information consists of the following:\n-82-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nMaturities of Lease Liabilities\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have approximately $\n270\nmillion in rental commitments for real estate leases that have not yet commenced. These leases are expected to commence in 2024 and 2025 with lease terms of\n5\nto\n20\nyears.\n16.   SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe company is aligned in\nfour\noperating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems.\nThe following table presents sales and operating income by segment:\n-83-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nFAS/CAS Operating Adjustment\nFor financial statement purposes, we account for our employee pension plans in accordance with FAS. However, the cost of these plans is charged to our contracts in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment reflects the difference between CAS pension expense included as cost in segment operating income and the service cost component of FAS expense included in total operating income.\nUnallocated Corporate (Expense) Income\nUnallocated corporate (expense) income includes the portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable under applicable FAR and CAS requirements, and therefore not allocated to the segments, such as changes in deferred state income taxes and a portion of management and administration, legal, environmental, compensation, retiree benefits, advertising and other corporate unallowable costs. Unallocated corporate (expense) income also includes costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets and the additional depreciation expense related to the step-up in fair value of PP&E acquired through business combinations, as well as certain compensation and other costs.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the $\n2.0\nbillion pre-tax gain on the sale of our IT services business and $\n192\nmillion of unallowable state taxes and transaction costs associated with the divestiture were recorded in Unallocated corporate (expense) income.\n-84-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nDisaggregation of Revenue\n(1)\nSales to the U.S. government include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. government. Each of the company’s segments derives substantial revenue from the U.S. government.\n(2)\nInternational sales include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is an international customer. These sales include foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. government.\n(3)\nPercentages calculated based on total segment sales.\n-85-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n(1)\nPercentages calculated based on external customer sales.\n-86-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n(1)\nAll other is principally comprised of the Middle East.\n(2)\nPercentages calculated based on external customer sales.\n-87-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nIntersegment Sales and Operating Income\nSales between segments are recorded at values that include intercompany operating income for the performing segment based on that segment’s estimated average operating margin rate for external sales. Such intercompany operating income is eliminated in consolidation\n, so that the company’s total sales and total operating income reflect only those transactions with external customers. See Note 1 for additional information.\nThe following table presents intersegment sales and operating income:\nCapital Expenditures and Depreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization by segment:\n(1)\nCorporate amounts include the amortization of purchased intangible assets and the additional depreciation expense related to the step-up in fair value of PP&E acquired through business combinations as they are not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance.\nAssets\nOur chief operating decision maker does not use assets by segment to evaluate segment performance or allocate resources. Therefore, we do not disclose assets by segment.\n-88-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION"

This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. The company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nTo comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, the company designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting across the enterprise. The assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting is based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management regularly monitors its internal control over financial reporting, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP issued an attestation report dated January 24, 2024, concerning the company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is contained in this Annual Report. The company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\n/s/   Kathy J. Warden\nChair, Chief Executive Officer and President\n/s/   David F. Keffer\nCorporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nJanuary 24, 2024\n-89-\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation\nFalls Church, Virginia\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 of the Company and our report dated January 24, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/   Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMcLean, Virginia\nJanuary 24, 2024\n-90-\nCERTAIN TRADING AGREEMENTS\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act)\nadopted\nor\nterminated\na “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement”, as those terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K."
