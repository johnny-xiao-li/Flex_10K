    "text": "Globe Life and the Company refer to Globe Life Inc., an insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware in 1979, and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Its primary subsidiaries are Globe Life And Accident Insurance Company, American Income Life Insurance Company, Liberty National Life Insurance Company, Family Heritage Life Insurance Company of America, and United American Insurance Company.\nGlobe Life's website is: www.globelifeinsurance.com. Globe Life makes available free of charge through its website, its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other information included in Globe Life's website is not incorporated into this filing.\n1\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nThe following table presents Globe Life's business by primary marketing distribution method. Additional information concerning industry segments may be found in\nand in\nwithin the\n.\n2\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nInsurance\nLife Insurance\nThe distribution channels for life insurance products include direct to consumer, exclusive agents, and independent agents. These methods are described in greater detail within the primary marketing distribution channel chart as shown above. The following table presents annualized premium in force for the three years ended December 31, 2023 by distribution method:\n(1)\nSee definition of annualized premium in force under\n.\nGlobe Life's insurance subsidiaries write a variety of nonparticipating ordinary life insurance products. These include traditional whole life, term life, and other life insurance. The Company does not currently sell interest-sensitive whole life products. The following tables present selected information about Globe Life's life insurance products.\n3\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nHealth Insurance\nThe following table presents Globe Life's health insurance annualized premium in force for the three years ended December 31, 2023 by distribution channel.\nGlobe Life offers Medicare Supplement and limited-benefit supplemental health insurance products that include accident, cancer, critical illness, heart, and intensive care products. These products are designed to supplement health coverage that applicants already own. Medicare Supplements are offered to enrollees in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. Medicare Supplement plans are standardized by federal regulation and are designed to pay deductibles and co-payments not paid by Medicare.\nThe following table presents supplemental health annualized premium in force information for the three years ended December 31, 2023 by product category.\nAnnuities\nAnnuity products include single-premium and flexible-premium deferred annuities. Annuities in each of the three years ended December 31, 2023, comprised less than 1% of premium. The Company does not currently market stand-alone fixed or deferred annuity products.\nPricing\nPremium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality, morbidity, persistency, investment income, expenses, and target profit margins. These assumptions are based on Company experience and projected investment earnings rates. Revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income, and, to a lesser extent, through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products. Profitability is affected by actual experience deviations from the established assumptions and to the extent investment income varies from that required for policy reserves.\nCollections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues, but are added to policyholder account values. Revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs. Profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs. Profits are also earned from investment income in excess of the amounts required for policy reserves.\n4\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nUnderwriting\nThe underwriting standards of Globe Life's insurance subsidiaries are established by management. Each subsidiary uses information obtained from the application, and in some cases additional information such as, telephone interviews with applicants, inspection reports, pharmacy data, motor vehicle records, responses to both medical and non-medical questions, doctors’ statements and/or medical examinations. This information is used to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application, with a different rating, with a rider, with reduced coverage, or rejected.\nReserves\nThe life insurance policy reserves reflected in Globe Life's consolidated financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These reserves, with future premiums and the associated interest compounded at assumed rates, are expected to be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature. Generally, the mortality and lapse assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on Company experience. Similar reserves are held on most of the health insurance policies written by Globe Life's insurance subsidiaries, since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteed-renewable basis. The assumptions used in the calculation of Globe Life's reserves are reported in\n.\nReserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments.\nReinsurance\nGlobe Life has historically participated in very limited third-party reinsurance as a result of the low face amounts of the policies sold by the Company. See\n,\n,\n,\nand\nfor more information.\nInvestments\nThe nature, quality, and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws. The investments of Globe Life insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of high-quality, investment-grade securities. Approximately 91% of our invested assets, at fair value, are fixed maturities at December 31, 2023 (see\nand\n).\nCompetition\nGlobe Life competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service, price, product design, and sales efforts. While there are insurance companies competing with Globe Life, no individual company dominates any of Globe Life's life or health insurance markets.\nGlobe Life's health insurance products compete with, in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and other health care-related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements.\nThe Company effectively competes with other carriers, in part, due to its ability to operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies. This allows Globe Life to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins.\nRegulation\nInsurance\n—Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include, among other things, granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, approving certain premium rates, setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, determining the form and content of required financial statements, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. Insurance companies are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies, and records of their business are subject to examination at any time. Under the rules of the\n5\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies.\nRisk-Based Capital (RBC)\n—The NAIC requires that a risk-based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers. The risk-based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula. It is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized. All Globe Life's insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk-based capital formula. See further discussion of RBC in\n.\nHolding Company\n—States have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system. Globe Life Inc. and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, and New York.\nInsurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries, and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions.\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\nGlobe Life’s sustainable business practices are a driver of the success and longevity that our Company has experienced since its origin. We plan to advance our sustainable business practices by further developing the Company's ESG strategy and have aligned disclosures with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.\nEnvironmental responsibility and sustainability are key components of our overall corporate responsibility efforts. We strive to reduce our impact on the environment by implementing green building initiatives at our corporate facilities, placing a company-wide emphasis on recycling and reducing waste generally, and focusing on efforts to reduce the use of paper and water. With respect to social matters, our focus continues to be on supporting a culture that is inclusive and attractive for all of our employees and independent sales agents. We are committed to maintaining a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we work. In addition, to enable the Company to appropriately respond to ESG-related challenges and opportunities, the Company has in place an ESG Committee, and the Board and its committees regularly engage with senior management on relevant ESG-related issues.\nHuman Capital Management\nGlobe Life's talent base encompasses a broad range of experience that possesses the depth of critical skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish our business purpose and mission, serve our policyholders, and protect our shareholders' interests. Maintaining superior human capital is a key driver to the success and longevity that our Company has experienced since its origins dating back to the early 1900s. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 3,636 full time, part-time, and temporary employees, a 3% increase over the prior year. The increase in headcount in 2023 was primarily to support the increased growth in recent periods, as well as lower attrition levels than normal. The Company engages over 15,400 independently-contracted insurance agents. Refer to Management's Discussion & Analysis for exclusive agent counts.\nPeople, Culture, and Community\nAt Globe Life, we are united by our mission to—\nMake Tomorrow Better\n1\nand this starts with our employees and agents. Beyond providing insurance protection for millions of individuals, serving our policyholders and generating financial results for our shareholders, we focus on cultivating a healthy, positive culture and a thriving community within and among our campuses that is inclusive of and attractive for all. Globe Life promotes a diverse work force, where differences are celebrated and inclusiveness is embraced, to better enable our employees to consistently achieve outstanding individual and collective results. Our commitment to diversity starts at the top; of the 10 independent Board members, 60% are women and 30% are racial/ethnic minorities as of December 31, 2023.\n1\nPer the Globe Life Employee Handbook, the Globe Life mission statement is \"We help families\nMake Tomorrow Better\nby working to protect their financial future.\"\n6\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Globe Life employees, (excluding independently-contracted agents) identify as follows:\nWe conduct a confidential survey biennially to give our employees the opportunity to provide candid feedback about their experiences at the Company, including but not limited to, confidence in the Company and leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefit package, and departmental relationships. The results are shared with our employees, reviewed by senior leadership, and used to identify areas for improvement and create action plans based on the employee feedback received.\nWe strive to\nMake Tomorrow Bette\nr, in part by giving financial and service contributions to programs that provide hands-on assistance in the communities where we live, work, serve, and visit. We focus our charitable giving on organizations that support children, families, veterans, and seniors, as well as those that work to ensure people are able to live full, healthy lives. These categories align with our mission to help families\nMake Tomorrow Better\nby working to protect their financial future. In 2023, we provided financial support of approximately $4.3 million to organizations within that focus, including charities that support underserved communities, provide scholarships to youth, and advance equity and diversity efforts.\nTalent Development\nAt Globe Life, we believe investing in our employees through training and development is paramount to their success. We have developed a learning ecosystem that includes a multitude of professional development opportunities, including online, self-directed, and instructor-led courses on a variety of topics. An education assistance program is also offered to facilitate growth in an area related to one's current position with the Company.\nHealth, Safety, and Wellness\nWe strive to provide a safe and healthy work environment for every employee. We furnish employees with numerous tools and trainings throughout the year to help ensure they have, at their fingertips, the best information to safely engage with co-workers, customers, and third parties. In furtherance of our commitment to our employees, we offer a comprehensive employee benefits package that includes competitive monetary benefits, retirement\n7\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nbenefits through a Section 401(k) plan and a qualified pension to eligible employees, fitness center reimbursement, paid-time-off (based on years of service), health insurance, dental and vision insurance, employee resource program, health savings and flexible spending accounts, family leave, and tuition assistance.\nThe Company remains committed to the well-being and safety of its employees, agents, customers, guests, vendors and shareholders in our resolve to maintain a stable and secure business environment.\n8\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K"

    "text": "Risks Related to Our Business\nThe following is a summary of the material risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe development and maintenance of our various distribution channels are critical to growth in product sales and profits.\nOur future success depends, in substantial part, on our ability to recruit, hire, and motivate highly-skilled insurance personnel. Further, the development and retention of producing agents are critical to supporting sales growth in our agency operations because our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals.\nA failure to effectively develop new methods of reaching consumers, realize cost efficiencies or generate an attractive value proposition in our Direct to Consumer Division business could result in reduced sales and profits. In addition, if we do not provide an attractive career opportunity with competitive compensation as well as motivation for producing agents to increase sales of our products, our growth could be impeded. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including but not limited to, fluctuations in economic and industry conditions and the effectiveness of our compensation programs and competition among other companies.\nOur life insurance products are sold in niche markets. We are at risk should any of these markets diminish.\nWe have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches, three of which are labor unions, affinity groups, and sales via Direct to Consumer solicitations. Deterioration of our relationships with either organized labor union groups or affinity groups, or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to Direct to Consumer marketing initiatives could negatively affect our life insurance business.\nActual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal, tax or financial consequences.\nA significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors. Although we believe we have properly classified such individuals, a risk nevertheless exists that a court, the Internal Revenue Service or other authority will take the position that our sales agents are employees. From time-to-time, we are subject to civil litigation, including class and collective action litigation, alleging that we have improperly classified certain of our sales agents as independent contractors. A future adverse judgment in connection with such litigation could result in substantial damages. Future changes in rules, regulations or interpretations of existing rules and regulations could require us to reclassify all or a portion of our agents as employees and the impact could significantly increase our operating costs and negatively impact our insurance business.\nThe use of third-party vendors to support the Company's operations makes the Company susceptible to the operational risk of those third parties, which could lower revenues, increase costs, reduce profits, disrupt business, or damage the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company utilizes third-party vendors to provide certain business support services and functions, which exposes the Company to risks outside the control of the Company that may lead to business disruptions. The reliance on these third-party vendors creates a number of business risks, such as the risk that the Company may not maintain service quality, control or effective management of the outsourced business operations and that the Company cannot control the information systems, facilities or networks of such third-party vendors. Additionally, the Company is at risk of being unable to meet legal, regulatory, financial or customer obligations if the information systems, facilities or networks of a third-party vendor are disrupted, damaged or fail, whether due to physical disruptions, such as fire, natural disaster, pandemic or power outage, or due to cybersecurity incidents, ransomware or other impacts to vendors, including labor strikes, political unrest and terrorist attacks. The Company may be adversely affected by a third-party vendor who operates in a poorly controlled manner or fails to deliver contracted services, which could lower revenues, increase costs, reduce profits, disrupt business, or damage the Company’s reputation.\n9\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nFinancial and Strategic Risks\nOur investments are subject to market and credit risks. Significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses.\nOur invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values.\nOur investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed income investments, where we are exposed to the risk that individual issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments. A concentration of these investments in any particular issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic areas could increase this risk. Factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels (consisting of both treasury rate and credit spread), financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control.\nAdditionally, as the majority of our investments are long-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, a significant increase in interest rates and/or credit spreads could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. These declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. Significant unrealized losses could substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity. It is possible our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses could experience a credit event where an allowance for credit loss is recorded, reducing net income.\nWe cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all. Significant downgrades or defaults of issuers could negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios, leading to potential downgrades of the Company by rating agencies, potential reduction in future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries, and/or higher financing costs at Globe Life Inc. (Parent Company) should additional statutory capital be required.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively affect income\n.\nDeclines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate policy liabilities, which could have a negative impact on income. Significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. Any such calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower interest rates.\nAn increase in interest rates could result in certain policyholders surrendering their life or annuity policies for cash, thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate invested assets if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations. In such a case, realized losses could result from the sale of the invested assets and could adversely affect our statutory income, required capital levels, and results of operations.\nOur ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on available funds from our insurance subsidiaries.\nAs a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. Moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us.\nThe principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. For example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. Additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on\n10\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nregulations by their states of domicile. Accordingly, impairments in assets or disruptions in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduce their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow the payment of dividends, a principal source of our cash flow, to us.\nOther sources of liquidity include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), intercompany financing and reinsurance.\nChanges in laws or regulations in the states in which our companies are domiciled could constrain the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to pay our debt obligations, corporate expenses, or dividends on our capital stock.\nWe are subject to liquidity risks associated with sourcing a concentration of our funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”).\nWe use institutional funding agreements originating from FHLB, which from time to time serve as a significant source of our liquidity. Additionally, we use agreements with the FHLB to meet near-term liquidity needs. If the FHLB were to change its definition of eligible collateral, we could be required to post additional amounts of collateral in the form of cash or other assets. Additionally, if our creditworthiness falls below the FHLB’s requirements or if legislative or other political actions cause changes to the FHLB’s mandate or to the eligibility of life insurance companies to be members of the FHLB system, we could be required to find other sources to replace this funding, which may prove difficult and increase our liquidity risk.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital.\nShould interest rates increase in the future, the higher interest expense on any newly issued debt may reduce net income. In addition, if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. Such market conditions could limit our ability to replace maturing debt obligations in a timely manner, or at all, and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business and maintain required capital levels and credit ratings.\nIn the event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. The availability and cost of additional financing or capital depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity. Additionally, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. Our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we would prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. If so, our results of operations, financial condition, consolidated RBC, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected.\nIndustry Risks\nVariations in actual-to-expected rates of mortality, morbidity and policyholder behavior could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe establish policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits. These reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models and accounting requirements that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. The reserve assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels or trends of mortality, morbidity, lapses, and discount rates. Changes in assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, actual results may differ significantly from the levels assumed, which could result in increased policy obligations and expenses and thus negatively affect our profit margins and income.\n11\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nA ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nVarious rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations. These ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. A downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us by limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and reducing our sales by adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through independent insurance agencies.\nObtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain supplemental health insurance policies is critical.\nA significant percentage of the supplemental health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from Medicare Supplement insurance. Medicare Supplement insurance, including conditions under which the premiums for such policies may be increased, is highly regulated at both the state and federal level. As a result, Medicare Supplement business is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. Since Medicare Supplement policies are coordinated with the federal Medicare program, which commonly experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the Medicare Supplement policies are typically necessary. Accordingly, the inability to obtain approval of appropriate premium rate increases for supplemental health insurance plans in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events that could adversely affect our financial condition or operations.\nOur insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the United States in relatively low-face amounts. Accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. However, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a pandemic or other public health issues, hurricane, earthquake, or man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or war, which may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. In addition, government, business and consumer reactions to public health events could result in material negative impacts to our business and operations.\nOur life and health insurance products are particularly exposed to risks of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other events that result in a large number of deaths. In addition, the occurrence of such an event in a concentrated geographic area could have a severe disruptive effect on our workforce and business operations. The likelihood and severity of such events cannot be predicted and are difficult to estimate. In such an event, the impact to our operations could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those problems affect our producing agents or our employees performing operational tasks and supporting computer-based data processing, or impair or destroy our capability to transmit, store, and retrieve valuable data. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our management were unavailable following a disaster, the achievement of our strategic objectives could be negatively impacted.\nWe are exposed to model risk, which is the risk of financial loss or reputational damage or adverse regulatory impacts caused by model errors or limitations, incorrect implementation of models, or misuse of or overreliance upon models.\nModels are utilized by our businesses and corporate areas primarily to project future cash flows associated with pricing products, calculating reserves and valuing assets, as well as in evaluating risk and determining capital requirements, among other uses. These models may not operate properly and may rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. As our businesses continue to grow and evolve, the number and complexity of models we utilize expands, increasing our exposure to error in the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated input data and assumptions.\n12\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nOur business is subject to the risk of direct or indirect effects of climate change.\nClimate change may increase the frequency and severity of weather-related events and natural disasters, which may adversely impact our mortality and morbidity rates and disrupt our business operations. In addition, climate change and climate change regulation may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities we hold, or our willingness to continue to hold their securities. Climate change may also influence investor sentiment with respect to the Company and investments in our portfolio.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\nOur businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth.\nInsurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they conduct business. The primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of policyholders, not investors. Regulatory agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates for our life, Medicare Supplement and other supplement health products, as well as other terms and conditions included in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, agent licensing, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves and permitted investments. Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses or approvals. The insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting our companies may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. Should regulatory changes occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of such laws and regulations. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend some or all of our business activities and/or impose substantial fines.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may affect our financial statements, reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP and accounting practices as promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ statutory accounting practices (NAIC SAP), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. Future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements. These changes, including underlying assumptions, projections, estimates or judgments/interpretations by management, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. (Refer to\nunder the caption\n)\nNon-compliance with laws or regulations related to customer and consumer privacy and information security, including a failure to ensure that our business associates with access to sensitive customer and consumer information maintain its confidentiality, could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations.\nThe collection, maintenance, use, disclosure, and disposal of personally identifiable information by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal, and state levels. Applicable laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. We are subject to the privacy and security provisions of federal laws including, but not limited to, the Gramm-Leach-Biley Act of 1999 (GLBA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA additionally requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates. Various state laws also address the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, to the extent they are more restrictive than these and other federal laws. Further, approximately half of the states have adopted a form of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ data security model law, which imposes security requirements. Noncompliance with these laws, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations and could result in material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business, and injunctive relief.\n13\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the Company could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the internet, third-party service providers, and information systems to operate in an efficient and resilient manner. We gather and maintain data for the purpose of conducting marketing, actuarial analysis, sales, and policy administration functions.\nMalicious third parties, employee or agent errors or disasters affecting our information systems could impair our business operations, regulatory compliance, and financial condition. Employee or agent malfeasance or errors in the handling of our information systems may result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information, or an inability to use our information systems to efficiently support business operations.\nAs a result of more frequent and sophisticated cyberattacks and the highly regulated nature of the insurance industry, we must continually implement new, and maintain existing, technology or adapt existing technology to protect against security and privacy incidents and to meet compliance requirements of new and proposed regulations. Our ability to modernize and maintain our information technology systems and infrastructure requires us to commit significant resources and effective planning and execution.\nAny incident affecting confidential information systems resulting from the above factors could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter potential customers from purchasing our products, result in the loss of existing customers, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, constrain cash flows, or require us to incur significant technical, legal, or other expenses. In addition, should we be unable to implement or maintain our technology effectively, efficiently, or in a timely manner, it could result in poor customer experience, poor agent experience, additional expenses, reputational harm, legal and regulatory actions, and other adverse consequences. This could also result in the inability to effectively support business operations.\nChanges in U.S. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs or negatively impact our insurance subsidiaries' capital.\nChanges to the Internal Revenue Code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products insurers offer, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries' capital, or limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to sell certain of their products.\nDamage to the brand and reputation of Globe Life or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business.\nNegative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media and other public forums could damage our brand or reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products and the persistency of in-force policies.\nWe may fail to meet expectations relating to corporate responsibility and sustainability standards and practices\n.\nCertain existing or potential investors, customers and regulators evaluate our business or other practices according to a variety of corporate responsibility and sustainability standards and expectations. Certain of our regulators have proposed or adopted, or may propose or adopt, certain corporate responsibility and sustainability rules or standards that would apply to our business. Our practices may be judged by these standards that are continually evolving and not always clear. Our decisions or priorities are made with the considerations of all stakeholders.

    "text": "Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have implemented a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) process to identify, assess and manage risks related to our overall organization, including material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our ERM process takes a holistic view of our specific risks and our strategy to anticipate and manage possible risks. Our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) oversees our ERM program and execution of our risk strategy, including as it relates to cyber risk. The Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\"), who reports to the CRO, leads our cyber risk management and strategy and the Information Security Department.\nOur cyber risk management and information security strategy includes elements to identify threats, assess risks, implement protective controls, detect attempts from threat actors to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems, respond to those events and ultimately recover from incidents. We use a threat-based approach to identify and assess cyber risks. This approach includes membership in threat intelligence organizations such as the FS-ISAC (Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center) to identify standard and emerging cyber-threats to financial services organizations and specifically to insurance companies. We also monitor for threats through vendor alerts, manufacturer bulletins, and government advisories.\nIdentified threats are analyzed using a recognized risk assessment model to consistently assess the likelihood and impact of these threats. We then map these threats to a well-established industry model called MITRE ATT&CK to identify areas of vulnerability. This analysis produces a likelihood score that is used in conjunction with an impact analysis to calculate the preliminary level of risk. The impact analysis includes factors such as disruption to business operations, employee and customer data, legal issues, reputational harm, and regulatory compliance. Based on the preliminary level of risk, we also analyze compensating controls and other factors to arrive at a residual risk level. If appropriate, additional mitigations may be planned based on this risk level.\nWe manage identified cyber risks by designing and implementing information security policies and controls addressing a wide range of current cyber threats. These policies and associated standards are designed to comply with current applicable legal and regulatory requirements and align with recognized frameworks for cybersecurity risk management. We review and update these policies and controls regularly in order to confirm ongoing alignment with the constantly changing threat landscape and evolving compliance requirements.\nWe assess the effectiveness of our policies and controls internally as well as through the engagement of third parties to conduct regular reviews, penetration tests, and vulnerability scans of information systems and applications. Results from these assessments help inform updates to risk assessments, changes to security controls and processes, and updates to policies and standards as appropriate. We employ a variety of measures to detect, prevent, and reduce the frequency and severity of cybersecurity incidents, which may include, but are not limited to, the use of encryption, intrusion prevention, endpoint security, password protection, multi-factor authentication, internal phishing testing and security awareness training, and vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.\nIn addition, we have implemented a third-party risk management program to assess our vendors’ ability to adequately protect information, which includes requiring agreements with our vendors that address cybersecurity. We periodically review and assess certain third parties’ adherence to these agreements and review for information security (including cybersecurity) incidents experienced by our third-party vendors.\nDue to the type and volume of information that we collect and store to provide insurance coverage to prospective and current policyholders, we are an attractive target for cyber threat actors seeking financial gain. Our failure to maintain the safety of our policyholder’s information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. To date, we have not experienced a cybersecurity incident that resulted in a material adverse effect on our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition; however, there can be no guarantee that we will not experience such an incident in the future. Although we maintain cybersecurity insurance, the costs and expenses related to cybersecurity incidents may not be fully insured. We describe whether\n15\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nand how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition under\n, General Risk Factors, \"The failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the Company could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\"\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors considers information security to be an enterprise-wide risk management issue and oversees material cybersecurity risks through the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is designated with the responsibility to monitor and periodically report to the full Board regarding management’s risk management and information security processes. The ERM Committee and the Operational Risk Committee (“ORC”) are the senior management-level entities designated with the responsibility to oversee the execution of our risk strategy, including as it relates to cyber risk. These Committees are composed of an enterprise-wide representative group of the Company’s Executive and Senior Vice Presidents, as well as other essential directors and personnel. The ERM Committee is chaired by our CRO, and the ORC is chaired by our Chief Security Officer (“CSO”). The Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) and CISO serve on both Committees. Our CRO has over a decade of experience managing risks at the Company, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Our current CIO has over 15 years of experience managing risks, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Our current CSO has a Certified Information Systems Security Professional certification, a Certified Information Systems Auditor certification, a Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control certification, and over 20 years of experience in cybersecurity. The CISO serves on both Committees and leads cyber governance and strategy, as well as cyber risk and incident management. The current CISO holds a master's degree in cybersecurity, has a Certified Information Systems Security Professional certification, and has over a decade of experience in cybersecurity.\nThe CISO assesses cyber risk and provides recommendations for management decision(s) by the ORC on a routine basis. The CISO briefs the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. These updates include compliance with applicable regulations as well as current or planned changes to the regulations, an overview of the current cyber threats, risk management activities, and discussions of cyber incident investigations that warrant the attention of the Board. The CISO also provides an annual update to the entire Board of Directors on changes in cybersecurity, top threats facing the Company, key risks and mitigation efforts, and any potential material cybersecurity incidents. The Chair of the Audit Committee also provides a quarterly report to the Board on any information security topics presented to the Audit Committee by management.\nIncident Management\nThe Company maintains and tests a cybersecurity incident response plan that outlines steps for the containment, investigation of, response to and recovery from cyber events. The plan also includes information pertaining to roles and responsibilities, escalation, third party support, documentation, reporting, and law enforcement engagement. Escalation is designed to raise awareness of events that may require disclosure to help ensure assessments are performed without unreasonable delay. In alignment with our plan, we maintain playbooks that outline processes for responding to certain incidents commonly observed in the insurance industry. In addition, we have implemented a formal crisis management process, which outlines an incident response communication plan with executive leadership as well as criteria for communication with the chair of the Audit Committee and the Lead Director of the Board."

In 2022, net income decreased 13% from $1.03 billion in 2021. On a diluted per common share basis, net income per common share for 2023 increased from $9.04 to $10.07. In 2022, net income per common share, on a diluted per common share basis, decreased to $9.04 from $9.99.\nNet operating income increased 7% to $1.03 billion in 2023, compared with $961 million in 2022. In 2022, net operating income decreased 3% from $994 million in 2021. On a diluted per common share basis, net operating income per common share for 2023 increased from $9.71 to $10.65, an increase of 10%. In 2022, net income per common share, on a diluted per common share basis, increased 1% from $9.63. Net operating income is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and as such is considered a non-GAAP measure. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. Additionally, net income in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was affected by certain significant and unusual non-operating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. We remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such items from our segment analysis for current periods.\nThe liability for future policy benefits is determined each reporting period based on the net level premium method. Net level premiums reflect a recomputed net premium ratio using actual experience since the issue date, and expected future experience based on future cash-flow assumptions. See\nfor additional information. The policy liability is accrued as premium revenue is recognized and adjusted for differences between actual and expected experience in the form of remeasurement gains and losses during the period.\nThe Company continues to see positive signs in its core operations, including strong sales and premium growth, favorable persistency, and a strong ROE, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income.\n23\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nGlobe Life's operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth below. Net operating income has been used consistently by management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from GAAP net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized gains and losses and other significant and unusual items included in net income. Management believes an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company’s business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nAnalysis of Profitability by Segment\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nThe results for each of the years presented above are impacted, as previously noted, by the reserve development and assumption changes in the third quarter of 2023, 2022, and 2021. The life insurance segment is our primary segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented. In 2023, the life insurance segment underwriting margin increased $63 million compared with 2022, primarily a result of increased premiums, favorable policy obligations as a percent of premium, and a lower remeasurement loss in 2023 resulting from the assumption updates. In 2022, the life insurance segment underwriting margin decreased $32 million when compared with 2021, which was a result of a higher remeasurement loss resulting from assumption updates in 2022 than in 2021, offset by increased premiums.\n24\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nIn 2023, the largest contributor of total underwriting margin was the life insurance segment and the primary distribution channel was the American Income Life Division. The following charts represent the breakdown of total underwriting margin by operating segment and distribution channel for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nTotal premium income rose 3% for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $4.46 billion. Total net sales increased 6% to $768 million, when compared with 2022. Total first-year collected premium (defined in the following section) increased 5% to $605 million for 2023 compared to $577 million in 2022.\nLife insurance premium income increased 4% to $3.14 billion over the prior-year total of $3.03 billion. Life net sales rose 3% to $544 million for the year ended 2023. First-year collected life premium increased 3% to $420 million. Life underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, increased to 38% in 2023 from 37%. Underwriting margin increased to $1.19 billion in 2023, compared to $1.13 billion for the same period in 2022.\nHealth insurance premium income increased 3% to $1.32 billion over the prior-year total of $1.28 billion. Health net sales rose 17% to $224 million for the year ended 2023. First-year collected health premium rose 10% to $185 million. Health underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 29% in 2023 and 2022. Health underwriting margin decreased slightly to $378 million for the year ended 2023, compared to the same period in 2022.\nExcess investment income, the measure of profitability of our investment segment, increased 25% during the year ended 2023 to $130.4 million from $104.6 million in the same period in 2022. Excess investment income per common share, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program and increased net investment income, increased 27% to $1.35 from $1.06 when compared with the same period in 2022.\nInsurance administrative expenses increased 1% in 2023 when compared with the prior-year period. These expenses were 6.8% as a percent of premium during 2023 compared to 6.9% in 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 3.4 million Globe Life Inc. shares at a total cost of $380 million for an average share price of $112.84.\nThe discussions of our segments are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in\n.\nWe use three measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: “annualized premium in force,” “net sales,” and “first-year collected premium.”\n25\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\n•\nAnnualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period.\n•\nNet sales are calculated as annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Direct to Consumer, where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. Management considers net sales to be a better indicator of the rate of premium growth than annualized premium issued.\n•\nFirst-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.\nSee further discussion of the distribution channels below for\nand\n.\n26\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nLIFE INSURANCE\nLife insurance is the Company's predominant segment. During 2023, life premium represented 70% of total premium and life underwriting margin represented 75% of the total underwriting margin. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.\nThe following table presents the summary of results of life insurance.\nFurther discussion of the results by distribution channel is included below.\nLife Insurance\nSummary of Results\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNet policy obligations amounted to 41% of premiums for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 43% in the year-ago period and 41% for 2021.\nThe table below summarizes life underwriting margin by distribution channel for the last three years.\nLife Insurance\nUnderwriting Margin by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n27\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nLife insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. Premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years is as follows:\nLife Insurance\nPremium by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nAnnualized life premium in force was $3.2 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 4% over $3.1 billion a year earlier.\nThe following table presents net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution channel.\nLife Insurance\nNet Sales by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nThe table below discloses first-year collected life premium by distribution channel.\nLife Insurance\nFirst-Year Collected Premium by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nA discussion of life operations by distribution channel follows.\nThe\nAmerican Income Life Division\nmarkets to members of labor unions and other affinity groups, and continues to diversify its lead sources by utilizing third-party internet vendor leads and obtaining referrals to facilitate sustainable growth. This division is Globe Life's largest contributor of life premium of any distribution channel at 51% of the Company's 2023 total life premium. Net sales were $323 million in 2023, up from $317 million in 2022. The\n28\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nunderwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 45% for the year ended December 31, 2023, down from 46% in the prior year due to higher acquisition costs.\nBelow is the average producing agent count at the end of the indicated periods for the American Income Life Division. The average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the beginning and end of each week during the year. The average producing agent count increased 12% over the year-ago period. The increase in average producing agent count was driven by an increase in new agent recruiting. Sales growth in this division, as well as within our other exclusive agencies, is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force.\nAmerican Income Life continues to focus on growing and strengthening the agency force, specifically through emphasis on agency middle-management growth and additional agency office openings. In addition to offering financial incentives and training opportunities, the agency has made considerable investments in information technology, including a customer relationship management (CRM) tool for the agency force. This tool is designed to drive productivity in lead distribution, conservation of business, manager dashboards, and new agent recruiting. Additionally, this division has invested in and successfully implemented technology that allows the agency force to engage in virtual recruiting, training, and sales activity. The agents have shifted to primarily a virtual experience with the customers and have generated a vast majority of sales through virtual presentations. We find this flexibility to be attractive to new recruits as well as a driver of sustainability for our agency force.\nThe\nDirect to Consumer Division\n(DTC) offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of marketing approaches, including direct mailings, insert media, and electronic media. In recent years, production from electronic media, which is comprised of sales through both the internet and inbound phone calls to our call center, has grown faster than direct mail response as customer preferences have focused marketing activity to internet and mobile technology. The proportion of sales from the internet and inbound phone calls continue to outpace the activity from the direct mailings, but all three channels continue to work in an omnichannel approach. The different media channels support and complement one another in the division's efforts to reach the consumer. The DTC's long-term growth has been fueled by constant innovation and name recognition. We continually introduce new initiatives in this division in an attempt to increase response rates and create a seamless customer experience.\nThe juvenile market is an important source of sales, it is also a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders, who are more likely to respond favorably to a DTC solicitation for life coverage on themselves in comparison to the general adult population. Also, future offerings to juvenile policyholders and their parents are sources of lower acquisition-cost life insurance sales in the future.\nDTC net sales declined 8% to $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with $126 million in the prior year. This decline is due primarily to reductions in direct mail and mailing insert marketing activity resulting from the impact of inflation on postage and paper costs. While total sales have declined, the focus has been on improving profitability and improving the underwriting margin. DTC’s underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 24% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 22% for the same period in 2022, and 2% below the 26% underwriting margin percentage for 2021.\nThe\nLiberty National Division\nmarkets individual life insurance to middle-income household and worksite customers. Recent investments in new sales technologies as well as recent growth in middle management within the agency are expected to help continue this growth. The underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 33%, up from 31% for the year ended 2022, but down slightly from 34% for 2021. The increase from the prior year is primarily attributable to\nincreased premiums, and lower policy obligations as a percent of premium,\nduring the year compared with the same period a year ago. The decrease in 2022 from 2021 is due primarily to higher acquisition costs.\nNet sales rose 22% in 2023 over the same period in 2022. With the division's ability to return to face-to-face customer interaction and the option of virtual sales, the Company continues to project total life net sales to increase in 2024 as compared to the prior year.\n29\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nBelow is the average producing agent count at the end of the indicated periods for Liberty National Division.\nThe Liberty National Division average producing agent count increased significantly compared with the prior year. We continue to execute our long-term plan to grow this agency through expansion from small-town markets in the Southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers. Continued expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated, less-penetrated areas will help create long-term agency growth. In addition to the aforementioned geographic expansion, we have also started a campaign of market expansion to increase our agency presence in cities where we currently have offices, but not enough to properly serve the community, region, area and city. These tend to be larger geographic cities which will help create long-term sustainable agency growth. Additionally, the agency continues to help improve the ability of agents to develop new worksite marketing business. Systems that have been put in place, including the addition of a CRM platform and enhanced analytical capabilities, have helped the agents develop additional worksite marketing opportunities as well as improve the productivity of agents selling in the individual life market. As the division continues to gain momentum in its sales and recruiting initiatives, as well as advances its technology and CRM platform, the agency anticipates continued growth in recruiting activity and average producing agent count.\nThe\nOther Agencies\ndistribution channels primarily include non-exclusive independent agencies selling primarily life insurance. The other distribution channels contributed $207 million of life premium income, or 7% of Globe Life's total life premium income in 2023, and contrib\nuted 2% of net sales for the year.\nHEALTH INSURANCE\nHealth insurance sold by the Company primarily includes Medicare Supplement insurance, accident coverage, and other limited-benefit supplemental health products including accident, cancer, critical illness, heart, and intensive care products.\nHealth premium accounted for 30% of our total premium in 2023, while the health underwriting margin accounted for 24% of total underwriting margin. Health underwriting margin increased slightly to $378 million compared to $377 million in the prior year. The Company continues to emphasize life insurance sales relative to health due to life’s superior long-term profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income.\nThe following table presents underwriting margin data for health insurance.\nHealth Insurance\nSummary of Results\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n30\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nHealth premium increased 3% in 2023 to $1.32 billion when compared to 2022. In 2022, health premium rose 7% to $1.28 billion when compared to 2021. Health underwriting margin increased slightly from $377 million in 2022 to $378 million in 2023 and increased 7% from $352 million in 2021 to $377 million in 2022 primarily due to growth in premiums.\nThe table below summarizes health underwriting margin by distribution channel for the last three years.\nHealth Insurance\nUnderwriting Margin by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nGlobe Life markets supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels. The following table is an analysis of our health premium by distribution channel for each of the last three years.\nHealth Insurance\nPremium by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nPremium related to limited-benefit supplemental health products comprise $743 million, or 56%, of the total health premiums for 2023 compared with $702 million, or 55%, in 2022 and $639 million, or 53%, in 2021. Premium from Medicare Supplement products comprises the remaining $576 million, or 44%, for 2023 compared with $580 million, or 45%, in 2022 and $562 million, or 47%, in 2021.\nAnnualized health premium in force was $1.39 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 4% from $1.33 billion in 2022.\n31\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nPresented below is a table of health net sales by distribution channel for the last three years.\nHealth Insurance\nNet Sales by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nHealth net sales related to supplemental health products comprise $161 million, or 72%, of the total health new sales for 2023 compared with $137 million, or 71%, in 2022. Medicare Supplement sales make up the remaining $63 million, or 28%, for 2023 compared with $54 million, or 29%, in 2022.\nThe following table discloses first-year collected health premium by distribution channel.\nHealth Insurance\nFirst-Year Collected Premium by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nFirst-year collected premium related to limited-benefit plans comprise $133 million, or 72% of total first-year collected premium for 2023 compared with $108 million, or 64%, in 2022. First-year collected premium from Medicare Supplement policies make up the remaining $52 million, or 28%, for 2023 compared with $60 million, or 36%, in 2022.\nA discussion of health operations by distribution channel follows.\nThe\nUnited American Division\nconsists of non-exclusive independent agencies who may also sell for other companies. The United American Division was Globe Life's largest health agency in terms of health premium income, with sales up 23% from the same period in the prior year.\nThis division includes three different units:\n•\nUA General Agency, which primarily sells individual Medicare Supplement insurance through independent agents;\n•\nSpecial Markets, which markets retiree health insurance to employer and union groups through brokers; and\n•\nGlobe Life Benefits, which offers group worksite supplemental health insurance through brokers.\n32\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nThe majority of the premium revenue comes from Medicare Supplement and Retiree Health business. Underwriting margin as a percent of premium for the division was 11% in 2023, 12% in 2022, and 11% in 2021.\nThe\nFamily Heritage Division\nprimarily markets limited-benefit supplemental health insurance in non-urban areas. Most of its policies include a cash-back feature, such as a return of premium, where any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy. Underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 34% in 2023, the same as in 2022, and 31% in 2021.\nThe division experienced a 16% rise in health net sales in 2023 as compared with the 2022, primarily due to an increase in recruiting, as well as improved agent productivity and training. The division will continue to implement incentive and retention programs to further these increases in the number of producing agents.\nBelow is the average producing agent count at the end of the indicated periods for the Family Heritage Division. The average producing agent count was up 10% compared with the same period a year ago, driven by an increase in recruiting during 2023.\nThe\nLiberty National Division\nrepresented 14% of all Globe Life health premium income at $188 million in 2023. The Liberty National Division markets limited-benefit supplemental health products, consisting primarily of cancer and critical illness insurance. Much of Liberty National’s health business is generated through worksite marketing targeting small businesses. In 2023, health premium income was flat. Liberty National's first-year collected premium increased 14% to $26 million in 2023 compared with $22 million in 2022. Health net sales for 2023 increased by $4 million or 15% from 2022.\nThe Company's other distribution channels, while primarily focused on selling life insurance, also market health products. The American Income Life Division primarily markets accident plans. The Direct to Consumer Division primarily markets Medicare Supplements to employer or union-sponsored groups. On a combined basis, these other channels accounted for 14% of health premium in 2023 and 2022.\nANNUITIES\nOur fixed annuity balances at the end of 2023 and 2022 were $773.0 million and $954.3 million, respectively. Underwriting margin was $8.5 million for 2023, $10.5 million for 2022, and $9.8 million for 2021.\nWe do not currently market stand-alone fixed or deferred annuity products, favoring instead protection-oriented life and supplemental health insurance products. Therefore, we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward.\nINVESTMENTS\nWe manage our capital resources, including investments and cash flow, through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in\n. It is defined as net investment income less the required interest attributable to policy liabilities.\nManagement also views excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. As excess investment income per diluted common share\n33\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nincorporates all invested assets and insurance liabilities, we view excess investment income per diluted common share as a useful measure to evaluate the investment segment.\nExcess Investment Income\n.\nThe following table summarizes Globe Life's investment income, excess investment income, and excess investment income per diluted common share.\nAnalysis of Excess Investment Income\n(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)\n(1)\nInterest on policy liabilities is a component of total policyholder benefits, a GAAP measure. The amounts presented for 2021 and 2022 have been retrospectively adjusted to exclude the interest on deferred acquisition costs due to the LDTI standard and the interest on debt.\nExcess investment income\nincreased $26 million, or 25%, in 2023 when compared with 2022. In 2022, excess investment income increased $8 million, or 8%, when compared with 2021. Excess investment income per diluted common share was $1.35 during 2023, an increase of 27% over the prior-year period ended 2022. Excess investment income per diluted common share was $1.06 during 2022, an increase of 13% over the period ended 2021. Excess investment income per diluted common share generally increases at a faster pace than excess investment income because the number of diluted shares outstanding generally decreases from year to year as a result of our share repurchase program.\nNet investment income\nincreased at a compound annual growth rate of 4% over the three years ending 2023 and mean invested assets increased at a compound annual growth rate of 4% during the same period. The effective annual yield rate earned on the fixed maturity portfolio was 5.20% in 2023. Generally, investment income grows at a slower rate than the assets when the yield on new investments is lower than the yield on dispositions or the average portfolio yield. It also increases at a faster rate than the assets when new investment yields exceed the yield on dispositions or the average portfolio yield. Investment income grew in the current period due to the growth in invested assets and the increase in interest rates compared to the prior year. We currently expect that the average annual turnover rate of fixed maturity assets will be less than 1% per annum over the next five years and will not have a material impact on net investment income. In addition to fixed maturities, the Company has also invested in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships with debt-like characteristics that diversify risk and enhance risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns on the portfolio. The earned yield on the investment funds for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 6.95%. See additional information in\n. The following chart presents the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets.\nGlobe Life's net investment income benefits from higher interest rates on new investments. While increasing interest rates have resulted in a net unrealized loss from our available for sale debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2023, we are not concerned because we do not generally intend to sell, nor is it likely that we will be required to sell, the fixed maturities prior to their anticipated recovery.\nRequired interest on insurance policy liabilities\nreduces excess investment income, as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” required interest on insurance policy liabilities.\n34\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nAs such, it is reclassified from the insurance segment to the investment segment. As discussed in\n,\nmanagement regards this as a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments. Required interest is based on the original discount rate assumptions for our insurance policies in force.\nThe great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current GAAP accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products which mandate that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business. Each calendar year, we set the original discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability for all insurance policies issued that year. The liability reported on the balance sheet is updated in subsequent periods using current discount rates as of the end of the relevant reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Other Comprehensive Income. The rates are based on the methodology prescribed in ASU 2018-12. See\nfor additional information.\nThe discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in-force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in for purposes of recognizing income. As such, the overall original discount rate for the entire in-force block of 5.5% is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. Changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves on the entire block of in force business. Business issued in the current year has little impact on the overall weighted-average original discount rate due to the size of our in-force business.\nInformation about interest on policy liabilities is shown in the following table.\nRequired Interest on Insurance Policy Liabilities\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n(1)\nReflects the average discount rate applicable to the current period, which is used to accrue interest on the insurance policy liabilities for each of the years presented.\nRealized Gains and Losses.\nOur life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. Since benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to\n35\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nprovide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support these obligations. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.\nDespite our intent to hold fixed maturity investments for a long period of time, investments are occasionally sold, exchanged, called, or experience a credit loss event, resulting in a realized gain or loss. Gains or losses are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders. In a bond exchange offer, bondholders may consent to exchange their existing bonds for another class of debt securities. The Company also has investments in certain limited partnerships, held under the fair value option, with fair value changes recognized in\nRealized gains (losses)\nin the\n.\nRealized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period-to-period trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.\nThe following table summarizes our tax-effected realized gains (losses) by component for each of the three years ended December 31, 2023.\nAnalysis of Realized Gains (Losses), Net of Tax\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per share data)\n(1)\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company recorded $50.9 million, $147.6 million, and $109.2 million, respectively, of exchanges of fixed maturity securities (noncash transactions) that resulted in $(1.5) million, $1.5 million, and $19.9 million, respectively, in realized gains (losses), net of tax.\n(2)\nOther realized gains (losses) are primarily a result of changes in the fair value for assets held in rabbi trust.\nIn 2023, it was announced Signature Bank New York and First Republic Bank had entered receivership. The Company disposed of each of the holdings and incurred a $52 million after-tax realized loss during the year ended December 31, 2023. As investment yields increased throughout 2022 and 2023, the Company disposed of certain fixed maturity investments to improve the risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns on the portfolio and enhance the yield, credit quality, or diversification of the portfolio.\nInvestment Acquisitions\n.\nGlobe Life's investment policy calls for investing primarily in investment grade fixed maturities that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally invest in securities with longer-term maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our life and health policy liabilities. We believe this\n36\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nstrategy is appropriate since our expected future cash flows are generally stable and predictable and the likelihood that we will need to sell invested assets to raise cash is low.\nThe following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity investments. The effective annual yield shown is based on the acquisition price and call features, if any, of the securities. For non-callable bonds, the yield is calculated to maturity date. For callable bonds acquired at a premium, the yield is calculated to the earliest known call date and call price after acquisition (\"first call date\"). For all other callable bonds, the yield is calculated to maturity date.\nFixed Maturity Acquisitions Selected Information\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n(1)\nFixed maturity acquisitions included unsettled trades of $4 million in 2023, $0 in 2022 and $7 million in 2021.\n(2)\nTax-equivalent basis, where the yield on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities.\nFor investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment. Absent sales and \"make-whole calls,\" however, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.\nDuring 2023 and 2022, acquisitions consisted primarily of corporate and municipal bonds with securities spanning a diversified range of issuers, industry sectors, and geographical regions. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we invested primarily in the municipal, financial, and industrial sectors. For the entire portfolio, the taxable equivalent effective yield earned was 5.20%, up approximately 3 basis points from the yield in 2022. Further, as previously noted in the discussion of net investment income, the increase in taxable equivalent effective yield was primarily due to new purchase yields exceeding the yield on dispositions and the average portfolio yield. In addition to the fixed maturity acquisitions, Globe Life invested $159 million and  $77 million in commercial mortgage loans and $156 million and $213 million in other long-term investments in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other long-term investments primarily consist of investment funds. See\nfor further discussion.\nNew cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations, cash received on existing investments, and proceeds from dispositions. Dispositions of fixed maturities were $853 million in 2023 and $852 million in 2022.\nSince fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio, the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities. See a breakdown of the Company's Other long-term investments in\n.\n37\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nSelected information concerning the fixed maturity portfolio is as follows:\nFixed Maturity Portfolio Selected Information\n(1)\nTax-equivalent basis. The yield on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities.\n(2)\nGlobe Life calculates the average life and duration of the fixed maturity portfolio two ways:\n(a) based on the next call date which is the next call date for callable bonds and the maturity date for noncallable bonds, and\n(b) based on the maturity date of all bonds, whether callable or not.\n(3)\nEffective duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of a fixed-income security to a 1% change in interest rates.\n38\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nCredit Risk Sensitivity\n.\nThe following tables summarize certain information about the major corporate sectors and security types held in our fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFixed Maturities by Sector\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n39\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nFixed Maturities by Sector\nDecember 31, 2022\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n40\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nCorporate securities, which consist of bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, were the largest component of the fixed maturity portfolio as of December 31, 2023, representing 80% of amortized cost, net, and 81% of fair value. The remainder of the portfolio is invested primarily in securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. municipalities. The Company holds insignificant amounts in foreign government bonds, collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities, and mortgage-backed securities. Corporate securities are diversified over a variety of industry sectors and issuers. At December 31, 2023, the total fixed maturity portfolio consisted of 980 issuers.\nFixed maturities had a fair value of $17.9 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with $16.5 billion at December 31, 2022. The net unrealized loss position in the fixed-maturity portfolio decreased from $1.8 billion at December 31, 2022 to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in market rates during the period.\nFor more information about our fixed maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, including a discussion of allowance for credit losses, an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities, see\n.\nAn analysis of the fixed maturity portfolio by composite quality rating at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, is shown in the following tables. The composite rating for each security, other than private-placement securities managed by third parties, is the average of the security’s available ratings as assigned by Moody’s Investor Service, Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, LTD. The ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average. The composite quality rating is created utilizing a methodology developed by Globe Life using ratings from the various rating agencies noted above. The composite quality rating is not a Standard & Poor's credit rating. Standard & Poor's does not sponsor, endorse, or promote the composite quality rating and shall not be liable for any use of the composite quality rating. Included in the following chart are private placement fixed maturity holdings of $439 million at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses ($402 million at fair value) for which the ratings were assigned by the third-party managers.\nFixed Maturities by Rating\nAt December 31, 2023\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n41\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nFixed Maturities by Rating\nAt December 31, 2022\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nThe overall quality rating of the portfolio is A-, the same as of year-end 2022. Fixed maturities rated BBB are 48% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2023, down from 51% at December 31, 2022. While this ratio is high relative to our peers, it is at its lowest level in over 10 years and we have limited exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, and asset-backed securities. Additionally, the Company does not participate in securities lending and has no off-balance sheet investments as of December 31, 2023. Of our fixed maturity purchases, BBB securities generally provide the Company with the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns largely due to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nAn analysis of changes in our portfolio of below-investment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses is as follows:\nBelow-Investment Grade Fixed Maturities\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nOur investment policy calls for investing primarily in fixed maturities that are investment grade and meet our quality and yield objectives. Thus, any increases in below-investment grade issues are typically a result of ratings\n42\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\ndowngrades of existing holdings. Below-investment grade bonds at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, were 7% of our shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2023. Globe Life invests long term and as such, one of our key criterion in our investment process is to select issuers that have the ability to weather multiple financial cycles.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nOperating expenses are included in the \"Corporate and Other\" segment and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the Parent Company. Insurance administrative expenses generally include expenses incurred after a policy has been issued. As these expenses relate to premium for a given period, management measures the expenses as a percentage of premium income. The Company also views stock-based compensation expense as a Parent Company expense. Expenses associated with the issuance of our insurance policies are reflected as acquisition expenses and included in the determination of underwriting margin.\nThe following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2023.\nOperating Expenses Selected Information\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nTotal operating expenses for December 31, 2023 decreased in comparison with the prior year primarily due to decreases in stock compensation expense and other non-operating costs. Insurance administrative expenses increased $1.8 million primarily due to higher information technology costs, information security costs, and other administrative costs offset by a decline in pension-related employee benefit costs. Insurance administrative expenses as a percent of premium were 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 6.9% for the same period in 2022.\n43\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nSHARE REPURCHASES\nGlobe Life has an ongoing share repurchase program that began in 1986. The share repurchase program is reviewed with the Board of Directors by management quarterly, and continues indefinitely unless and until the Board of Directors decides to suspend, terminate or modify the program. With no specified authorization amount, management determines the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the excess cash flows after the payment of dividends to the Parent Company shareholders, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used $9.4 billion of excess cash flow at the Parent Company to repurchase Globe Life Inc. common shares after determining that the repurchases provide a greater risk-adjusted after-tax return than other investment alternatives.\nExcess cash flow at the Parent Company is primarily comprised of dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries less interest expense paid on its debt and other limited operating activities. The majority of our share repurchases are made from excess cash flow after the payment of shareholder dividends. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the resulting tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises.\nThe following table summarizes share repurchases for each of the last three years.\nAnalysis of Share Purchases\n(Amounts in thousands)\n(1)\nExcludes excise tax on the repurchase of treasury stock of $4 million in 2023, $0 in 2022, and $0 in 2021.\nThroughout the remainder of this discussion, share repurchases will only refer to those made from excess cash flow at the Parent Company.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity.\nLiquidity provides Globe Life with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required to support our business operations and meet our financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from multiple sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, a revolving credit facility, commercial paper, and the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nInsurance Subsidiary Liquidity\n.\nThe operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Cash inflows for the insurance subsidiaries primarily include premium and investment income. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are cash inflows. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. A portion of the excess cash inflows in the current year will provide for the payment of future policy benefits and are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities as they better match the long-term nature of these obligations. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restrictions. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. While the leading source of the excess cash is investment income, a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control. While the insurance subsidiaries annually generate more operating cash inflows than cash outflows, the companies also have the entire available-for-sale fixed maturity investment portfolio available to create additional cash flows if required.\nFour of our insurance subsidiaries are members of the FHLB of Dallas. FHLB membership provides the insurance subsidiaries with access to various low-cost collateralized borrowings and funding agreements. While not the only\n44\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nsource of liquidity, the FHLB could provide the insurance subsidiaries with an additional source of liquidity, if needed. Refer to\nfor further details.\nParent Company Liquidity.\nAn important source of Parent Company liquidity is the dividends from its insurance subsidiaries. These dividends are received throughout the year and are used by the Parent Company to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, interest and principal repayment requirements on Parent Company debt, and operating expenses of the Parent Company.\n(1)\nExcess cash flows are reported gross of shareholder dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, shareholder dividends were $84 million, $81 million, and $80 million, respectively.\nFor more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the\nsection of\n.\nAlthough these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the Parent Company.\nDividends from subsidiaries and excess cash flows are projected to be higher in 2024 than in 2023 primarily due to lower life obligations and the growth in our underwriting margins, both of which resulted in higher statutory earnings generated by the affiliates. Additional sources of liquidity for the Parent Company are cash, intercompany receivables, intercompany borrowings, public debt markets, term loans, and a revolving credit facility. See\nfor more information. The credit facility is discussed below.\nShort-Term Borrowings.\nAn additional source of Parent Company liquidity is a credit facility with a group of lenders allowing for unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $750 million, which could be extended up to $1 billion. While the Parent Company may request the extension, it is not guaranteed. Up to $250 million in letters of credit can be issued against the facility. The facility serves as a back-up line of credit for a commercial paper program under which commercial paper may be issued at any time, with total commercial paper outstanding not to exceed the facility maximum less any letters of credit issued. As of December 31, 2023, we had available $316 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility, compared with $340 million a year earlier. Interest charged on the commercial paper program resembles variable rate debt due to its short term nature. Globe Life has consistently been able to issue commercial paper as needed during the three years ended December 31, 2023. As discussed in\n, on September 30, 2021, Globe Life amended the credit agreement dated August 24, 2020. The five-year credit agreement will mature on September 30, 2026. As of December 31, 2023, the Parent Company was in full compliance with all covenants related to the aforementioned debt.\nAs a part of the credit facility, Globe Life has stand-by letters of credit. These letters are issued among our subsidiaries, one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer, and have no impact on company obligations as a whole. Any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of off-shore captive reinsurers might require Globe Life to obtain third-party financing, which could cause an insignificant increase in financing costs. On March 29, 2023, the letters of credit were amended to reduce the amount outstanding from $125 million to $115 million. The outstanding letters of credit remained at $115 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe Parent Company expects to have readily available funds for 2024 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of debt, an additional short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing. Refer to\nand the discussion surrounding the Company's obligations over the next five years.\n45\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nAs noted above, the Parent Company had access to $48 million of liquid assets available as of December 31, 2023. This liquidity is available to the Company in the event additional funds are needed to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance subsidiaries.\nConsolidated Liquidity.\nConsolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were $1.48 billion in 2023, compared with $1.42 billion in 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to fluctuations in the settlement of certain amounts included in other liabilities. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies received proceeds from dispositions of fixed maturities available for sale, mortgage loans, and other long-term investments in the amount of  $1.05 billion in 2023. As noted under the caption\n,\nthe Parent Company has in place a revolving credit facility. The insurance subsidiaries have no additional outstanding credit facilities.\nCash and short-term investments were $185 million at the end of 2023 compared with $207 million at the end of 2022. In addition to these liquid assets, $17.9 billion (fair value at December 31, 2023) of fixed income securities are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. Approximately $1.3 billion, at fair value, are pledged for outstanding FHLB advances and reinsurance. Further, approximately 97% of our fixed income securities are publicly traded, freely tradable under SEC Rule 144, or qualified for resale under SEC Rule 144A. While our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale, we have the ability and general intent to hold any securities to recovery or maturity. Our strong cash flows from operations, ongoing investment maturities, and available liquidity under credit facility make any need to sell securities for liquidity highly unlikely.\nCapital Resources.\nThe Parent Company's capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility and current maturities of long-term debt)\n,\nlong-term debt, and shareholders’ equity.\nDebt:\nThe carrying value of the long-term debt was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2023, and 2022. A complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in\n.\nFinancing costs for the corporate and other segment consist primarily of interest on our various debt instruments. The table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the\n.\nAnalysis of Financing Costs\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nIn 2023, financing costs increased 13% compared with prior year primarily due to higher short-term interest rates. More information on our debt transactions is disclosed in the\nsection of this report and in\n.\nSubsidiary Capital\n:\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has established a risk-based factor approach for determining threshold risk-based capital levels for all insurance companies. This approach was designed to assist the regulatory bodies in identifying companies that may require regulatory attention. A Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratio is typically determined by dividing adjusted total statutory capital by the amount of risk-based capital determined using the NAIC’s factors. If a company’s RBC ratio approaches two times the RBC amount, the company must file a plan with the NAIC for improving its capital levels (this level is commonly referred to as “Company Action Level” RBC). Companies typically hold a multiple of the Company Action Level RBC depending on their particular business needs and risk profile.\nOur goal is to maintain statutory capital within our insurance subsidiaries at levels necessary to support our current ratings. For 2024, Globe Life has targeted a consolidated Company Action Level RBC ratio of 300% to 320%. The Company has concluded that this capital level is more than adequate and sufficient to support its current ratings,\n46\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\ngiven the nature of its business and its risk profile. For 2023, our consolidated Company Action Level RBC ratio was 314%. The Parent Company is committed to maintaining the targeted consolidated RBC ratio at its insurance subsidiaries and has sufficient liquidity available to provide additional capital if necessary.\nShareholder's Equity\n:\nAs noted under the caption\nwithin this report, we have an ongoing share repurchase program.\nGlobe Life has continually increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years.\nIn 2023, new guidance became effective that impacted the accounting for our long duration contracts with significant effects to shareholders' equity. Please see\nfor additional information.\nShareholders’ equity was $4.5 billion at December 31, 2023. This compares to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2022, as adjusted, an increase of $537 million or 14%. Shareholders' equity increased $1.9 billion, or 97%, during 2022 from $2.0 billion in 2021.\nAt December 31, 2022, shareholders' equity was $3.9 billion. During 2023, shareholders’ equity increased as a result of net income of $971 million, but was offset by share repurchases of $380 million and an additional $127 million in share repurchases to offset the dilution from stock option exercises. Additionally, the balance of AOCI increased $18 million primarily due to increased interest rates and discount rates over the period. At December 31, 2021, shareholders' equity was $2.0 billion. During 2022, shareholders' equity increased as a result of net income of $894 million, but was offset by share repurchases of $335 million and an additional $120 million in share repurchases to offset the dilution from stock option exercises. Additionally, the balance of AOCI increased $1.4 billion due to increased interest rates and discount rates over the period.\nWe plan to use excess cash available at the Parent Company as efficiently as possible in the future. Excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the Parent Company from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt. The cash received by the Parent Company from our insurance subsidiaries is after they have made substantial investments during the year to grow the business. Possible uses of excess cash flow include, but are not limited to, share repurchases, acquisitions, shareholder dividend payments, investments in securities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our insurance subsidiaries. If market conditions are favorable, we currently expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.\nAs discussed in\n,\nthe Company adopted ASU 2018-12,\nFinancial Services–Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts (LDTI)\non January 1, 2023. The liability for future policy benefits under ASU 2018-12 is required to be computed using current discount rates with the impact of changes in discount rates included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Additionally, the guidance requires the liability for future policy benefits to be calculated using net premiums rather than gross premiums. Given that gross premiums are considerably higher than net premiums for our business, as seen in\n, the measurement of the liability is higher than what it would be had it been computed using gross premiums. This is an important consideration when analyzing shareholders' equity.\nWe maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policy liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in market rates.\nWhile a majority of invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity. Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity, an inconsistency\n47\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nexists in measurement, which may have a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders’ equity, capital structure, and financial ratios. Due to the long-term nature of our fixed maturity investments and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by market rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.\nFinancial Strength Ratings.\nThe financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by Standard & Poor’s and A. M. Best. The following table presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2023.\nA.M. Best states that it assigns an A (Excellent) rating to insurance companies that have, in its opinion, an excellent ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations.\nThe AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P) to those insurers which have very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments which differs from the highest-rated insurers only to a small degree. An insurer rated A has strong capacity to meet its financial commitments but it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than insurers in higher-rated categories. The plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category.\nOTHER ITEMS\nLitigation.\nFor more information concerning litigation, please refer to\n.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management reviews these key estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements on a timely basis. If management determines that modifications are necessary due to current facts and circumstances, the Company’s results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could possibly change significantly. Additional information on our accounting policies is disclosed in\n.\nFuture Policy Benefits.\nConsiderable information concerning the policies, procedures, and other relevant data related to the valuation of our liability for future policy benefits is presented in\nand\n.\nThe liability for future policy benefits for traditional and limited-payment long duration life and health products comprises the vast majority of the total liability for future policy benefits for the Company. The liability is determined each reporting period based on the net level premium method. This method requires the liability for future policy benefits to be calculated as the present value of estimated future policyholder benefits and the related termination expenses, less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected from policyholders.\n48\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nThe Company reviews, and updates as necessary, its cash flow assumptions (mortality, morbidity, and lapses) used to calculate the change in the liability for future policy benefits at least annually. These cash flow assumptions are reviewed at the same time every year, or more frequently, if suggested by experience. If cash flow assumptions are changed, the net premium ratio is recalculated from the original issue date, or the Transition Date, using actual experience and projected future cash flows. As cash flow assumptions are changed, the liability for future policy benefits is adjusted with changes recognized in policyholder benefits on the\n.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of our liability for future policy benefits, including the corresponding pre-tax impact on OCI, and net income, as of December 31, 2023, to changes in cash flow assumptions. This information is useful in understanding the potential financial impact on our financial statements from changes in these items and the expected impact to our liability for future policy benefits. We could experience impacts that are more or less significant than noted in the following analysis; however the sensitivities provide insight regarding the direction and magnitude of those potential impacts.\nThe liability for future policy benefits is discounted using a current upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yield that reflects the duration characteristics of the liability for future policy benefits. Accordingly, the discount rate assumption is key in determining the change in the value of the liability for future benefits for long duration life and health contracts. Since the liability for future policy benefits for traditional and limited-payment long duration life and health products comprises approximately 92% of the total liability for future policy benefits, it is subject to interest rate risk. A decrease in discount rates will cause an increase in the obligation with a corresponding change in AOCI.\nThe following table illustrates the interest rate sensitivity of our liability for future policy benefits as of December 31, 2023. This table measures the effect of a parallel shift in discount rates on the liability. The data measures the change in reported value arising from an immediate change in rates in increments of 50 and 100 basis points, which would be recorded as a component of OCI.\nValue of Liability for Future Policy Benefits\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n(1) In basis points.\n49\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nDeferred Acquisition Costs.\nCertain costs of acquiring new insurance business are deferred and recorded as an asset. These costs are capitalized on a grouped contract basis and amortized over the expected term of the related contracts, and are essential for the acquisition of new insurance business.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) are amortized on a constant-level basis over the expected term of the grouped contracts, with the related expense included in amortization of deferred acquisition costs on the\n. The in-force metric used to compute the DAC amortization rate is annualized premium in force. The assumptions used to amortize acquisition costs include mortality, morbidity, and lapses, and are consistent with those used in calculating the liability for future policy benefits.\nValue of business acquired (VOBA) is amortized on a basis that is consistent with DAC, as described above, and is subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing to determine if there is a premium deficiency. These tests evaluate whether the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized VOBA asset. These cash flows consist primarily of premium income, less benefits and expenses. The present value of these cash flows, less the reserve liability, is then compared with the unamortized balance. In the event the estimated present value of net cash flows is less, the deficiency would be recognized by a charge to earnings and either a reduction of unamortized acquisition costs or an increase in the liability for future benefits.\nPolicy Claims and Other Benefits Payable.\nThis liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. The Company concludes that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience. There were no significant changes in the claims process in the current year.\nValuation of Fixed Maturities.\nWe hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time to maximize risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns. We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets. Because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio and the long average life, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption\nMarket Risk Sensitivity\nin this report. However, as discussed under the caption\nin this report, the Company regards these unrealized fluctuations in value as having no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.\nAt times, the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets. Illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening, and accordingly to unrealized losses, on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and general intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in\nand in\nunder the captions\nFair Value Measurements\nin both notes. There were no significant changes in the valuation process in the current year.\nMarket Risk Sensitivity.\nGlobe Life's investment securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio. Since 91% of the carrying value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments and these investments are predominately fixed-rate investments, the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates\n50\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\ngenerally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio rising, and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline. Under normal market conditions, we are not concerned about unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. Globe Life does not generally intend to sell the securities prior to maturity and, likely, will not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of amortized cost. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong operating cash-flow substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio.\nThe following table illustrates the interest rate sensitivity of our fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2023. This table measures the effect of a parallel shift in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio. The data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.\nMarket Value of Fixed Maturity Portfolio\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n(1) In basis points.\nInvestments: Allowance for Credit Losses.\nWe continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value to determine if a credit loss event has occurred. When a credit event does occur, an allowance for credit loss is recorded and the corresponding provision is recognized in the\nin Realized Gains or Losses. Non-credit related fluctuations in the fair value are recorded in\nOther Comprehensive Income\n. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for allowance for credit losses are disclosed in\nand the discussions under the captions\nInvestments\nand\nRealized Gains and\nLosses\nin this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an allowance for credit loss, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.\nDefined benefit pension plans.\nWe maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plan covering a limited number of officers. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At December 31, 2023, our gross liability under these plans was $628 million, but was offset by assets of $571 million.\nThe actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations/expenses for pensions include: employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. Additionally, a corridor approach is used to amortize any unrecognized gains or losses outside the corridor (the standard 10% of the greater of plan PBO and fair value assets) and have an amortization service period of approximately nine years. These assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans. For example, a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2023 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023.\n51\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nPension Assumptions\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n(1)\nIn basis points.\n(2)\nThe discount rate for determining the net periodic benefit cost was 5.71% for 2023. The discount rate used for determining the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023 was 5.40%.\n(3)\nThe expected long-term return rate assumed was 6.98% at December 31, 2023, and 6.98% in the prior year. Management considers both historical and future yields to determine the expected return.\nThe Company determines mortality assumptions through the use of published mortality tables that reflect broad-based studies of mortality and published longevity improvement scales.\nThe criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in\n.\nWhile we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from Company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. The assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to us.\nalso contains information about pension plan assets, investment policies, and other related data.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting, measurement, and disclosure of long-duration contracts effective January 1, 2023, using the modified retrospective method applied as of the transition date of January 1, 2021, due to adoption of ASU 2018-12,\nFinancial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\n(“ASU 2018-12”). The adoption is also communicated as a critical audit matter below.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n54\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nAdoption of Accounting Pronouncements - Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts - Refer to Note 1 to the Financial Statements (also see Change in Accounting Principle explanatory paragraph above)\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company adopted ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective application as of the transition date of January 1, 2021.\nThe adoption of ASU 2018-12 significantly modified the Company’s accounting for and disclosure of long-duration life and health insurance contracts. We identified the adoption of ASU 2018-12 as a critical audit matter because of the need to involve actuarial specialists to evaluate assumptions and valuation models, the extent of audit effort required, and the inherent complexity involved in the selection and application of new accounting policies.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the adoption of ASU 2018-12 included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the application of new accounting policies and disclosure of the impact of adoption discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, including controls over the valuation models and assumptions used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits and amortization of deferred acquisition costs.\n•\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s selection and application of accounting policies in connection with the adoption of the ASU 2018-12.\n•\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation models and assumptions used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits and amortization of deferred acquisition costs.\nFuture Policy Benefits at Current Discount Rates and Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\n— Certain Underlying Assumptions for Certain Products – Refer to Notes 1, 6 and 7 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company estimates the liability for future policy benefits based on the net level premium method, which requires a calculation of the present value of estimated future policyholder benefits and the related claim adjustment expenses, less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected from policyholders. The Company estimates the amortization of deferred acquisition costs on a constant-level basis over the expected term of the grouped contracts.\nThe most significant assumptions used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits and amortization of deferred acquisition costs for certain products are mortality, morbidity and lapse. The Company regularly reviews these assumptions, which are updated as necessary in the third quarter of every year, or more frequently if suggested by experience. The mortality, morbidity, and lapse assumptions are determined based upon Company experience and industry data.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty and extent of specialized skill required in assessing the mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions, auditing the development of these assumptions for certain products involved especially subjective judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s judgments regarding the mortality, morbidity, and lapse assumptions used in the development of future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for certain insurance products, included the following, among others:\n55\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the development of these assumptions used in the valuation of future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for certain insurance products, including the effectiveness of the controls over the underlying data.\n•\nWe tested the underlying data used in the development of these assumptions as well as in the valuation of future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for certain insurance products.\n•\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we:\n◦\nevaluated management’s methods, calculations and judgments regarding the development of these assumptions used in the valuation of future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for certain insurance products.\n◦\nevaluated on a sample basis, through independent calculation of future policy benefits and amortization of deferred acquisition costs, the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations, the appropriateness of valuation models, and whether these assumptions were properly applied.\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nDallas, Texas\nFebruary 28, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999.\n56\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nPrior period amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023.\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n57\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n(1)\nNet of the total remeasurement, including both the impact of assumption changes and the effect of actual to expected experience adjustments, resulting in gains (losses) of $\n29.4\nmillion, $(\n47.4\n) million and $(\n11.1\n) million for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(2)\nNet of the total remeasurement, including both the impact of assumption changes and the effect of actual to expected experience adjustments, resulting in gains (losses) of $\n11.8\nmillion, $\n15.6\nmillion and $(\n1.2\n) million for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and  2021, respectively.\nPrior period amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023.\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n58\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nPrior period amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023.\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n59\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nPrior period amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023.\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n60\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nPrior period amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023.\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n61\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nNote 1—Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness\n:\n(Globe Life), (the Company), refers to Globe Life Inc., an insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware in 1979, and Globe Life Inc. subsidiaries and affiliates.

(Parent Company).\nGlobe Life provides a variety of life and supplemental health insurance products and annuities to a broad base of customers. The Company is organized into\nfour\nreportable segments: life insurance, supplemental health insurance, annuities, and investments.\nGlobe Life markets its insurance products through a number of distribution channels, each of which sells the products of one or more of Globe Life's insurance segments. Our distribution channels consist of the following exclusive agencies: American Income Life Division (American Income), Liberty National Division (Liberty National) and Family Heritage Division (Family Heritage); an independent agency, United American Division (United American); and our Direct to Consumer Division (DTC).\nBasis of Presentation\n:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of Globe Life have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), under guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nUse of Estimates\n:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See further documentation in the significant accounting policies or the accompanying notes.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n:\nThe consolidated financial statements include the results of Globe Life Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. When Globe Life acquires a subsidiary or a block of business, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Any excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets is recorded as goodwill. Expenses incurred to effect the acquisition are charged to earnings as of the acquisition date. Upon acquisition, the accounts and results of operations are consolidated as of and subsequent to the acquisition date.\nAcquisition\n:\nOn August 1, 2021, the Company acquired Beazley Benefits, an operating unit of Beazley Insurance Company, Inc. for $\n59.2\nmillion. In conjunction with this agreement, the Company also executed a 100% coinsurance agreement assuming the remaining inforce business produced by the unit. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting as required by GAAP. This guidance requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The goodwill related to the purchase is due to expected synergies as a result of combining operations with other factors. The results of operations since the acquisition date have been consolidated. The cash flows associated with the purchase are recorded in the\nin \"Other investing activities.\"\nInvestments\n:\nGlobe Life classifies all of its fixed maturity investments as available for sale. Investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reflected directly in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Income from investments is recorded in \"Net investment income\" on the\n. Gains and losses from sales, maturities, or other\n62\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nredemptions of investments are recorded in \"Realized gains (losses)\". Gains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. Interest income and prepayment fees are recognized when earned. Premiums and discounts are amortized using the effective yield method. When amortized cost of a callable debt security exceeds the first call price, the premium is amortized to the earliest call date. Otherwise, the period of amortization or accretion generally extends from the purchase date to the maturity date.\n\"Policy loans\", which represent loans provided to policyholders using cash values as collateral, are carried at unpaid principal balances.\n\"Mortgage loans\" or commercial mortgage loans, are a type of investment where the mortgage loan is shared among investors, are accounted for as financing receivables. The commercial mortgage loans are managed by a third party. The Company purchased the legal rights to interests in commercial mortgage loans which are secured by properties such as hotels, retail, multiple family, or offices. The commercial mortgage loans typically have a term of\n3\nyears with the option to extend up to\n2\nyears. The commercial mortgage loans are recorded at unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized origination fees and net of allowance for loan losses. Interest income, net of the amortization of origination fees, is recorded in \"Net investment income\" under the effective yield method. Our unfunded commitment balance to the commercial loan borrowers was $\n25\nmillion as of December 31, 2023.\n\"Other long-term investments\" include investment funds, equity securities, and real estate. Investments in equity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value, net of taxes, reflected directly in \"Realized gains (losses)\" in the\n. Investments in real estate are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.\nThe investment funds consist of limited partnerships whereby the Company has a pro-rata share of ownership ranging from less than\n1\n% to\n20\n%. For each investment, the Company has elected the fair value option, but would have been otherwise accounted for as an equity method investment. The fair value option is assessed for each individual investment and concluded at the inception of the investment.\nEach limited partnership investment is evaluated under applicable GAAP to determine if it is a variable interest entity (VIE) and would qualify for consolidation. Only primary beneficiaries are required or allowed to consolidate VIEs. The investments are not consolidated because the Company has no power to control the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of these entities and therefore the Company is not the primary beneficiary of any of these interests. Globe Life's involvement is limited to its limited partnership interest in the entities. The Company has not provided any other financial support to the entities beyond its commitments to fund its limited partnership interests, and there are no arrangements or agreements with any of the interests to provide other financial support. The maximum loss exposure relative to these interests is limited to their carrying value and future commitments. The Company has approximately\n2\n% of total assets in low-income housing tax credits and certain limited partnerships (investment funds) that qualify as unconsolidated VIEs.\nThe limited partnership investments are reported at the Company's pro-rata share of the investment fund's net asset value or its equivalent (NAV), as a practical expedient for fair value. Changes in the NAV are recorded in net income and increase the carrying value on the balance sheet. The amount of change in NAV attributable to the net operating results of the fund is recorded in \"Net investment income\" with the remaining balance of the change reflected in \"Realized gains (losses).\" Distributions received from the funds reduce the carrying value. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to the outstanding carrying value and future funding commitments. The Company had $\n154\nmillion of capital called during the year from existing investment funds, reducing our unfunded commitments. Our unfunded commitments were $\n744\nmillion as of December 31, 2023.\n\"Short-term investments\" include investments in interest-bearing assets with original maturities of twelve months or less.\n63\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nFair Value Measurements, Investments in Securities\n: Globe Life measures the fair value of its \"fixed maturities\" based on a hierarchy consisting of three levels which indicate the quality of the fair value measurements as described below:\n•\nLevel 1—\nfair values are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date.\n•\nLevel 2—\nfair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that can otherwise be corroborated by observable market data.\n•\nLevel 3—\nfair values are based on inputs that are considered unobservable where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability as of the measurement date. In this circumstance, the Company has to rely on values derived by independent brokers or internally-developed assumptions. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available to the Company which may include the Company’s own data or bid and ask prices in the dealer market.\nCertain investments, such as investment funds, that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share or its equivalent, as a practical expedient, have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The net asset value is provided by general partners or managers.\nThe great majority of Globe Life's \"fixed maturities\" are not actively traded and direct quotes are not generally available. Management therefore determines the fair values of these securities after consideration of data provided by third-party pricing services, independent broker/dealers, and other resources. At December 31, 2023, the Company's investments in fixed maturities were primarily composed of the following significant security types: corporate securities, state and municipal securities, U.S. government direct, guaranteed, and government-sponsored enterprises securities. The remaining security types represented approximately\n1\n% of the total in the aggregate.\nApproximately\n97\n% of the fair value of \"fixed maturities\" reported at December 31, 2023 was determined using data provided by third-party pricing services. Prices provided by these services are not binding offers, but are estimated exit values. Third-party pricing services use proprietary pricing models to determine security values by discounting cash flows using a market-adjusted spread to a benchmark yield.\nFor all asset classes within Globe Life's significant security types, third-party pricing services use a common valuation technique to model the price of the investments using observable market data. The foundation for these models consists of developing yield spreads based on multiple observable market inputs, including but not limited to: benchmark yield curves, actual trading activity, new issue yields, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, sector-specific data, economic data, and other inputs that are corroborated in the market. Pricing vendors monitor and review their pricing data continuously with current market and economic data feeds, augmented by ongoing communication within the dealer community.\nUsing the observable market inputs described above, spreads to an appropriate benchmark yield are further developed by the vendors for each security based on security-specific and/or sector-specific risk factors, such as a security’s terms and conditions (coupon, maturity, and call features), credit rating, sector, liquidity, collateral or other cash flow options, and other factors that could impact the risk of the security. Embedded repayment options, such as call and redemption features, are also taken into account in the pricing models. When the spread is determined, it is added to the security’s benchmark yield. The security's expected cash flows are discounted using this spread-adjusted yield, and the resulting present value of the discounted cash flows is the evaluated price.\nWhen third-party vendor prices are not available, the Company attempts to obtain valuations from other sources, including but not limited to broker/dealers, broker quotes, and prices on comparable securities.\n64\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nWhen valuations have been obtained for all securities in the portfolio, management reviews and analyzes the prices to ensure their reasonableness, taking into account available and observable information. When two or more valuations are available for a security and the variance between the prices is 10% or less, the close correlation suggests similar observable inputs were used in deriving the price, and the mean of the prices is used. Securities valued in this manner are classified as Level 2. When the variance between two or more valuations for a security exceeds 10%, additional analysis is performed to determine the most appropriate value for that security, using resources such as broker quotes, prices on comparable securities, recent trades, and any other observable market data. Further review is performed on the available valuations to determine if they can be corroborated within reasonable tolerance to any other observable evidence. If one of the valuations or the mean of the available valuations for a security can be corroborated with other observable evidence, then the corroborated value is used and reported as Level 2. The Company uses information and analytical techniques deemed appropriate for determining the point within the range of reasonable fair value estimates that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions. Valuations that cannot be corroborated within a reasonable tolerance are classified as Level 3.\nGlobe Life invests in a portfolio of private placement fixed maturities. Private placement fixed maturities are generally not an active market. This portfolio is managed by third parties. The portfolio managers provide valuations for the bonds based on a pricing matrix utilizing observable inputs, such as the benchmark treasury rate and published sector indices, and unobservable inputs such as an internally-developed credit rating. If observable inputs cannot be corroborated, the fair values are classified as Level 3. Refer to\nunder the caption\nQuantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements\n.\nThe fair values for each class of security and by valuation hierarchy level are indicated in\nunder the caption\nFair value measurements,\nand\nunder the caption\nPension Assets\n.\nFair Value Measurements, Other Financial Instruments\n:\nFair values for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term debt, receivables, and payables approximate carrying value. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1. Fair values of commercial mortgage loans are determined based upon expected cash flows discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate and are classified as Level 3. The fair value of investments in limited partnerships that provide low-income housing tax credits is based on discounted projected cash flows and are classified as Level 3. Policy loans are an integral part of Globe Life's subsidiaries’ life insurance policies in force and their fair values cannot be valued separately from the insurance contracts. Investment funds are based on net asset value and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy.\nThe fair values of Globe Life's long and short-term debt issues are based on the same methodology as investments in fixed maturities. At December 31, 2023, observable inputs were available for these debt securities and as such were classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy. The fair value for each debt instrument as of December 31, 2023 is disclosed in\n.\nAs described in\n, Globe Life maintains a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan. Accordingly, the assets that support the liability for this plan are considered general assets of the Company. These assets consist of the cash value of corporate-owned life insurance policies (COLI) and exchange traded funds (ETFs). The fair value of the insurance cash values approximates carrying value. Fair values for the ETFs are derived from direct quotes and are considered Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nCurrent Expected Credit Loss Reserve (fixed maturities)\n:\nAt the onset of the evaluation, the Company individually assesses each fixed maturity, on a quarterly basis, to determine whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria are met, the Company will write down the fixed maturity's amortized cost basis to fair value through \"Realized gains (losses)\".\nIf neither of the aforementioned criteria are met, the Company will evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from a credit event. The Company will evaluate many factors, as further described below, to determine the\n65\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\npresent value of the expected cash flows. A credit loss occurs when the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis. This will result in the recording of an allowance for credit losses as a contra asset account to the amortized cost basis with an offsetting provision for credit losses in\n\"\nRealized gains (losses)\"\non the\n. Additionally, the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology includes a fair value floor where the allowance for credit loss for a security cannot exceed the difference between fair value and amortized cost. When it is determined that there is not a credit loss, the decline in fair value is recognized in\n.\nAll changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses recorded to the allowance for credit losses are management's best estimate of the uncollectibility of principal and interest of a fixed maturity.\nThe evaluation of Globe Life's securities for credit losses is a process that is undertaken at least quarterly and is overseen by a team of investment and accounting professionals. The process for making this determination is highly subjective and involves the careful consideration of many factors. The factors considered include, but are not limited to:\n•\nThe Company’s lack of intent to sell the debt security before recovery;\n•\nWhether it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell prior to maturity;\n•\nThe reason(s) for the credit related losses;\n•\nThe financial condition of the issuer and the prospects for recovery in fair value of the security;\n•\nExpected future cash flows.\nThe relative weight given to each of these factors can change over time as facts and circumstances change. In many cases, management believes it is appropriate to give more consideration to prospective factors than to retrospective factors. Prospective factors that are given more weight include prospects for recovery, the Company’s ability and general intent to hold the security until anticipated recovery, and expected future cash flows.\nAmong the facts and information considered in the process are:\n•\nFinancial statements of the issuer\n•\nChanges in credit ratings of the issuer\n•\nThe value of underlying collateral\n•\nNews and information included in press releases issued by the issuer\n•\nNews and information reported in the media concerning the issuer\n•\nNews and information published by or otherwise provided by securities, economic, or research analysts\n•\nThe nature and amount of recent and expected future sources and uses of cash\n•\nDefault on a required payment\n•\nIssuer bankruptcy filings\nThe expected cash flows are determined using judgment and the best information available to the Company. Inputs used to derive expected cash flows generally include expected default rates, current levels of subordination, and estimated recovery rate. The discount rate utilized in the discounted cash flows is the effective interest rate, which is the rate of return implicit in the asset at acquisition.\n66\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nCurrent Expected Credit Loss Reserve (mortgage loans)\n:\nThe Company evaluates the performance and credit quality of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio at least on a quarterly basis, or as needed, by utilizing common metrics such as loan-to-value or debt-service ratios as well as covenants, local market conditions, borrower quality, and underlying collateral. The fair value of the underlying collateral is based on a third-party appraisal of the property at origination of the loan. The fair value is assessed on an annual basis or more frequently when a loan is materially underperforming, 30 days delinquent, or in technical default. The Company determines the probability of estimated losses for the commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a pool basis each quarter and records an allowance. The allowance for credit losses is based on estimates, historical experience, probability of loss, value of the underlying collateral, and macro factors that affect the collectability of the loan.\nIf management determines that foreclosure of a particular property is probable, the Company may elect the practical expedient for an individual mortgage loan to estimate the expected credit losses, which are based on the fair value of the property less amortized cost, adjusted for selling and other associated costs.\nSee\nfor current activity.\nCash\n: \"\nCash\" consists of balances on hand and on deposit in banks and financial institutions.\nAccrued investment income\n:\n\"Accrued investment income\" consists of interest income or dividends earned on the investment portfolio, but which are yet to be received as of the balance sheet date. The Company will write off accrued investment income that is deemed to be uncollectible related to the fixed maturities.\n\"\nAccrued investment income\n\" also consists of interest income earned on the commercial mortgage loan portfolio, but which is yet to be received as of the balance sheet date. Accrued investment income will be placed in non-accrual status at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent or otherwise deemed to be uncollectible by management. Any currently accrued investment income will subsequently be written off. As of December 31, 2023, the accrued interest receivable for commercial mortgage loans was $\n1.7\nmillion. Mortgage loans generally pay interest monthly, therefore accrued interest is typically for a period of less than 30 days.\nAs a practical expedient, the Company excludes the accrued investment income from the amortized cost basis of the investment and separately reports it in another financial statement line item, \"Accrued investment income.\" Accordingly, the amount will be excluded from disclosures within\n.\nOther Receivables\n:\nAgent debit balances primarily represent commissions advanced to insurance agents, a common industry practice. These balances are repaid to the Company over time, generally one year, as the premiums associated with the advanced commissions are collected by the Company and a portion of the agents' commissions on such premiums are retained in order to repay the balances. The balances were $\n501\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and $\n460\nmillion at December 31, 2022. When an agent sells a policy, commissions are advanced to the agent, and the collection of the advance is made as long as the policy stays in force. While there is a susceptibility to loss should an agent terminate or excessive policy lapses occur, the ability of the Company to continue to collect an agent's commission streams over time from prior sales of policies reduces the Company's exposure to loss.\nThe Company has a very low inherent risk with regard to the collection of agent debit balances and views these balances as recoverable since they are, in aggregate, less than the estimated present value of future commissions discounted at a conservative rate which includes assumptions for lapses and mortality. The Company’s security, or collateral, is in the form of future commission streams collected over the life of the policies sold by the respective agents, which ultimately revert to the Company in the event an agent is terminated. The Company evaluated the agent debit balances on a pool basis to determine the allowance for credit losses, as the loans have similar characteristics. A provision for credit losses will be recorded in \"Realized gains (losses)\" on the\nand the asset balance will be reflected in agent debit balances, net of allowance for credit losses (\"Other receivables\"). Based on factors considered by management, there were no additional credit losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was $\n1.2\nmillion.\n67\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\n: Certain costs of acquiring new insurance business are deferred and recorded as an asset. These costs are capitalized on a grouped contract basis and amortized over the expected term of the related contracts, and are essential for the acquisition of new insurance business. Deferred acquisition costs (DAC) are directly related to the successful issuance of an insurance contract, and primarily include sales commissions, policy issue costs, direct to consumer advertising costs, and underwriting costs. Additionally, DAC includes the value of business acquired (VOBA), which are the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies. These costs represent the difference between the fair value of the contractual insurance assets acquired and liabilities assumed, compared against the assets and liabilities for insurance contracts that the company issues or holds measured in accordance with GAAP.\nDAC is amortized on a constant-level basis over the expected term of the grouped contracts, with the related expense included in amortization of deferred acquisition costs on the\n. The in-force metric used to compute the DAC amortization rate is annualized premium in force. The assumptions used to amortize acquisition costs include mortality, morbidity, and lapses. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually and revised in conjunction with any change in the future policy benefit assumptions. The effect of changes in the assumptions are recognized over the remaining expected contract term as a revision of future amortization amounts.\nVOBA is amortized on a basis that is consistent with DAC, as described above, and is subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing to determine if there is a premium deficiency. These tests evaluate whether the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized VOBA asset. These cash flows consist primarily of premium income, less benefits and expenses. The present value of these cash flows, less the reserve liability, is then compared with the unamortized balance. In the event the estimated present value of net cash flows is less, the deficiency would be recognized by a charge to earnings and either a reduction of unamortized acquisition costs or an increase in the liability for future benefits.\nRefer to\n.\nAdvertising Costs\n: Costs related to advertising are generally charged to expense as incurred. However, certain Direct to Consumer advertising costs are capitalized when there is a reliable and demonstrated relationship between total costs and future benefits that is a direct result of incurring these costs. Direct to Consumer advertising costs consist primarily of internet advertising costs and the production and distribution costs of direct mail advertising materials, and when capitalized are included as a component of DAC. Additionally, they are amortized in the same manner as other DAC.\nDirect to Consumer advertising costs charged to earnings and included in commissions, premium taxes, and non-deferred acquisition costs were $\n19.2\nmillion, $\n9.4\nmillion, and $\n10.0\nmillion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Unamortized capitalized advertising costs included within DAC were $\n1.6\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and $\n1.5\nbillion at December 31, 2022.\nGoodwill\n:\nThe excess cost of a business acquired over the fair value of net assets acquired is reported as goodwill. In accordance with the guidance, goodwill is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur. Impairment testing involves the performance of a qualitative analysis, which involves assessing current events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In the event the fair value is less than the carrying value, further testing is required to determine the amount of impairment, if any. If there is an impairment in the goodwill of any reporting unit, it is written down and charged to earnings in the period of the test. Globe Life tests its goodwill annually as of June 30th for each of the years 2021 through 2023. The Company's goodwill was not impaired in any of those periods.\nLow-Income Housing Tax Credit Interests\n:\nGlobe Life invests in limited partnerships that provide low-income housing tax credits and other related federal income tax benefits to the Company. Globe Life holds passive interests in limited partnerships that provide investment returns through the provision of tax benefits (principally from the transfer of federal or state tax credits related to federal low-income housing). These investments are considered to be VIEs and do not qualify for consolidation. The carrying value of the Company's investment in these entities was $\n267\nmillion and $\n315\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was included in \"Other assets\" on the\n.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Globe Life was obligated under future commitments of $\n72\nmillion, which are recorded in \"Other liabilities\". For guaranteed investments acquired prior to January 1, 2015, the Company utilizes the effective-yield method of amortization, while the proportional method of amortization is\n68\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nutilized for all non-guaranteed and guaranteed investments acquired on or after January 1, 2015. All net amortization expense and income tax benefits are recorded in \"Income tax benefit (expense)\" on the\n.\nProperty and Equipment\n:\nProperty and equipment, included in “Other assets,” is reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets which range from\nthree\nto\nfifteen years\nfor equipment and software, and\nfifteen\nto\nforty years\nfor buildings and improvements. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. Impairments, if any, are recorded when certain events and circumstances become evident that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Original cost of property and equipment was $\n455\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and $\n406\nmillion at December 31, 2022. Accumulated depreciation was $\n215\nmillion at the end of 2023 and $\n194\nmillion at the end of 2022. Depreciation expense was $\n21\nmillion in 2023, $\n21\nmillion in 2022, and $\n20\nmillion in 2021. Internally generated software costs are expensed as incurred in the preliminary project phase and post-implementation phase, and are capitalized during the application development stage. Additionally, implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract are capitalized.\nSee below for a breakout of the net balance by asset class for the year-ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nFuture Policy Benefits\n:\nThe liability for future policy benefits for traditional and limited-payment long duration life and health products comprises approximately\n92\n% of the total liability for future policy benefits. The liability is determined each reporting period based on the net level premium method. This method requires the liability for future policy benefits be calculated as the present value of estimated future policyholder benefits and the related termination expenses, less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected from policyholders. Net level premiums reflect a recomputed net premium ratio using actual experience since the issue date or the Transition Date\n1\n, and expected future experience. The liability is accrued as premium revenue is recognized and adjusted for differences between actual and expected experience. Long-duration insurance contracts issued by the Company are grouped into cohorts based on the contract issue year, distribution channel, legal entity, and product type.\nBoth the present value of expected future benefit payments and the present value of expected future net premiums are based primarily on assumptions of discount rates, mortality, morbidity, and lapses. Each quarter, the Company remeasures its liability for future policy benefits using current discount rates with the effect of the change recognized in Other Comprehensive Income, a component of shareholders’ equity. In addition, the Company recognizes a liability remeasurement gain or loss within the\nusing original discount rates, and relating to actual experience under the net premium calculation, as compared to the prior reporting period assumptions.\nThe Company regularly reviews its cash flow assumptions (mortality, morbidity, and lapses) used to calculate the change in the liability for future policy benefits. These cash flow assumptions are updated as necessary in the third quarter of every year, or more frequently if suggested by experience. If cash flow assumptions are changed, the net premium ratio is recalculated from the original issue date, or the Transition Date, using actual experience and projected future cash flows. When the expected future net premiums exceed the expected future gross premiums\n1\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2018-12,\nFinancial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\n(ASU 2018-12) on a modified retrospective basis as the transition date (Transition Date) of January 1, 2021. For additional information, refer to the 'Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Current Year' section below.\n69\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n(capping), or the present value of future policyholder benefits exceeds the present value of expected future gross premiums (flooring), the liability for future policy benefits is adjusted with changes recognized in policyholder benefits on the\n. The cash flow assumptions do not include an adjustment for adverse deviation. Mortality tables used for individual life insurance include various industry tables and reflect modifications based on Company experience. Morbidity assumptions for individual health are based on Company experience and industry data. Lapse assumptions are based on Company experience.\nThe liability for future policy benefits is discounted as noted above, using a current upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yield that reflects the duration characteristics of the liability for future policy benefits. The methodology for determining current discount rates consists of constructing a discount rate curve intended to be reflective of the currency and tenor of the insurance liability cash flows. The methodology is designed to prioritize observable inputs based on market data available in the local debt markets denominated in the same currency as the policies. For the discount rates applicable to tenors for which the single-A debt market is not liquid or there is little or no observable market data, the Company will use estimation techniques consistent with the fair value guidance in ASC 820. We further accrete interest as a component of policyholder benefits using the original discount rate that is locked-in during the year of contract issuance. The original discount rates (or the locked-in discount rates) are used for interest accretion purposes and for the determination of net premiums, whereas the current discount rates are used for purposes of valuing the liability.\nThe liability for future policy benefits for annuity and interest sensitive life-type products is represented by policy account value. For limited-payment contracts, a deferred profit liability is also recorded, with changes recognized in income over the life of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance in force. Refer to\n.\nReinsuranc\ne\n: In the normal course of business, Globe Life insurance subsidiaries will enter into reinsurance agreements to limit their exposure to the risk of loss as well as enhance their capital position. To qualify for reinsurance accounting in accordance with applicable guidance, the assuming company (reinsurer) must have the “reasonable possibility” that it may realize a “significant loss.” In instances where the ceding company does not transfer significant insurance risk to the reinsurer, deposit accounting is utilized.

Refer to\nRecognition of Premium Revenue\nbelow.\nPolicy Claims and Other Benefits Payable\n:\nGlobe Life establishes a liability for known policy benefits payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company. Globe Life makes an estimate of unreported claims after careful evaluation of all information available to the Company. This estimate is based on prior experience and is reviewed quarterly. However, there is no certainty the stated liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, will be Globe Life's ultimate obligation.\nFor more information, see\n.\nCurrent and Deferred Income Taxes\n:\nCurrent and deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement book values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n70\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nPostretirement Benefits\n:\nGlobe Life accounts for its postretirement defined benefit plans by recognizing the funded status of those plans on its\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nin accordance with accounting guidance. Periodic gains and losses attributable to changes in plan assets and liabilities that are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs are recognized as components of other comprehensive income, net of tax.

Issuance of treasury stock is accounted for using the weighted-average cost method.\nMore information is found in\n.\nRecognition of Premium Revenue and Related Expenses\n:\nPremium income for traditional long-duration life and health insurance products is recognized evenly over the contract period and when due from the policyholder. Premiums for short-duration health contracts are recognized as revenue over the contract period in proportion to the insurance protection provided. Premiums for universal life-type and annuity contracts are added to the policy account value, and revenues for such products are recognized as charges to the policy account value for mortality, administration, and surrenders (retrospective deposit method). Life premium includes policy charges of $\n12.9\nmillion, $\n13.5\nmillion, and $\n14.2\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Other premium consists of annuity policy charges in each year. For most insurance products, the related benefits and expenses are matched with revenues by means of the provision of future policy benefits and the amortization of DAC in a manner which recognizes profits as they are earned over the revenue recognition period. For limited-payment life insurance products, the profits are recognized over the contract period.\nStock-Based Compensation\n:\nGlobe Life accounts for stock-based compensation by recognizing an expense in the consolidated financial statements based on the “fair value method.” The fair value method requires that a fair value be assigned to a stock option or other stock grant on its grant date and that this value be amortized over the grantees’ service period.\nThe fair value method requires the use of an option valuation model to value employee stock options. Globe Life has elected to use the Black-Scholes valuation model for option expensing.\nA summary of assumptions for options granted in each of the three years 2021 through 2023 is as follows:\nThe expected term is generally derived from Company experience. However, expected terms are determined based on the simplified method as permitted under the ASC 718,\nStock Compensation,\ntopic when Company experience is insufficient. On April 26, 2018, the shareholders approved the Globe Life Inc. 2018 Incentive Plan, formerly the Torchmark Corporation 2018 Incentive Plan (the \"2018 Incentive Plan\"). The 2018 Incentive Plan replaced all previous plans. The 2018 Incentive Plan allows for option grants for employees with a\nseven-year\ncontractual term which vest over\nthree years\nin addition to\nten-year\ngrants which vest over\nfive years\nas permitted by the previous plans. Director grants vest over\nsix months\n. Volatility and risk-free interest rates are assumed over a period of time consistent with the expected term of the option. Volatility is measured on a historical basis. Monthly data points are utilized to derive volatility for periods\nthree years\nand longer. Expected dividend yield is based on current dividend yield held constant over the expected term. Once the fair value of an option has been determined, it is amortized on a straight-line basis over the employee’s service period for that grant (from the grant date to the date the grant is fully vested). Expenses for restricted stock and restricted stock units are based on the grant date fair value allocated on a straight-line basis over the service period. Performance share expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of the probability of meeting the metrics identified in the performance share award agreement, assigned to each service period as these estimates develop.\n71\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nStock-based compensation expense is included in “Other operating expense” in the\n. Globe Life management views all stock-based compensation expense as a Corporate and Other expense and, therefore, presents it as such in its segment analysis.\nMore information concerning the Company's segments is provided in\n.\nEarnings per Share\n:\nGlobe Life presents basic and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) on the face of the\nfor income from operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by adding to shares outstanding the additional net effect of potentially dilutive securities or contracts, such as stock options, which could be exercised or converted into common shares.\nFor more information on earnings per share, see\n.\nImmaterial Correction of Previously Issued Financial Statements\n:\nThe Company previously accounted for certain group Medicare supplement policies with termination clauses as long-duration contracts. The termination clause precludes the insurance policies from being guaranteed renewable contracts and accordingly should be accounted for as short-duration contracts. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2018-12, the Company changed this accounting, with corresponding adjustments to DAC, future policy benefits, and retained earnings, resulting in an increase of $\n26.5\nmillion, net of tax, to the opening retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2021.\nThe Company also previously presented reinsurance recoverable on a net basis as a component of policy liabilities. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company corrected its presentation for reinsurance recoverable to a gross basis as a component of other assets, which resulted in the reclassification of $\n59.7\nmillion, $\n82.4\nmillion, and $\n49.9\nmillion of reinsurance recoverable from liabilities to assets as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe balance sheet and related footnotes for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect such changes.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Current Year\n: On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2018-12 (also referred to as Long Duration Targeted Improvements or LDTI) on a modified retrospective basis as of the transition date (Transition Date) of January 1, 2021\n.\nThe amended guidance is a significant change to the accounting and disclosure of long-duration life and health insurance contracts. The modified retrospective transition method requires the updated standard be applied to all long-duration life and health contracts, which has resulted in the adjustment of the 2021 and 2022 consolidated financial statements.\nThe following tables summarize the balance of and changes to the liability for future policy benefits for traditional life and health long-duration contracts on the Transition Date due to the adoption of ASU 2018-12:\n72\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n(1)\nWhen the present value of expected future net premiums exceeds the present value of expected future gross premiums for a given cohort (capping), or the present value of future policy benefits and related termination expenses exceeds the present value of expected future net premiums (flooring), an adjustment is made to the liability for future policy benefits.\n(2)\nThe amounts presented herein have been updated to reflect the immaterial correction of an error, as noted above.\nThe following table presents total policy liabilities, both before and after the Transition Date:\n(1)\nIn addition to the discount rate related adjustments to future policy benefits, the Company reclassified certain balances within total policy liabilities on the\nas a result of adopting ASU 2018-12. The reclassifications had an immaterial impact on Shareholders' Equity. See table summarizing the transition adjustments to Shareholders' Equity below.\n(2)\nThe Company's additional insurance liabilities consist primarily of: 1) deferred profit liability on limited-payment contracts; and 2) reserves on deferred annuity and interest sensitive life blocks of business. See\nfor additional information.\n(3)\nThe amounts presented herein have been updated to reflect the immaterial correction of an error, as noted above.\n73\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nThe following table presents the Company's deferred policy acquisition costs before and after the Transition Date:\n(1)\nThe amounts presented herein have been updated to reflect the immaterial correction of an error, as noted above.\nIn accordance with ASU 2018-12, the Company has adjusted its DAC balance to remove the impact of unrealized gains and losses that were previously recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) on the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity. Under prior guidance, the Company included these amounts within its calculation of amortization.\nThe following table presents the effect of transition adjustments due to the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on shareholders' equity:\n(1)\nOther represents common stock, additional paid-in capital, and treasury stock, combining balances that were unaffected by the new standard.\n(2)\nOther adjustments relates to an immaterial correction of an error, as noted above.\nAs of the Transition Date, the primary effects of the changes required by the standard were to AOCI and retained earnings. As seen in the table above, the transition adjustments impacting AOCI consist of the effect of changes in discount rate assumptions and the effect of the removal of unrealized gains (losses) on DAC. The effect of changes in discount rate assumptions is the impact, net of tax, of the Company re-measuring its liability for future policy benefits using current discount rates. As of the Transition Date, we experienced a lower level of current discount rates than the original discount rates used in valuing our future policy benefits under the prior guidance, thus reducing Shareholders' Equity. For the effect of removing unrealized gains (losses) on DAC, this adjustment relates\n74\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nto the requirement to remove unrealized gains (losses) that were included within the amortization calculation, as noted previously.\nRegarding the impact on retained earnings, when the present value of net premiums exceeds the present value of gross premiums for a given cohort (capping), or the present value of future benefits and related termination expenses exceeds the present value of future gross premiums (flooring), an adjustment is recognized to the liability for future policy benefits. Any blocks of business that require increases in future policy benefits to minimum levels, or that have a net premium ratio greater than 100%, required an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (decrease).\nAccounting Pronouncements Yet to be Adopted\n:\nASU No. 2022-03\n,\nFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,\nadds disclosure requirements specific to equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions.

Transfers out of Level 3 occur when quoted prices in active markets becomes available for identical assets/ liabilities or the ability to corroborate by observable market data.\nThe following table represents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements:\n(1)\nUnobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments.\nThe private placement fixed maturities reported as Level 3, are managed by third-party investment managers. These securities are valued based on the contractual cash flows discounted by a yield determined as a treasury benchmark adjusted for a credit spread. The credit spread is developed from observable indices for similar public fixed maturities and unobservable indices for private fixed maturities for corresponding credit ratings. However, the credit ratings for the securities are considered unobservable inputs, as they are assigned by the third-party investment manager based on a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit underwritten. A higher (lower) credit rating would result in a higher (lower) valuation.\nThe collateral underlying collateralized debt obligations consists primarily of trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies. Collateralized debt obligations are valued at the present value of expected future cash flows using an unobservable discount rate. Expected cash flows are determined by scheduling the projected repayment of the collateral assuming no future defaults, deferrals, or recoveries. The discount rate is risk-adjusted to take these items into account. A significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate will produce a significant decrease (increase) in fair value. Additionally, a significant increase (decrease) in the cash flow expectations would result in a significant increase (decrease) in fair value.

Life reinsurance assumed represented\n0.9\n% and\n1.0\n% of life insurance in force at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and reinsurance assumed on life and accident and health products represented\n1.3\n% and\n1.5\n% of premium income for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLeases\n:\nGlobe Life primarily leases office space, aviation equipment, and other equipment under a variety of operating lease arrangements.\nRental expense for the three years ended December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nFuture minimum rental commitments required under operating leases having remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n93\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nPurchase Commitments\n: Globe Life has various long-term noncancelable purchase commitments as well as commitments to provide capital for low-income housing tax credit interests. See further discussion related to tax credits in\n.\nInvestments\n: Globe Life is committed to invest under certain contracts related to investments in limited partnerships. See\nfor unfunded commitment table.\nGuarantees\n:\nAt December 31, 2023, Globe Life had in place\nthree\nguarantee agreements which were either Parent Company guarantees of subsidiary obligations to a third party or Parent Company guarantees of obligations between wholly-owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, Globe Life had\nno\nliability with respect to these guarantees.\nLetters of Credit: Globe Life has guaranteed letters of credit in connection with its credit facility with a group of banks as disclosed in\n. The letters of credit were issued by TMK Re, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, to secure TMK Re, Ltd.’s obligation for claims on certain policies reinsured by TMK Re, Ltd. that were sold by other Globe Life insurance companies. These letters of credit facilitate TMK Re, Ltd.’s ability to reinsure the business of Globe Life's insurance carriers.\nThe agreement was amended on\nSeptember 30, 2021\nand now expires in 2026.\nThe maximum amount of letters of credit available is $\n250\nmillion. The Parent Company would be liable to the extent that TMK Re, Ltd. does not pay the reinsured party. On March 29, 2023, the letters of credit were amended to reduce the current amount outstanding to $\n115\nmillion from $\n125\nmillion outstanding.\nEquipment leases: Globe Life has guaranteed performance of certain of its subsidiaries as lessees under\ntwo\naviation leasing arrangements. At December 31, 2023, total remaining undiscounted payments under the leases were approximately $\n1\nmillion. The Parent Company would be responsible for any subsidiary obligation in the event the subsidiary did not make payments or otherwise perform under the terms of the lease.\nUnclaimed Property Audits\n:\nGlobe Life subsidiaries are currently the subject of audits regarding the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed property arising from life insurance policies and a limited number of annuity contracts. These audits are being conducted by private entities that have contracted with\nforty-seven\nstates through their respective Departments of Revenue, and have not resulted in any financial assessment from any state nor indicated any liability. The audits are wide-ranging and seek large amounts of data regarding claims handling, procedures, and payments of contract benefits arising from unreported death claims. No estimate of range can be made at this time for loss contingencies related to possible administrative penalties or amounts that could be payable to the states for the escheatment of abandoned property.\nLitigation\n: Globe Life Inc. and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including: putative class action litigation; alleged breaches of contract; torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of the Parent Company's insurance subsidiaries; alleged employment discrimination; alleged worker misclassification; and miscellaneous other causes of action. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to the Parent Company and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on Globe Life's financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in the future. This bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts.\n94\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nOn April 4, 2023, putative class action litigation was filed against National Income Life Insurance Company (“National Income”) in New York Supreme Court by plaintiffs Melissa K. Goppert, Sarah Valente, James O’Neill, Jennifer Abe, and Emily Herendeen (“Plaintiffs”) (\nGoppert, et al. v. National Income Life Insurance Company\n, Index No. 153096/2023). Plaintiffs are former National Income independent sales agents who allege they should have been classified as employees and assert claims under New York state law on behalf of a putative class of former independent sales agents and individuals who trained to become independent sale agents since March 2017. Plaintiffs make claims under New York’s Minimum Wage Law (NYLL § 633 and 12 NYCRR § 142-2.1); Overtime Compensation Law (NYLL § 633 and 12 NYCRR § 142-2.2); and “Spread of Hours” Law (12 NYCRR § 142-2.4) for the alleged failure to pay minimum wages and overtime pay, including for time spent in training, and attorney’s fees and costs. National Income filed a motion to compel arbitration of each Plaintiff’s claims on an individual basis, which the Court granted in full on January 11, 2024, and on February 7, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the Court’s order.\nOn September 1, 2023, plaintiff Miné Caglar Cost (“Plaintiff\") filed a complaint against American Income Life Insurance Company (“American Income”) in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, asserting a single claim for violation of the Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) (\nCost v. American Income Life Insurance Company\n,\net al.\n, Case No. 23SMCV04113).\nPlaintiff is a former California independent insurance sales agent who alleges one cause of action for civil penalties under PAGA arising out of alleged violations of the wage-and-hour provisions of the California Labor Code stemming from American Income’s alleged misclassification of Plaintiff and other California-based sales agents as independent contractors. American Income filed a motion to compel arbitration on an individual basis and stay the representative component of Plaintiff’s claims, to which Plaintiff stipulated. On December 12, 2023, the Court approved the parties’ stipulation to compel the matter to individual arbitration and stayed the case pending the completion of the individual arbitration.\n95\nGL 2023

All plan measurements for the pension plans are as of December 31 of the respective year. The pension plans covering the majority of employees are qualified and funded. Contributions are made to funded pension plans subject to minimums required by regulation and maximums allowed for tax purposes.\nGlobe Life's SERP provides an additional supplemental defined pension benefit to a limited number of officers. The supplemental benefit is based on the participant’s qualified plan benefit without consideration to the regulatory limits on compensation and benefit payments applicable to qualified plans, except that eligible compensation is capped at $\n1\nmillion. The SERP is nonqualified and unfunded. However, a Rabbi Trust has been established to support the liability for this plan. The Rabbi Trust consists of life insurance policies on the lives of plan participants with an unaffiliated insurance carrier as well as an investment account. Since this plan is nonqualified, the investments and the policyholder value of the insurance policies in the Rabbi Trust are not included as defined benefit plan assets, but rather assets of the Company.

Globe Life seeks to accomplish these objectives by investing in public and private markets and diversifying across asset classes, industries, sectors and entities. Globe Life intends to maintain an asset mix that when combined with future plan contributions will produce adequate long-term risk adjusted returns relative to expected changes in the liability as a result of changes to interest rates or earned benefits.\nThe majority of the securities in the portfolio are highly marketable so that there will be adequate liquidity to meet projected payments. There are no specific policies calling for asset durations to match those of benefit obligations.\nAllowed investments include equity, fixed income, real assets and short term investments. Equity securities include common stocks or equivalents, preferred stocks, and/or funds investing primarily in private or public equity investments. Fixed income securities include loans of corporations or commercial real estate as well as marketable debt securities issued by either the U.S. Government, Agencies of the U.S. Government, state, local and municipal governments, domestic and foreign corporations, Special Purpose Vehicles secured by pools of financial assets, and other U.S. financial institutions. Real Assets include equity interest in core or non-core real estate or infrastructure with U.S. or non-U.S. exposure. Short-term investments consist of fixed income securities maturing in one year or less.\nThe assets are to be invested in a mix of allowed investments that best serve the objectives of the pension plan. Factors to be considered in determining the asset mix include funded status, annual pension expense, annual pension contributions, and balance sheet liability.

The accumulated benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets were as follows:\nThe following table discloses the assumptions used to determine Globe Life's pension liabilities and costs for the appropriate periods. The discount and compensation increase rates are used to determine current year projected benefit obligations and subsequent year pension expense. The long-term rate of return is used to determine current year expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are included in actuarial gain or loss.\nWeighted Average Pension Plan Assumptions\nThe discount rate is determined based on the expected duration of plan liabilities. A yield is then derived based on the current market yield of a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that match the liability's average life. The rate of compensation increase is projected based on Company experience, modified as appropriate for future expectations. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is management’s best estimate of the average rate of earnings expected to be received on the assets invested in the plan over the benefit period. In determining this assumption, consideration is given to the historical rate of return earned on the assets, the projected returns over future periods, and the discount rate used to compute benefit obligations.\n121\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost:\nNet periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit plans by expense component was as follows:\nAn analysis of the impact on other comprehensive income (loss) concerning pensions and other postretirement benefits is as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes amortization of postretirement benefits other than pensions of $(\n732\n) thousand in 2023, $\n289\nthousand in 2022, and $\n228\nthousand in 2021.\n(2)\nThe increase in the experience gain (loss) is related to an increase discount rate.\n122\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nThe following table presents a reconciliation from the beginning to the end of the year of the PBO for the Pension Plans and SERP, and the plan assets for the Pension Plans.

In addition, other expenses not included in these segments are reported in \"Corporate & Other.\"\nGlobe Life's reportable insurance segments are based on the insurance product lines it markets and administers: life insurance, supplemental health insurance, and annuities. These major product lines are set out as reportable segments because of the common characteristics of products within these categories, comparability of margins, and the similarity in regulatory environment and management techniques. There is also an investment segment that manages the investment portfolio and cash flow for the insurance segments and the corporate function, which has been retrospectively adjusted to exclude the interest on deferred acquisition costs due to the adoption of ASU 2018-12 and the interest on debt. The Company's chief operating decision makers evaluate the overall performance of the operations of the Company in accordance with these segments.\nLife insurance products marketed by Globe Life include traditional whole life and term life insurance. An immaterial amount of annuities sold as companion products are included in the life segment. Health insurance products are generally guaranteed renewable and include Medicare Supplement, cancer, critical illness, accident, and other limited-benefit supplemental hospital and surgical products. Annuities include fixed-benefit contracts.\nThe following tables present segment premium revenue by each of Globe Life's distribution channels.\nPremium Income by Distribution Channel\n133\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nGlobe Life Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nDue to the nature of the life insurance industry, Globe Life has no individual or group which would be considered a major customer. Substantially all of Globe Life's business is conducted in the United States.\nThe measure of profitability established by the chief operating decision makers for the insurance segments is underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses, in accordance with the manner in which the segments are managed. It essentially represents gross profit margin on insurance products before insurance administrative expenses and consists primarily of premium less net policy benefits, acquisition expenses, and commissions. Required interest on policy liabilities is reflected as a component of the Investment segment (rather than as a component of underwriting margin in the insurance and annuity segments) in order to match this cost with the investment income earned on the assets supporting the policy liabilities.\nThe measure of profitability for the Investment segment is excess investment income, representing the income earned on the investment portfolio in excess of policy requirements. During the implementation of ASU 2018-12, the Company reviewed its segment disclosures and modified the measure of profitability of our Investment Segment due to the adoption impact of the standard and to align more appropriately with how we view and measure this segment. As of January 1, 2023, this measure was retrospectively adjusted to exclude the interest on deferred acquisition costs due to the adoption of ASU 2018-12 and the interest expense on debt. Other than the above-mentioned interest allocations, no other intersegment revenues or expenses are recognized. Expenses directly attributable to corporate operations are included in the “Corporate & Other” category. Stock-based compensation expense is considered a corporate expense by Globe Life management and is included in this category. All other unallocated revenues and expenses on a pretax basis, including insurance administrative expense and interest on debt, are also included in the “Corporate & Other” segment category.\nGlobe Life holds a sizable investment portfolio to support its insurance liabilities, the yield from which is used to offset policy benefit, acquisition, administrative, and tax expenses. This yield or investment income is taken into account when establishing premium rates and profitability expectations for its insurance products. From time to time, investments are sold or called, or experience a credit loss event, each of which are reflected by the Company as realized gain (loss)—investments. These gains or losses generally occur as a result of disposition due to issuer calls, compliance with Company investment policies, or other reasons often beyond management’s control. Unlike investment income, realized gains and losses are incidental to insurance operations, and only overall yields are considered when setting premium rates or insurance product profitability expectations. While these gains and losses are not relevant to segment profitability or core operating results, they can have a material positive or negative result on net income. For these reasons, management removes realized investment gains and losses when it views its segment operations.\nManagement also removes non-operating items unrelated to the Company's core insurance activities when evaluating those results. Therefore, these items are excluded in its presentation of segment results because accounting guidance requires that operating segment results be presented as management views its business. With the exception of the administrative settlements, all of these items are included in “Other operating expense” in the\nfor the appropriate year.

As a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting, the Company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in\nInternal Control\n—\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nThere are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.\nManagement evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and based on its assessment, determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein.\nFebruary 28, 2024\n142\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Globe Life Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Globe Life Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nDallas, Texas\nFebruary 28, 2024\n143\nGL 2023 FORM 10-K"
