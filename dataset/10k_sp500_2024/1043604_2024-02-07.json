We believe that our Enterprise customers are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leading-edge applications.\nBusinesses are adopting cloud-based applications and services to avoid infrastructure cost and complexity, increase IT agility, and accelerate digital transformation. We believe that as our Enterprise customers continue to transition their workloads to the cloud, they continue to seek greater flexibility in how they consume networking and security services, such as pay-per-use models. Additionally, Enterprises are deploying AI-driven architectures, which require end-to-end solutions for managing, orchestrating, and securing distributed cloud resources as a single pool of resources. Also, we are increasingly seeing a convergence of networking and security, such as Secure Access Service Edge (\"SASE\"), resulting in security becoming an embedded capability in every solution that we offer to our customers.\nHigh-performance enterprises require IP networks that are global, distributed, and always available. We are innovating in key technology areas to meet the needs of our Enterprise customers whether they plan to move to a public cloud architecture or hybrid cloud architecture (which is a mix of public and private cloud, as well as a growing number of SaaS applications).\nCloud\nOur Cloud vertical includes companies that are heavily reliant on the cloud for their business model’s success. Customers in the Cloud vertical can include cloud service providers, such as the largest public cloud providers, which we refer to as hyperscalers, and Tier-2 cloud providers, which we refer to as cloud majors, as well as enterprises that provide SaaS, infrastructure-as-a-service, or platform-as-a-service.\nCloud providers continue to grow as more organizations take advantage of public infrastructure to run their businesses. As their businesses grow, we expect they will continue to invest in their networks, which dictate the quality and experience of the products and the services they deliver to their end customers. Further, as cloud providers adopt new technologies, including the 400-gigabit Ethernet, or 400GbE, and in anticipation of the future adoption of 800-gigabit Ethernet, or 800GbE, and beyond, we believe this should present further opportunities for us across our portfolio as our cloud customers value high-performance, highly compact, power-efficient infrastructures, which we support and continue to develop.\nIn addition, SaaS continues to be an important factor for cloud providers as their customers, such as enterprises, prefer to procure and consume product and service offerings via SaaS models. As a result, we believe that SaaS providers will invest in high-performance infrastructure because the quality of experience has proven just as important competitively as software features and functions. Lastly, as a result of regulations and the need for lower latency and high-performance networking, cloud providers have been transitioning to regional network build-outs or distributed cloud environments to address the increasing demand for services, data privacy, data protection, and consumer rights.\nAs Cloud customers are pushing the envelope in networking, our focus on collaboration combined with networking innovation around automation has made us a strategic partner with these customers, helping them develop high-performance and lower total cost of ownership networking solutions to support their business.\nService Provider\nOur Service Provider vertical includes wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators, and we support most of the major carrier and operator networks in the world with our high-performance network infrastructure offerings. In recent years, we have seen increased convergence of these different types of customers through acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships.\n12\nService Provider customers recognize the need for high-performance networks and leveraging the cloud to reduce costs from their network operations. This is dictating a change in business models and their underlying infrastructure, which we believe requires investment in the build-out of high-performance networks and the transformation of existing legacy infrastructure to distributed cloud environments in order to satisfy the growth in mobile traffic and video as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including smartphones, tablets, and connected devices of various kinds.\nWe expect that Network Function Virtualization and SDN will be critical elements to enable our Service Provider customers the flexibility to support enhanced mobile video and dynamic new service deployments. We are engaging with these customers to transition their operations to next-generation cloud operations as the need for a highly efficient infrastructure to handle large amounts of data along with low latency, or minimal delay, plays into the need to have a high performance, scalable infrastructure in combination with the automation and flexibility required to drive down operational costs and rapid provision applications. We consistently deliver leading technologies that transform the economics and experience of networking while significantly improving customer economics by lowering the capital expenditures required to build networks and the operating expenses required to manage and maintain them.\nIn addition to reducing operating costs, service providers are seeking to create new or additional revenue opportunities to support their evolving business models. These customers are deploying 5G, which we expect will continue to roll out over the next few years, and IoT, which we believe will give rise to new services like connected cars, smart cities, robotic manufacturing, and agricultural transformation. 5G and IoT require a highly distributed cloud data center architecture from which services are delivered to the end users and will involve a great degree of analytics and embedded security. We expect this trend will present further opportunities for Juniper with our focus on delivering a strong portfolio of network virtualization and software-based orchestration solutions, which position us to deliver on the automation and agility requirements of service providers.\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nResearch and Development\nWe have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of high-end computing, network system design, ASIC design, security, routing protocols, software applications and platforms, and embedded operating systems. As of December 31, 2023, we employed 4,310 people in our worldwide research and development, or R&D, organization.\nWe believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology, developing additional applications, integrating that technology, and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings.

Our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production, including activities such as material procurement, surface mount assembly, final assembly, test, control, shipment to our customers, and repairs. Together with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers, we design, specify, and monitor the tests that are required to ensure that our products meet internal and external quality standards. We believe that these arrangements provide us with the following benefits:\n•\nWe can quickly ramp up and deliver products to customers with turnkey manufacturing;\n•\nWe operate with a minimum amount of dedicated space and employees for manufacturing operations; and\n14\n•\nWe can reduce our costs by reducing what would normally be fixed overhead expenses.\nOur contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts. Our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components used in our products. Once the components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast are procured, our manufacturing partners assemble and test the products according to agreed-upon specifications. Products are then shipped to our distributors, resellers, or end-customers. To address supply-chain challenges, including increases in component costs during and following the COVID-19 pandemic and global component shortages, we have taken specific additional procurement actions, including strategic purchases of raw materials and components for the production of finished goods. As a result, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, additional holding costs and obsolescence charges as we continue to face uncertainties in future product demand for certain products. Title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the contract manufacturer's or original design manufacturer's location. Customers take title to the products upon delivery at a specified destination. If the product or components remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period, we may incur carrying charges or charges for excess or obsolete materials.\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer, as applicable, may accept purchase orders from us. These contracts do not represent long-term commitments.\nSome of our custom components, such as ASICs and communication integrated circuits, are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources, each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs. To ensure the security and integrity of Juniper products during manufacture, assembly and distribution, we have implemented a supply chain risk management framework as part of our overall Supply Chain Security and Risk Management Programs. This framework encompasses all aspects of the supply chain as well as enhanced elements specific to security issues applicable to Juniper products and our customers.\nBy working collaboratively with our suppliers and as members of coalitions such as the Responsible Business Alliance (\"RBA\"), Responsible Minerals Initiative, and the CDP Supply Chain program, we endeavor to promote socially and environmentally responsible business practices beyond our company and throughout our worldwide supply chain. To this end, we have adopted a business partner code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers. Our business partner code of conduct expresses support for and is aligned with the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the RBA Code of Conduct. The RBA, a coalition of electronics, retail, auto and toy companies, provides guidelines and resources to drive performance and compliance with critical corporate social responsibility policies. Its goals are to promote ethical business practices, to ensure that working conditions in the electronic industry supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible. By using standard audit and assessment protocols and tools, we measure and monitor manufacturing partners’ top direct material suppliers’, and select indirect suppliers’ compliance with the RBA Code of Conduct and applicable environmental, health and safety, labor and ethics legal requirements. Our complementary efforts include an annual supplier sustainability attestation to have current agreements with suppliers to observe key requirements; communicating requirements that suppliers report to CDP climate change and water; due diligence on labor rights concerns through direct observance of supply chain practices and third-party risk tools; and conflict minerals surveying and remediation actions for suppliers.\nBacklog\nOur sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under master sales agreements either with our distributors, resellers, or end-customers. At any given time, we have a backlog of orders for products that have not shipped. Because certain orders are cancellable or delivery schedules may be changed, we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our total product backlog was approximately $569 million and $2,019 million, respectively. Our product backlog consists of purchase orders for products expected to be shipped to our distributors, resellers, or end-customers within the subsequent twelve months, which primarily reflected the ongoing impact of supply chain constraints in 2022, that have diminished in 2023. The following amounts are not included in our backlog: (1) deferred revenue, (2) unbilled contract revenue, (3) all service obligations, including SaaS, and (4) certain future revenue adjustments for items such as sales return reserves and early payment discounts.\nFor further discussion on the risks and uncertainties related to backlog, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Report.\n15\nSeasonality\nWe, as do many companies in our industry, experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns. Historically, we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter of the fiscal year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance. The ongoing global component shortage and extended lead times and their impacts on our ability to ship products to our customers in a timely manner may disrupt our typical seasonal trends.\nCompetition\nWe compete in the network infrastructure markets. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to solutions that combine high performance networking with cloud technologies. In the network infrastructure business, Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, has historically been the dominant player. Our principal competitors also include Arista Networks, Inc.; Ciena Corporation; Extreme Networks; Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., or HPE; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., or Huawei; Fortinet, Inc.; Nokia Corporation, or Nokia; and NVIDIA Corporation.\nMany of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco, Nokia, HPE, and Huawei, among others, have broader portfolios which enable them to bundle their networking products with other networking and information technology products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, marketing budgets, and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, negatively affecting our operating results.\nIn addition, there are a number of other competitors in the security network infrastructure space, including Cisco, Huawei, Nokia, Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd., Fortinet, Inc., Zscaler, Inc., Netskope, Inc., and Forcepoint LLC, among others, who tend to be focused specifically on security solutions and, therefore, may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line.\nWe expect that over time, large companies with significant resources, technical expertise, market experience, customer relationships, and broad product lines, such as Cisco, Nokia, and Huawei, will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market. There are also several other companies that aim to build products with greater capabilities to compete with our products. Further, there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry, with smaller companies being acquired by larger, established suppliers of network infrastructure products. We believe this trend is likely to continue, which may increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios.\nIn addition to established competitors, a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior and cost effective in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers.\nAs a result, we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have and also from emerging companies that are developing new technologies. Although we believe that our technology and the purpose-built features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies, there can be no assurance that new products, enhancements, or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance.\nMaterial Government Regulations\nOur business activities are worldwide and subject us to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws in the countries in which we operate, and our products and services are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products. To date, costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations have not been material to our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future governmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products, or services will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations. Nonetheless, as discussed below, we believe that environmental, social, and global trade regulations could potentially have a material impact on our business.\n16\nEnvironment and Social\nWe are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products, and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain. Our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment, such as the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE); Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS); Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH); and the U.S.'s Toxic Substances Control Act. Recently enacted regulations, such as the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and California’s Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, also apply to Juniper.\nJuniper’s greatest impact on the environment is through our products and services. We focus on circular economy principles, including designing products with sustainability in mind to make them more efficient, reliable, and long-lasting. We also select manufacturers, suppliers, and business partners who share our values and commitment to environmental sustainability. Our products are built for flexibility, interoperability, and scalability, which we believe contribute to long-term customer value. The modular design of our products allows for efficient servicing such as dismantling and repairing instead of wholesale discarding. The Juniper Certified Pre-Owned Program allows our customers to contribute to sustainability by purchasing refurbished hardware. Our product design and services encourage customers to reuse and recycle products and parts to extend the life of materials. In sum, our efforts help reduce e-waste in landfills and build a circular economy.\nWe also voluntarily participate in the annual CDP climate change and water security disclosures and encourage our suppliers to do the same. Additionally, we are a signatory supporter of the United Nations Global Compact, and have adopted and promote the adoption by our suppliers of the RBA Code of Conduct, as discussed above in the section entitled\nManufacturing and Operations\n. We continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to execute on, monitor, and drive environmental improvements in our global operations and within our supply chain.\nWe are likewise committed to all human rights and labor rights laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products, and services. We have zero tolerance for human rights or labor abuses and have management systems in place that help us to detect and investigate such concerns. Notable human rights and labor rights regulations we are subject to include the U.S.’s Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act and Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act; the UK Modern Slavery Act; and the Australian Modern Slavery Act.\nGlobal Trade\nAs a global company, the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties, U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, and local trade rules around the world. The scope, nature, and severity of such controls varies widely across different countries and may change frequently over time. Such laws, rules, and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals, or by requiring us to comply with domestic preference programs, laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology or source code, unique technical standards, localization mandates, and duplicative in-country testing and inspection requirements. In particular, the U.S. and other governments have imposed restrictions on the import and export of, among other things, certain telecommunications products and components, particularly those that contain or use encryption technology. Most of our products are telecommunications products and contain or use encryption technology and, consequently, are subject to restrictions. The consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally. We continue to support open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated cross-border supply chains that are expected to continue to contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements.\nFor additional information concerning regulatory compliance and a discussion of the risks associated with governmental regulations that may materially impact us, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Report.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise, as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights. While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark law, as well as confidentiality agreements, to protect our technology, we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology.\n17\nPatents\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had over 6,015 patents worldwide and numerous patent applications are pending. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms on the individual patents vary. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed, that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights.\nLicenses\nIn addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products and, from time to time, we need to renegotiate these licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models. There can be no assurance that third-party licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTrademarks\nJUNIPER NETWORKS, JUNIPER, the Juniper Networks logo, JUNOS, and other trademarks are registered trademarks of Juniper Networks, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the United States and other countries. Other names may be trademarks of their respective owners.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe our success in delivering high-performance networks in the digital transformation era relies on our culture, values, and the creativity and commitment of our people. As of December 31, 2023, we had 11,144 employees, of whom approximately 44%, 43%, and 13% resided in the Americas, APAC, and EMEA, respectively. We invest in our people. We strive to maintain healthy, safe, and secure working conditions - a workplace where our employees are treated with respect and dignity. Our vision is to create an inclusive, diverse, and authentic community that inspires collaboration, integrity, engagement, and innovation. We are striving to create a world-class employee experience, one that offers opportunity for personal and professional growth, and enables work-life flexibility that aligns with the core values embodied in the Juniper Way.\nIn 2023, Juniper was recognized as a Great Place to Work in the United States, India, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Juniper was also recognized as one the Fortune's Most Admired Companies and Ethisphere's World’s Most Ethical Companies.\nOur Values: The Juniper Way\nOur mission is to make every connection count. We seek to be a responsible global citizen and influence meaningful differences in the world around us. We believe that connections will bring us closer together while empowering us all to solve some of the world’s greatest challenges of health and well-being, sustainability, and equity.\nTo deliver our mission, we rely on a committed and consistent practice that we call the Juniper Way. More than a set of shared values, the Juniper Way reflects the company’s commitment to inspire Juniper employees to do their best work. This foundation is embodied in three values – Be Bold, Build Trust, and Deliver Excellence - along with a set of refined behaviors for each.\nInclusion and Diversity\nAs a company, we are committed to inclusion and diversity of employees with many backgrounds, experiences, and identities. We believe that inclusion and diversity are competitive assets that drive positive change to our company and communities. At our core, we believe excellence depends on seeking out diverse ideas and fostering a culture where all employees belong. We aim to lead with vision and empathy, promoting understanding and awareness across our workforce, and we are committed to improving inclusivity by being engaged and accountable at the highest level of leadership.\n18\nIn 2023, we continued to make progress in our inclusion and diversity efforts. We continued our global sponsorship and leadership development programs, which aim to empower the next generation of leaders, and we continued our Affinity Groups, employee-led groups that emphasize the connection among employees from similar backgrounds and their allies, and which provide professional development, sense of belonging, and career connections. We also launched a global allyship program with meaningful discussions about under-represented groups’ experiences and what part we can all play to make Juniper more inclusive.\nEmployee Engagement and Development\nWe use a framework called Talent Matters to encourage an open and interactive culture between employees and their managers, where individual needs are recognized and met, and company goals are supported. Our professional development approach includes reviewing and assessing our management teams as well as facilitating personal employee development and growth. For employees, growth goals are tied to our corporate objectives and key results to ensure that employees are progressing and are supported by management teams. In 2023, we continued our People Manager Network to provide global consistency in how managers lead teams and support employees. With this program, managers are empowered and provided with the training and resources to scale employee career growth and provide their teams with the necessary tools to facilitate that growth. Managers are encouraged to schedule Conversation Days with their direct reports to identify opportunities for the company to better support employees and set goals for professional and personal growth.\nTo ensure our employees’ personal and professional growth, we continue to provide training courses focused on building personal capabilities as well as skill development. In 2023, we launched Junivator Career Connect (\"JCC\"), a new people-centered, internal talent marketplace. Defining Juniper’s approach to skills-based workplace transformation, JCC supports our employees’ futures by helping them create customized learning journeys, explore career pathways, connect with mentors, apply for internal openings, and experiment with internal gig work. Also, in response to employee feedback, we maintain LinkedIn Learning for all employees, offering online courses on business, technology, and creative skills. Additionally, each year, Juniper employees receive role-specific trainings, which include topics such as human rights, environmental performance, compliance with the Juniper Worldwide Code of Business Conduct, engineering, information security, and other compliance and industry-specific subjects.\nWe consistently work to improve the employee experience by addressing feedback collected through the annual Juniper Voice Survey and topic-specific surveys, including employee benefits and total rewards packages.\n19\nEmployee Retention, Benefits, and Wellness\nWe continue to prioritize our commitment to retaining and attracting a diverse workforce with the skills needed to deliver Experience-First Networking. We aim to provide benefits and programs that are holistic, flexible, and inclusive. We are committed to pay equity and benefits innovation. From offering childcare and working mother support, to expanding medical coverage for infertility and gender-affirming procedures, to foster and adoptive parent assistance, we have provided benefit offerings that are intended to be as inclusive and diverse as our employees’ needs.\nOur community engagement program empowers employees to participate authentically, so they can make an impact where it matters most to them. We offer five paid working days per year for employees to give back to their communities and engage with causes of their choice. In 2023, we continued our Global Week of Giving, encouraging employees to volunteer with a project curated by Juniper or with an organization in their own communities.\nThe health, safety, and well-being of our employees are vital to Juniper's success. In recognition of the value our employees bring to our success and to aid our employees to maintain a balanced state of overall wellness and success, we provide quarterly Wellness Days, a day when all Juniper employees take the same day off from work to relax and recharge. Our employees also have unlimited access to the TaskHuman platform, a virtual wellness coaching application, which covers hundreds of wellness topics from yoga and nutrition to financial guidance.\nInformation about our Executive Officers and Key Employees\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers and key employees as of the filing of this Report:\nRAMI RAHIM\njoined Juniper in January 1997 and became Chief Executive Officer of Juniper and a member of the Board of Directors in November 2014.

    "text": "RISK FACTOR SUMMARY\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to the Merger\n•\nThe announcement of our entry into the Merger Agreement and pendency of the Merger may result in disruptions to our business, and the Merger could divert management's attention, disrupt our relationships with third parties and employees, and result in negative publicity, customer concerns, or legal proceedings, any of which could negatively impact our operating results and ongoing business.\n•\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to the conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, including receipt of regulatory approvals, which may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that cannot be met, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not be completed.\n•\nLitigation may arise in connection with the Merger, which could be costly, prevent or delay consummation of the Merger, divert management’s attention, and otherwise materially harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy and Industry\n•\nOur quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations; as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors.\n•\nWe expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time.\n•\nOur backlog may not be an accurate indicator of our level and timing of future revenues.\n•\nWe derive a material portion of our revenues from a limited number of our customers.\n•\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our business and financial results could be harmed.\n•\nFluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results.\n•\nOur success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and scale and restructure our business.\n•\nOur acquisitions or divestitures of businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price, and equity issued as consideration for acquisitions may dilute the ownership of our stockholders.\n•\nLong sales and implementation cycles for our products and customer urgency related to ship dates to fill large orders may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.\n•\nOur ability to recognize revenue in a particular period is contingent on the timing of product orders and deliveries and/or our sales of certain software, subscriptions, and professional support and maintenance services.\nRisks Related to Our Technology and Business Operations\n•\nIf the demand for network and IP systems does not continue to grow, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n•\nIssues in the development and use of artificial intelligence may result in reputational harm or liability.\n•\nIf we do not anticipate technological shifts, market needs and opportunities, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.\n•\nOur strategy to expand our software business could adversely affect our competitive position.\n•\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business.\n•\nOur products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party technology.\n•\nWe may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights, which could adversely affect our ability to compete.\n•\nWe depend on contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers as well as single-source and limited source suppliers, including for key components such as semiconductors.\n•\nWe face significant risks to our business and operations due to political and economic tensions between China and Taiwan.\n•\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, and cyberattacks could compromise our and our customers’ proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations, and harm public perception of our products.\n•\nDisruption in our distribution channels could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\n•\nWe rely on the performance of our business systems and third-party systems and processes.\n•\nOur ability to develop, market, and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel.\n•\nOur business could be negatively impacted by oversight of ESG matters and/or our reporting of ESG matters.\n22\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\n•\nWe are a party to lawsuits, investigations, and other disputes.\n•\nNon-standard contract terms with telecommunications, cable, and cloud service provider companies, and other large customers, including large enterprise customers, could have an adverse effect on our business or impact the amount of revenues to be recognized.\n•\nRegulations of our industry or of our customers could harm our operating results and future prospects.\n•\nGovernmental regulations, economic sanctions and other legal restrictions that affect international trade or affect movement and disposition of our products and component parts could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.\n•\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\n•\nOur financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets.\n•\nChanges in effective tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.\n•\nWe are subject to risks arising from our international operations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n•\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.\n•\nOur investments are subject to risks, which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n•\nFailing to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes, or any weaknesses in our internal controls may adversely affect investor perception, and our stock price.\n•\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum.\nFactors That May Affect Future Results\nWe operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Some of these risks are highlighted in the following discussion, and in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Investors should carefully consider all relevant risks before investing in our securities. The occurrence of any of these risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER\nThe announcement of our entry into the Merger Agreement and pendency of the Merger may result in disruptions to our business, and the Merger could divert management's attention, disrupt our relationships with third parties and employees, and result in negative publicity, customer concerns, or legal proceedings, any of which could negatively impact our operating results and ongoing business.\nOn January 9, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with HPE and Merger Sub, providing for the acquisition of Juniper by HPE. Completion of the Merger, which is currently expected in late calendar year 2024 or early calendar year 2025, is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including: (1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, (2) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and certain other approvals, clearances or expirations of waiting periods under other antitrust laws and foreign investment laws, (3) the absence of any order, injunction, or other order or law prohibiting the Merger or making the closing of the Merger illegal, (4) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties, subject to certain standards set forth in the Merger Agreement, (5) the performance and compliance in all material respects of each party’s agreements and covenants under the Merger Agreement, and (6) in the case of the obligations of HPE and Merger Sub to effect the Merger, no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) with respect to Juniper, having occurred and that is continuing as of the closing. There is no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived, or that the Merger will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all. Furthermore, there are additional inherent risks in the Merger, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed below.\n23\nDuring the period prior to the closing of the Merger, our business is exposed to certain inherent risks due to the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on our business relationships, financial condition, operating results, and business, including:\n•\npotential uncertainty in the marketplace, which could result in current and prospective customers, resellers, and distributors to purchase products and services from our competitors or reduce, delay or cancel purchasing from us;\n•\nthe possibility of disruption to our business and operations, including diversion of management attention and resources;\n•\nthe inability to attract and retain key personnel (including as a result of solicitation by our competitors or others), and the possibility that our current employees could be distracted, and their productivity decline as a result, due to uncertainty regarding the Merger;\n•\nthe inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make changes to our business and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, pending the completion of the Merger;\n•\nour inability to solicit other acquisition proposals during the pendency of the Merger;\n•\nthe amount of the costs, fees, expenses, and charges related to the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and\n•\nother developments beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in domestic or global economic or political conditions that may affect the timing or success of the Merger.\nThe Merger may be delayed, and may ultimately not be completed, due to a number of factors, including:\n•\nthe failure to obtain the approval of the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders;\n•\nthe failure to obtain regulatory approvals from certain governmental entities (or the imposition of any conditions, limitations or restrictions on such approvals);\n•\npotential future stockholder litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could delay or prevent the Merger; and\n•\nthe failure to satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the Merger, including the possibility that a continuing Material Adverse Effect on our business would permit HPE not to close the Merger.\nIf the Merger does not close, our business and stockholders would be exposed to additional risks, including:\n•\nto the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed, the price of our common stock could decrease if the Merger is not completed;\n•\ninvestor confidence could decline, stockholder litigation could be brought against us, relationships with existing and prospective customers, resellers, distributors, manufacturers, service providers, investors, lenders, and other business partners may be adversely impacted, we may be unable to hire or retain key personnel, and profitability may be adversely impacted due to costs incurred in connection with the pending Merger;\n•\nthe requirement that we pay a customary termination fee of $407.5 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including by us in order to accept a superior proposal or by HPE because the Board of Directors of Juniper withdraws its recommendation in favor of the Merger.\nEven if successfully completed, there are certain additional risks to our stockholders from the Merger, including:\n•\nthe amount of cash to be paid under the Merger Agreement is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition, or operating results or in the event of any change in the market price of, analyst estimates of, or projections relating to, our common stock;\n24\n•\nthe fact that receipt of the all-cash per share merger consideration under the Merger Agreement is taxable to stockholders that are treated as U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and\n•\nthe fact that, if the Merger is completed, our stockholders will forego the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful execution of our current strategy as an independent company, and will be affected by the ability of HPE to integrate and implement its plans, forecasts and other expectations with respect to our business and realize additional opportunities for growth and innovation.\nAny of the foregoing, individually or in combination, could materially and adversely affect our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations and prospects.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to the conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, including receipt of regulatory approvals, which may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that cannot be met, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not be completed.\nBefore the Merger may be completed, various consents, clearances, approvals, authorizations and declarations of non-objection, or expiration of waiting periods (or extensions thereof), must be obtained from certain regulatory and governmental authorities in the U.S., in the European Union, and in numerous other jurisdictions. In addition, the Merger may be reviewed under antitrust statutes or foreign direct investment regimes of other governmental authorities.\nIn deciding whether to grant the required regulatory approval, consent or clearance, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effects of the Merger on competition within their relevant jurisdiction. Regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on their respective approvals, in which case lengthy negotiations may ensue among such regulatory or governmental entities, HPE and us. Such conditions, any such negotiations and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or preventing consummation of the Merger.\nSubject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, as soon as reasonably practicable; provided, however, HPE is not required, and we are not permitted, to take any action that would result in a Burdensome Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Satisfaction of many of the closing conditions is not within our control. For example, we cannot be certain that required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all, or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of regulatory remedies on the completion of the Merger.\nIf any of the closing conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to January 9, 2025, which deadline may be automatically extended to October 9, 2025, under certain circumstances, it is possible that the Merger Agreement will be terminated.\nLitigation may arise in connection with the Merger, which could be costly, prevent or delay consummation of the Merger, divert management’s attention, and otherwise materially harm our business.\nIt is possible that litigation against us or our directors may be filed in the future as securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition, merger, or other business combination agreements like the Merger Agreement. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain, and any litigation related to the Merger could delay or prevent the consummation of the proposed Merger.\nRegardless of the outcome of any future litigation related to the Merger, such litigation may be time-consuming and expensive and may distract our management from running the day-to-day operations of our business. The litigation costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources to address the claims and counterclaims in any litigation related to the Merger may materially negatively impact our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, and financial condition. If the Merger is not consummated for any reason, litigation could be filed in connection with the failure to consummate the Merger. Any litigation related to the Merger may result in negative publicity or an unfavorable impression of us, which could negatively affect the price of our common stock, impair our ability to recruit or retain employees, damage our relationships with our customers, resellers, distributors, and other business partners, or otherwise materially harm our operations and financial performance.\nFurther, one of the conditions to the completion of the Merger is that no restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction will be in effect which prevents the consummation of the Merger. As such, if any such order or injunction preventing the consummation of the Merger is obtained, that order or injunction may prevent the proposed Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.\n25\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND INDUSTRY\nOur quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations; as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors.\nOur revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of our securities could be negatively affected. Our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance.\nFactors associated with our industry, the operation of our business, and the markets for our products and services that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate, include, but are not limited to:\n•\nunpredictable ordering patterns and limited visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue;\n•\nchanges in our customer mix, the mix of products and services sold, and the geographies in which our products and services are sold;\n•\nchanges in the demand for our products and services, including seasonal fluctuations in customer spending;\n•\nchanging market and economic conditions, including rising interest rates, recessionary cycles, and inflationary pressures, that could make our solutions more expensive or could increase our costs for materials, supplies, and services;\n•\nability to fulfill orders received in a timely manner due to disruptions and shortages in our global supply chain;\n•\nchanges in ordering patterns from increased advance ordering by customers of our products due to industry-wide supply chain concerns and our increased lead times, followed by decreased ordering by our customers as they consume advance orders as supply normalizes;\n•\nprice and product competition;\n•\nineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n•\nhow well we execute on our strategy and business model;\n•\nfinancial stability of our customers, including the solvency of private sector customers, and the impact of adverse developments affecting the financial services industry;\n•\nexecutive orders, tariffs, governmental sanctions, changes in laws or regulations and accounting rules, or interpretations thereof;\n•\nthe impact of a U.S federal government shutdown or sovereign debt default on the U.S. economy, capital markets, our customers, our suppliers, and our business, including any adverse effects due to limited federal government services, such as import and export clearance, or visa processing;\n•\nregional economic and political conditions, which may be aggravated by unanticipated global events; and\n•\ndisruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by, among other things, terrorism or other intentional acts, armed conflicts (such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as governmental sanctions imposed in response, the Israel-Hamas war, and conflicts related to the attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea), cyberwarfare, an escalation of political tensions, outbreaks of disease, including global health emergencies and pandemics, earthquakes, floods, fires, or other natural disasters, including catastrophic events, and other unanticipated extraordinary externalities, including extreme weather conditions due to climate change that increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters and may cause derivative disruptions such as impacts to our physical infrastructure or those of our customers, manufacturers, and suppliers.\nWe believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be. In some prior periods, our operating results have been below our guidance, our long-term financial model, or the expectations of securities analysts or investors. This may happen again, and the price of our common stock may decline. In addition, our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time.\nOur product and service gross margins are expected to vary, and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors, including, but not limited to, customer, vertical, product and geographic mix shifts, an increase or decrease in our software sales or the services we provide, increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete, modifications to our pricing strategy to gain or retain footprint in markets or with customers, currency fluctuations that impact our costs or the cost of our products and services to our customers, inflation, increases in material, labor, logistics, warranty costs, or inventory carrying costs, excess product component or obsolescence charges, issues with manufacturing or component availability, issues relating to the distribution of our products and provision of our services, quality or efficiencies, increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inaccurately forecasting product demand, warranty related issues, the impact of tariffs, or our introduction of new products and enhancements, or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures. We have seen, and may continue to see, our gross margins negatively impacted by increases in component costs, logistics costs, elevated inventory\n26\nbalances, and inflationary pressures. Failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nOur backlog may not be an accurate indicator of our level and timing of future revenues.\nOur backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results. For example, as a result of product order volume growth in prior periods and industry-wide supply challenges due to both constrained manufacturing capacity as well as shortages of component parts, our backlog grew significantly in 2021 and 2022 and remained elevated throughout 2023.  As customer buying patterns normalize, order growth declines, and supply chain conditions improve, we expect our backlog to reduce to approximate historical levels. Further, customer behaviors have been changing as a result of worldwide macroeconomic factors, which has reduced demand and may continue to reduce demand for certain of our products and services. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of these and other events effectively, or if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy or the industries in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe derive a material portion of our revenues from a limited number of our customers.\nA material portion of our net revenues, across each customer vertical, depends on sales to a limited number of customers. The concentration of our customer base increases risks related to the financial condition of our customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. If any such customers change their business requirements or focus, vendor selection, project prioritization, or purchasing behavior, or are parties to consolidation transactions, they may delay, suspend, reduce, or cancel their purchases of our products or services and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, major customers may also seek more favorable pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us, which may have a negative impact on our business, cash flow, revenue, and gross margins.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our business and financial results could be harmed.\nThe markets that we serve are rapidly evolving and highly competitive and include several well-established companies. We also compete with other companies that are developing technologies that compete with our products. In addition, actual or speculated consolidation among competitors, or the acquisition by, or of, our partners and/or resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all. Our partners and resellers generally sell competing products on a non-exclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete, which could also adversely affect our business. Several of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range or greater depth of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do. Other competitors have become more integrated, including through consolidation and vertical integration, and offer a broader range of products and services, which could make their solutions more attractive to our customers. Many of our competitors also sell networking products as bundled solutions with other IT products. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could experience a loss in market share and a reduction in revenues and/or be required to reduce prices, which could reduce our gross margins and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results.\nOur revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness or uncertainty, customer financial difficulties, and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have resulted in, and may in the future result in, decreased revenues and earnings. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers, manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses, and to make decisions about future investments. In addition, economic instability or uncertainty, inflationary pressures, continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other events beyond our control, such as the remaining effects of global health emergencies, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the Israel-Hamas war, have, and may continue to, put pressure on economic conditions, including global and regional financial markets, which has led and could lead, to reduced demand for our products, delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects, and/or higher costs of production. Future or continued economic weakness, failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness, customer financial difficulties, increases in costs of production, and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and scale and restructure our business.\nOur ability to successfully offer our products and services and execute on our growth strategy in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in a cost-effective manner. From time to time, we have increased investment in our business by increasing headcount, acquiring companies, and increasing our investment in research and development, sales and marketing, and other\n27\nparts of our business. Conversely, from time to time, we have initiated restructuring plans to realign our workforce as a result of organizational and leadership changes, which resulted in restructuring charges. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives is subject to many estimates and assumptions, which are subject to uncertainties. If our estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, if we cannot evolve and scale our business and operations effectively, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur acquisitions or divestitures of businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price, and equity issued as consideration for acquisitions may dilute the ownership of our stockholders.\nWe have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions to enhance our business and invest significant resources to integrate the businesses we acquire. The success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize business opportunities and manage risks, including, but not limited to: problems combining the purchased business operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs, higher operating expenses, liabilities, litigation, diversion of management's time and attention, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains, failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities, or other challenges of an acquired company or technology, including risks that arise due to incomplete assimilation of acquired companies' information systems and use by acquired companies of technology managed outside the scope of our information technology organization resulting in incomplete coverage by our cybersecurity threat risk management tools, and the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors, and other business partners of the companies we acquire.\nAcquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to uncertainties, including many factors outside of our control. As a result, our previous or future acquisitions may not be successful. We may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we acquire or the transaction may not advance our business strategy as expected. Further, we may not realize anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions. In addition, we have divested, and may in the future divest, businesses, product lines, or assets. These transactions may also require significant separation activities that could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention, loss of employees, substantial separation costs, and accounting charges for asset impairments. Any acquisitions or divestitures may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to issue common stock, or assume equity awards, which would dilute the ownership of our current stockholders; use a substantial portion of our cash resources; assume liabilities (both known and unknown); incur tax expenses; record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets as well as restructuring and other related expenses. We may incur additional acquisition-related debt, which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs, thereby limiting our ability to borrow. Any of the foregoing factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses, product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions.\nLong sales and implementation cycles for our products and customer urgency related to ship dates to fill large orders may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.\nWe experience lengthy sales cycles because our customers' decisions to purchase certain of our products, particularly new products, involve a significant commitment of their resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. Customers design and implement large network deployments following lengthy procurement processes, which may impact expected future orders. Following a purchase, customers may also deploy our products slowly and deliberately. Customers with large networks often expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis and place large orders on an irregular basis. These sales and implementation cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will place large orders with urgent ship dates, may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.\nOur ability to recognize revenue in a particular period is contingent on the timing of product orders and deliveries and/or our sales of certain software, subscriptions, and professional support and maintenance services.\nIn some of our businesses, our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. Further, we build certain products only when orders are received. Since the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter remains unpredictable, if orders for custom products are received late in any quarter, we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period or meet our expected quarterly revenues. Similarly, if we were to take actions or events occur which encourage customers to place orders or accept deliveries earlier than anticipated, our ability to meet our expected revenues in future quarters could be adversely affected. We also determine our operating expenses based on our anticipated revenues and technology roadmap and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term. Any failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter-to-quarter.\n28\nIn addition, services revenue, including SaaS revenue, accounts for a significant portion of our revenue, comprising 35%, 33%, and 35% of total revenue in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We expect our sales of new or renewal professional services, support, maintenance, and SaaS contracts to fluctuate due to end-customers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services, the prices of our products and services or those offered by our competitors, and reductions in our end-customers’ spending levels. We recognize professional services when delivered, and we recognize support, maintenance, and SaaS revenue periodically over the term of the relevant service period.\nFurther, we recognize certain software revenues periodically over the term of the relevant use or subscription periods and as a result, the related software and support and maintenance revenue we report each fiscal quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue from contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Any fluctuation in such new or renewed contracts in any one fiscal quarter may not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue and could negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nIf the demand for network and IP systems does not continue to grow, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure IP infrastructure as well as customers that depend on the continued growth of IP services to deploy our products in their networks and IP infrastructures. As a result of changes in the economy, capital spending, or the building of network capacity in excess of demand (all of which have, in the past, particularly affected telecommunications service providers), spending on IP infrastructure can vary, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a number of our existing customers are evaluating the build-out of their next generation networks. During the decision-making period when our customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the software and equipment they will use in those networks, such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure IP infrastructure. Any reduction or suspension of spending on IP infrastructure is difficult to predict, and may be due to events beyond our control. This, in turn, can make it more difficult to accurately predict revenues from customers, can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by customers and, even where our products are ultimately selected, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIssues in the development and use of artificial intelligence may result in reputational harm or liability.\nWe incorporate AI capabilities into certain of our offerings, and this technology is a significant element of our business. As with many developing technologies, AI presents risks and challenges, and may result in unintended consequences that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. Deficiencies or other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, penalties, legal liability, or brand or reputational harm. AI is an emerging technology for which the legal and regulatory landscape is not fully developed, including potential liability for breaching intellectual property or privacy regulations. While laws and regulations applicable to AI are emerging and evolving, including the EU’s provisional AI Act, what these legal frameworks will look like remains uncertain and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these legal frameworks, and our obligation to comply with them could entail significant costs, negatively affect our business, or entirely limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings.\nAdditionally, leveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve internal functions and operations presents further risks, costs, and challenges. We aim to use AI ethically and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical or legal issues presented by its use. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving ethical or legal issues presented by the use of AI. The use of AI to support business operations may carry inherent risks related to data privacy and security, such as intended or unintended transmission of personal data or proprietary or sensitive information, as well as challenges related to implementing and maintaining AI tools. Increased use of AI by third parties may also increase these risks. Further, reliance on AI could introduce operational vulnerabilities and impact our relationships with customers, partners, and suppliers.\nIf we do not anticipate technological shifts, market needs and opportunities, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.\nIf we are unable to anticipate future technological shifts, market needs, requirements or opportunities, or fail to develop and introduce new products, product enhancements, or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner or at all, it could cause us to lose customers, substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our products and services, and significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if we invest in developing products for a market that does not develop, it could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we are able to anticipate, develop, and commercially introduce new products, enhancements or business strategies, any such products, enhancements, or business strategies may not achieve market acceptance.\nOur strategy to expand our software business could adversely affect our competitive position\n. The success of our strategy to expand our software business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to:\n29\n•\nthe additional development efforts and costs required to create new software products and to make our products compatible with multiple technologies;\n•\nthe possibility that our software products may not achieve widespread customer adoption;\n•\nthe possibility that our strategy could erode our revenue and gross margins;\n•\nthe impact on our financial results of longer periods of revenue recognition for certain types of software products and changes in tax treatment associated with software sales;\n•\nthe additional costs associated with both domestic and international regulatory compliance, data protection, privacy and security laws, industry data security standards, and changes we need to make to our distribution chain in connection with increased software sales;\n•\nissues related to cloud-specific and AI-specific regulatory requirements in certain countries including the U.S.,U.K., EU, and APAC countries.\n•\nthe ability of our disaggregated hardware and software products to operate independently and/or to integrate with current and future third-party products; and\n•\nissues with third-party technologies used with our software products, which may be attributed to us.\nIf any of our software products or business strategies do not gain market acceptance or meet our expectations for growth, our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected and our competitive position and our business and financial results could be harmed.\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business.\nOur products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks, demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be canceled. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation, and seriously harm our business and prospects.\nOur products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party technology.\nWe integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From time to time, we may be required to renegotiate our current third-party licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models. Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms and some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them. In addition, we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products. Third-party technology we incorporate into our products that is deemed to infringe on the intellectual property of others may result, and in some cases has resulted, in limitations on our ability to source technology from those third parties, restrictions on our ability to sell products that incorporate the infringing technology, increased exposure to liability that we will be held responsible for incorporating the infringing technology in our products, and increased costs involved in removing that technology from our products or developing substitute technology. Our inability to comply with, maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements, could require us to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights, which could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information, to protect our proprietary rights. We may not be able to protect our proprietary rights, products, or, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us or to our technology if our patent applications do not result in issued patents with the scope of the claims we seek or our patents or other proprietary rights are challenged, invalidated, infringed, or circumvented. Further, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection, which could prevent our patent applications from being issued as patents or invalidate our patents following issuance, which in turn may prevent us from incorporating our inventions into our products. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, we could incur costly product redesign efforts, discontinue certain product offerings, and experience other competitive harm.\n30\nUnauthorized parties may also attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our proprietary information. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot ensure that we have entered into confidentiality or license agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that these agreements will not be breached. We cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. We are also vulnerable to third parties who illegally distribute or sell counterfeit, stolen, or unfit versions of our products, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future, and could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success.\nWe depend on contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers as well as single-source and limited source suppliers, including for key components such as semiconductors.\nOur operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as well as the ability of our manufacturers, original design manufacturers, and suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services. Given the wide variety of solutions that we offer, the large and diverse distribution of our manufacturers and suppliers, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain products, problems in production, planning and inventory management could seriously harm our business, and the shortage of key components has previously resulted in a significant disruption to our production schedule and resulted in increased prices and extended lead times. Any delay in our ability to produce and deliver our products could cause our customers to purchase alternative products from our competitors. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive than expected. Other manufacturing and supply problems that we could face are described below.\n•\nManufacturing Issues\n. We may experience supply shortfalls or delays in shipping products to our customers if our manufacturers experience delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, or if we have to change or add manufacturers or contract manufacturing locations. We have contracts with our manufacturers that include terms to protect us in the event of an early termination, yet we may not have adequate time to transition all of our manufacturing needs to an alternative manufacturer under comparable commercial terms. We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future an increase in the expected time required to manufacture our products or ship products. Moreover, a significant portion of our manufacturing is performed in foreign countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including import restrictions, export restrictions, government sanctions, disruptions to our supply chain, cyberattacks, cyberwarfare, pandemics, regional health emergencies, regional climate-related events, or regional conflicts.\n•\nSingle-Source Suppliers\n. We rely on single or limited sources for many of our components due to technology, availability, price, quality, scale or customization needs. Any supplier could discontinue manufacturing components that we use in our products, which may cause us to either suspend delivery of certain products to our customers, discontinue certain products, or incur additional costs to redesign our products that incorporate discontinued components. In addition, there has been consolidation among certain suppliers of our components. Consolidation among suppliers can result in the reduction of the number of independent suppliers of components available to us, which could negatively impact our ability to access certain component parts or the prices we have to pay for such parts and may impact our gross margins.\n•\nSupply Chain Disruption.\nAny disruptions to our supply chain, significant increase in component costs or logistics, or shortages of critical components, could decrease our sales, earnings, and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs. Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events, including, but not limited to: an extended closure of or any slowdown at our suppliers' plants or shipping delays, market shortages due to the surge in demand from other purchasers for critical components, increases in prices, including fuel prices and increases in prices due to inflation, the imposition of regulations, quotas or embargoes or tariffs on components, labor stoppages, transportation delays, including due to labor strikes, or failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods, third-party interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain, cyberattacks, the unavailability of raw materials, severe weather conditions, adverse effects of climate change, natural disasters, geopolitical developments, war or terrorism and disruptions in utilities and other services. In addition, the development, licensing, or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of components and products would adversely affect our business.\n31\n•\nComponent Supply Forecast\n. We provide demand forecasts for our products to our manufacturers, who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts. If we overestimate our requirements, our manufacturers may assess charges, or we may have liabilities for excess inventory or raw materials, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. If we underestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time, materials, and/or components required to produce our products. This could increase costs or delay or interrupt the manufacturing of our products, resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues and could negatively impact customer satisfaction. Any future spike in growth in our business, in the use of certain components we share in common with other companies, in IT spending, or in the economy in general, is likely to create greater short-term pressure on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories. If shortages or delays persist, we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build and deliver products in a timely manner, and our revenues, gross margins, and customer relationships could suffer.\n•\nAlternative Sources of Supply\n.\nThe development of alternate sources for components is time-consuming, difficult, and costly. In the event of a component shortage, supply interruption or significant price increase from these suppliers (such as with the current worldwide shortage of semiconductor products), we may not be able to locate alternative sources in a timely manner. If we are unable to buy components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers, which would seriously affect present and future sales, and would, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n•\nImpact due to Global Health Emergencies.\nDelays in production and in product deliveries due to global health emergencies or pandemics have adversely affected our business and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future. These challenges have resulted in extended lead-times to our customers and have had a negative impact on our ability to recognize associated revenue and has previously resulted in and may in the future result in an increase in accelerated ordering for certain of our products.\nWe face significant risks to our business and operations due to political and economic tensions between China and Taiwan\n. We have significant business operations in Taiwan, and some of our manufacturing partners and suppliers have facilities in Taiwan. As a result, our operations and our supply chain could be materially and negatively impacted by adverse changes in China-Taiwan relations, which have become increasingly frayed in recent years. Accordingly, further deterioration in military, political and economic relations between China and Taiwan, as well as the ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty between the U.S. and China, the unknown impact of current and future U.S. and Chinese trade regulations and other geopolitical risks with respect to China and Taiwan, may cause disruptions in the markets and industries we serve, including decreased demand from customers for products using our solutions, our supply chain, or other disruptions which may, directly or indirectly, materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our stock.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, and cyberattacks could compromise our and our customers’ proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations, and harm public perception of our products.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal data, our proprietary business information and that of our employees, contractors, customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners on our networks. In addition, we store sensitive data through cloud-based services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties. Secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We have been, and expect to be, subject to cyberattacks, and may be subject to ransomware and distributed denial-of-service attacks, spearfishing attacks and other attempted intrusions on our networks and systems by a wide range of actors, including, but not limited to, nation states, criminal enterprises, terrorist organizations, and other organizations or individuals, as well as errors, wrongful conduct or malfeasance by employees and third-party service providers (collectively, “malicious parties”). We expect our third-party vendors to be subject to similar cyberattacks, ransomware and distributed denial-of-service attacks, spearfishing attacks and other attempted intrusions. The increasing occurrence of high-profile data breaches and ransomware attacks provides evidence of an environment increasingly hostile to information security.\nDespite our security measures, and those of our third-party vendors, our information systems, infrastructure, and data have experienced security incidents and breaches and may be subject to or vulnerable to breaches or attacks, including ransomware and distributed denial-of-service attacks. If any breach or attack compromises our networks or those of our vendors, creates system disruptions or slowdowns, or exploits security vulnerabilities or critical security defects of our products and services, the information stored on our networks or the networks of our customers, suppliers or business partners could be accessed and modified, publicly disclosed, lost, destroyed or stolen, and we may be subject to claims for contractual, tort, or equitable liability and suffer reputational and financial harm. In addition, malicious parties may compromise our software, including the open-source software used in our products, or our manufacturing supply chain to embed malicious hardware, components, and software that are designed to defeat or circumvent encryption and other cybersecurity measures to interfere with the operation of our networks, expose us or our products to cyberattacks, or gain unauthorized access to our or our customers’ systems and\n32\ninformation. If such actions are successful, they could diminish customer trust in our products, harm our business reputation, and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nBecause techniques used by malicious parties to access or sabotage networks are sophisticated, change frequently, and generally are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques or the vulnerabilities they have caused or other potential vulnerabilities or security defects. Our logging of security incidents may also not be sufficient to identify or fully investigate a cybersecurity incident. Further, when vulnerabilities are discovered, we evaluate the risk, prioritize our responses, apply patches or take other remediation actions and notify customers, business partners, and suppliers, as appropriate. Exploitation of vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions, could, in each case, result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nAll of this requires significant resources and attention from management and our employees, and the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate these issues could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure. The market perception of the effectiveness of our products and our overall reputation could also be harmed as a result of any actual or perceived breach of security that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the systems of other vendors and/or to actions of malicious parties. This could impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions, which could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nAdditionally, we could be subject to measures that regulate the security of the types of products we sell. Such regulations may result in increased costs and delays in product releases and changes in features to achieve compliance, which may impact customer demand for our products, and result in regulatory investigations, potential fines, and litigation in connection with a compliance concern, security breach or related issue, and potential liability to third parties arising from such breaches. Further, in response to actual or anticipated cybersecurity regulations or contractual security requirements negotiated with our customers, we may need to make changes to existing policies, processes, and supplier relationships that could impact product offerings, release schedules and service response times, which could adversely affect the demand for and sales of our products and services. We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. If our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate, or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nDisruption in our distribution channels could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived through value-added resellers and distributors, most of which also sell our competitors’ products, and some of which sell their own competing products. The loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products. If we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with our partners, develop new relationships with value-added resellers and distributors in new markets, expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets, manage, train or motivate existing value-added resellers and distributors effectively, or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations would suffer. We recognize a portion of our revenues at the time we sell products to our distributors. If these sales are made based on inaccurate or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted. Further, our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand.\nTo develop and expand our distribution channel, we continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and have previously entered into OEM agreements with partners to rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios. These relationships require processes and procedures that may be costly or challenging to implement, maintain, and manage. Our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products. We also depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Any failure by our partners to comply with these requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe rely on the performance of our business systems and third-party systems and processes.\nSome of our business processes depend upon our IT systems, the IT systems and processes of third parties, and the interfaces between the two, as well as hosted SaaS applications from third parties. For example, we receive a broad range of information technology services, such as applications, including support, development and maintenance; infrastructure management and support, including for server storage and network devices; and end user support. Some of these services are provided to us through cloud providers, third party providers, and off-site facilities that may be vulnerable to damage or interruption, including performance problems from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, adverse events caused by\n33\noperator error, cybersecurity attacks, pandemics, and similar events. In addition, because we lease, rather than own, off-site data center facilities, we cannot be assured that we will be able to expand our data center infrastructure to meet user demand in a timely manner, or on favorable financial terms. If we have issues receiving and processing data, this may delay our ability to provide products and services to our customers and business partners and damage our business. We also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products. If those systems and processes experience interruption or delay, the manufacture and shipment of our products in a timely manner may be impaired. Since IT is critical to our operations, in addition to the risks outlined above, problems with any of the third parties we rely on for our IT systems and services, could result in liabilities to our customers and business partners, lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. We could also face significant additional costs or business disruption if our arrangements with these third parties are terminated or impaired and we cannot find alternative services or support on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis or if we are unable to hire new employees in order to provide these services in-house.\nOur ability to develop, market, and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel.\nOur success and ability to maintain a technology leadership position depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management, engineering, technical, sales, marketing, and support personnel. The supply of highly qualified individuals with technological and creative skills, in particular engineers, in specialized areas with the expertise to develop new products and enhancements for our current products, and provide reliable product maintenance, as well as the number of salespeople with industry expertise, is limited. Competition for people with the specialized technical skills we require is significant and may cause us to incur increased compensation expenses to attract and retain employees with the skills to support our business needs. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. If we fail to attract new personnel or retain and motivate our current personnel, the development and introduction of new products could be delayed, our ability to market, sell, or support our products could be impaired, and our business, results of operations, and future growth prospects could suffer.\nA number of our team members are foreign nationals who rely on visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the U.S. and other countries. In recent years, the U.S. has increased the level of scrutiny in granting H-1B, L-1, and other business visas. Compliance with new and unexpected U.S. immigration and labor laws could also require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain and attract skilled professionals. Any of these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial conditions.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by oversight of ESG matters and/or our reporting of ESG matters.\nThere is an increasing focus from U.S. and foreign government agencies, investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, including sustainable products. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on ESG initiatives, and collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s proposed climate-related reporting requirements, the recently adopted California climate reporting rules and, to the extent applicable, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. We may communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other related matters, in our Corporate Social Responsibility Report, on our website, in our SEC filings,\nand elsewhere. These initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and ensuring the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure of our ESG initiatives can be costly, difficult, and time-consuming. Further, statements about our ESG initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change. We could also face scrutiny from certain stakeholders for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our ESG goals on a timely basis, or at all, or if we were to be subject to litigation from stakeholders as a result of our ESG initiatives, our business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.\n34\nLEGAL, REGULATORY, AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe are a party to lawsuits, investigations, and other disputes.\nWe have been named a party to litigation involving a broad range of matters, including commercial transactions, employment matters, patent infringement, copyrights, trademarks, and other rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products, as well as governmental claims, and securities laws, and we may be named in additional litigation and/or governmental claims. For example, U.S. government agencies previously conducted investigations into possible violations by us of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which ultimately resulted in the Company entering into a settlement with the SEC that involved, among other things, the Company making a payment of $11.8 million in August 2019. Future claims or initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, partners, or customers. Future claims asserted and/or litigation may be initiated by third parties, including whistleblowers, and may relate to infringement of proprietary rights, issues arising under the False Claims Act, compliance with securities laws, or other matters. The expense of initiating and defending, and in some cases settling, such litigation and investigations may be costly, and may cause us to suffer reputational harm, divert management’s attention from day-to-day operations of our business, and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could disrupt our business, operations, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In addition, if we fail to comply with the terms of any settlement agreement, we could face more substantial penalties. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nFurther, increased patent litigation brought by non-practicing entities may result, and in some cases has resulted, in our customers requesting or requiring us to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation, each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they may require us to develop alternative technologies, enter into license agreements, or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services. Furthermore, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled at significant costs to us because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief.\nIf any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us or anyone we are required to indemnify is successful and we are required to pay significant monetary awards or damages to settle litigation, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or we fail to develop non-infringing technology and we incorporate infringing technology in our products, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nNon-standard contract terms with telecommunications, cable, and cloud service provider companies, and other large customers, including large enterprise customers, could have an adverse effect on our business or impact the amount of revenues to be recognized.\nTelecommunications, cable, and cloud service provider companies, and other large companies, including large enterprise customers, generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers. As one such supplier, we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions, which may include terms that affect the amount or timing of or our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms from us.\nRegulations of our industry or of our customers could harm our operating results and future prospects.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and policies affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas. For example, some governments have regulations prohibiting customers (both government and commercial) from purchasing products that do not meet country-specific safety, conformance, or security certification criteria or in-country test requirements. Other regulations that may negatively impact our business include local content or local manufacturing requirements most commonly applicable for government, state-owned enterprise, or regulated industry procurements. The rapid development and deployment of tools that leverage AI is also causing governments to consider regulation of AI, even for AI that does not pertain to personal data. These types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business. For example, in December 2023, the EU agreed upon a legal framework on AI: the AI Act. It is expected that the text of the AI Act will be negotiated and adopted in 2024. If adopted, the AI Act will ban certain AI systems, regulate general purpose AI, impose heavy obligations on high-risk AI systems, subject to high fines, and support innovation through regulatory “sandboxes.” This framework, as currently proposed, may impact our products and services deployed in the EU.\nThe SEC requires us, as a public company that uses certain raw materials considered to be “conflict minerals” in our products, to report publicly on the extent to which “conflict minerals” are in our supply chain. As a provider of hardware end-products, we are several steps removed from the mining, smelting, or refining of any conflict minerals. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of these raw materials is limited. Our relationships with customers, suppliers, and investors could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as “conflict-free.” We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements.\n35\nEnvironmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations, including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment, may adversely impact our business and financial condition. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and expected future requirements relating to the chemical and material composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change laws, and regulations and product take-back legislation, which could require us to cease selling non-compliant products and to reengineer our products to use compliant components, which could result in additional costs to us, disrupt our operations, and result in an adverse impact on our operating results. In addition, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws, our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions, which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.\nIn addition, as a contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. government, our IT systems are subject to federal regulations that require compliance with security and privacy controls. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in a loss of federal government business, subject us to claims or other remedies for non-compliance, or negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, some government customers have implemented and could continue to implement procurement policies that impact our profitability. Procurement policies favoring more non-commercial purchases, different pricing, or evaluation criteria or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer’s view of what our pricing should be, could affect the margins on such contracts or make it more difficult to compete on certain types of programs. Moreover, the failure to comply with government contracting provisions could result in penalties or the ineligibility to compete for future contracts. Government customers are continually evaluating their contract pricing and financing practices, and we have no assurance regarding what changes will be proposed, if any, and their impact on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nMoreover, our commercial customers may be subject to regulations and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations. Further, we could be affected by new laws or regulations on access to or commerce on IP networks in jurisdictions where we market our solutions. Regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers' needs for products. Also, many jurisdictions have or are evaluating regulations relating to cybersecurity, supply chain integrity, privacy and data protection, any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment. Additionally, certain countries where our customers operate may require that our products sold in that country be made locally or made in particular geographies, or satisfy local regulations for critical infrastructure projects, either of which could impact our ability to compete in those markets and may also negatively impact our margins due to the costs incurred to comply with these requirements.\nThe implementation of additional regulations could reduce demand for our products, increase the cost of building and selling our products, result in product inventory write-offs, impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner, require us to spend significant time and expense to comply with, and subject us to fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations. Any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernmental regulations, economic sanctions and other legal restrictions that affect international trade or affect movement and disposition of our products and component parts could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.\nThe U.S. and other governments have imposed restrictions on the import and export of, among other things, certain telecommunications products and components, particularly those that contain or use encryption technology. Most of our products are telecommunications products that contain or use encryption technology and, consequently, are subject to restrictions. The scope, nature, and severity of such controls vary widely across different countries and may change frequently over time. In many cases, these government restrictions require a license prior to importing or exporting a good. Such licensing requirements can introduce delays into our operations as we or our channel partners must apply for the license and wait for government officials to process it or perform pre-shipment inspections; it is possible that lengthy delays will lead to the cancellation of orders by customers. Moreover, if we, our suppliers, or our channel partners fail to obtain necessary licenses prior to importing or exporting covered goods, we can be subject to government sanctions, including monetary penalties, conditions, and restrictions. Such license requirements, and any fines or other sanctions imposed for their violation could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.\nIn addition, the U.S. and other governments have especially broad sanctions and embargoes prohibiting provision of goods or services to certain countries, territories, sanctioned governments, businesses, and individuals. We have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into restricted countries or to prohibited entities or individuals, but there can be no assurance that our third party, downstream resellers, and distributors will abide by these restrictions or have processes in place to ensure compliance.\n36\nCertain governments also impose special local content, certification, testing, source code review, escrow, and governmental recovery of private encryption keys, or other cybersecurity feature requirements to protect network equipment and software procured by or for the government. Similar requirements also may be imposed in procurements by state owned entities or even private companies forming part of “critical network infrastructure” or supporting sensitive industries.\nIn recent years, U.S. government officials have had concerns with the security of products and services from certain telecommunications and video providers based in China, Russia, and other regions. As a result, the U.S. government has imposed bans on the use of certain Chinese-origin and Russian-origin components or systems either in items sold to the U.S. government or in the internal networks of government contractors and subcontractors (even if those networks are not used for government-related projects). U.S. regulations also permit the U.S. government to investigate and possibly mandate the unwinding of commercial transactions between U.S. companies and foreign suppliers. This introduces uncertainty into our supply chain, our imports of end products and our overall operational planning.\nIn May 2021, the U.S. President issued an executive order on cybersecurity that signals the U.S. government’s interest in developing standards and guidelines pertaining to Information and Communication Technology supply chains, government network capabilities and requirements, and cyber threat and vulnerability remediation. These standards and guidelines could impact how we develop hardware and software, what features our products have, and our role in helping the U.S. government respond to cyber threats and vulnerabilities.\nIn response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. and certain allies imposed sanctions against the Russian government and other entities, which led to our suspension of operations in Russia, Belarus, and in the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea regions of Ukraine. Accordingly, we are not able to sell or deliver our products or provide ongoing support services to our customers in Russia, Belarus, and in the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea regions of Ukraine. The response by Russia and other countries to these sanctions could lead to an escalation of political tensions, economic instability in the area, and cyberwarfare. These actions, as well as the effect of such actions on macroeconomic conditions, could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA wide variety of provincial, state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, extensive, and complex. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development and offering of new products and services. In addition, the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection-related laws in some cases is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes, including the potential for various regulator or other governmental bodies to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, or to increase penalties. Moreover, there are a number of other legislative proposals worldwide, including in the U.S. at both the federal and state level, that could impose additional and potentially conflicting obligations in areas affecting our business. Examples of recent and anticipated developments that have impacted or could impact our business include the following:\n•\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides significant penalties for noncompliance. As GDPR enforcement evolves, we may find it necessary to make further changes to our handling of personal data of residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The regulatory environment applicable to the handling of EEA residents’ personal data, and our actions in addressing such environment, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business, operating results, and financial condition being harmed. In addition, we and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the EEA relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the EEA. Any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel, and negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n•\nData protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the U.S. at both the federal and state level. State laws that are being enacted may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, adapt our goods and services, and incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. Some state laws impose civil penalties on violators and authorize private rights of action, both of which might lead to an increase in the frequency and cost associated with data breach litigation.\n•\nThe Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data.\n•\nWe may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored within that country.\n37\n•\nBoth U.S. federal and state, and non-U.S. governments are considering laws and regulations governing AI and machine learning tools that leverage commercial and consumer data, such as the EU's provisional AI Act. These laws may impact some of our products and services, internal business processes and applications, and procurement of vendor solutions. This may increase our liability risks and cause us to incur additional costs and expenses in order to comply.\n•\nAmong other emerging global privacy laws, India has adopted its Digital Personal Data Protection Act of 2023 (\"DPDP Act\"). Given our significant employee and operational presence in India, passage of the DPDP Act may cause us to implement new processes and policies necessary to comply with the new regulation and incur related additional costs.\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. Further, evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the EU, the U.S., the U.K., and elsewhere, including the classification of IP addresses, machine identification information, location data, and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting business relationships and partnerships that may involve the sharing or uses of data, and may require significant costs, resources, and efforts in order to comply.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nOur financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our goodwill was $3,734.4 million, and our purchased intangible assets were $91.8 million. We are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, annually or, in certain instances, more frequently, and may be required to record impairment charges, which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred. Our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. However, any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in effective tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nOur future effective tax rates and the amount of our taxable income could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by the following: earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; changes in the research and development (“R&D”) tax laws applicable to us; transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions, including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement; costs related to intercompany restructuring; tax effects of share-based compensation; challenges to our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements; limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense; or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. Our future effective tax rate may be impacted by judicial decisions, changes in interpretation of regulations, as well as additional legislation and guidance.\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Several of the proposals currently being considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows. Further, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”), an international association of 38 countries, including the U.S., has issued guidelines that change long-standing tax principles. The OECD guidelines may introduce tax uncertainty as countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the guidelines. Some countries have enacted, and others have proposed, taxes based on gross receipts applicable to digital services, regardless of profitability. Substantially all member countries of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreed to certain tax principles, including a global minimum tax of 15%. In December 2022, the EU reached unanimous agreement, in principle, to implement the global minimum tax. EU members initiated legislation to adopt global minimum tax provisions in 2023, which are intended to be effective for tax years beginning after 2023. Additional changes to global tax laws are likely to occur, and such changes may adversely affect our tax liability.\nIn addition, we are generally subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, but the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\n38\nWe are subject to risks arising from our international operations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations, and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and value-added resellers in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the U.S. In addition, a portion of our R&D and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the U.S. As a result of our international operations, we are affected by economic, business, regulatory, social, and political conditions in foreign countries, including the following:\n•\nchanges in general IT spending;\n•\nglobal macroeconomic conditions, including recessionary cycles;\n•\nthe imposition of government controls, inclusive of critical infrastructure protection;\n•\nchanges in trade controls, economic sanctions, or other international trade regulations, which have in general recently trended toward increasing breadth and complexity of controls, and which may affect our ability to import or export our products to or from various countries;\n•\nlaws that restrict sales of products that are developed, manufactured, or incorporate components or assemblies sourced from certain countries or suppliers to specific customers and industry segments, or for particular uses;\n•\nvarying and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, changes in laws and interpretation of laws, misappropriation of intellectual property and reduced intellectual property protection;\n•\npolitical uncertainty, including demonstrations, that could have an impact on product delivery;\n•\nimpact of geopolitical tensions, challenges, and uncertainties as a result of armed conflicts (such as the Israel-Hamas war, and conflicts related to the attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea) and resulting sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries against governmental or other entities, that may lead to disruption, instability, and volatility in global and regional financial markets, as well as higher inflation, increases in prices of commodities, and disruptions to supply chains;\n•\nincreased tensions among the U.S., the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Russia that could increase the threat of armed conflict, cyberwarfare and economic instability and could disrupt or delay operations or resources in Ukraine or Russia, disrupt or delay communication with such resources or the flow of funds to support operations, or otherwise render our resources unavailable;\n•\nfluctuations in local economies, including inflationary conditions that could make our solutions more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries;\n•\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates (see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information);\n•\ntax policies, treaties, or laws that could have an unfavorable business impact;\n•\nthe negotiation and implementation of free trade agreements between the U.S. and other nations;\n•\ndata privacy rules and other regulations that affect cross border data flow;\n•\nthe impact of adverse public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics, in the countries in which we operate or where our customers are located; and\n•\ntheft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and other confidential business information.\nAny or all of these factors has or could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMoreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the U.S. or in other countries in which we operate. In many foreign countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations. Certain countries (such as Russia, China, and EU member nations with regard to Iran trade) prohibit individuals and companies resident in or operating within their borders to comply with foreign sanctions imposed on such countries themselves or on third countries. Our employees, contractors, channel partners, and agents may fail to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and policies in violation of our policies and procedures, which are designed to help ensure compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners, or agents could result in termination of our relationship, financial reporting problems, fines, and/or penalties for us, or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $1,700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes, which we refer to collectively as the “Notes”. In June 2023, we entered into a new credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five-year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, with an option to increase the credit facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to the lenders' approval.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to satisfy our expenses, make anticipated capital expenditures or service our indebtedness, including the Notes. Our ability to pay our expenses, satisfy our debt obligations, refinance our\n39\ndebt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures is dependent upon our future performance, restrictions imposed on the Company by the Merger Agreement during the interim period between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, and our ability to manage these risks in addition to other factors discussed in this section.\nThe indenture that governs the Notes contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: grant liens, incur sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to another person. Further, the Credit Agreement contains one financial covenant along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following:\n•\nmaintenance of a leverage ratio no greater than 3.0x (provided that if a material acquisition has been consummated, we are permitted to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 3.5x for up to four quarters); and\n•\ncovenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, change their accounting or reporting policies, change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business. In addition, under applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations, there are limitations on the deductibility of net business interest expenses. As a result, if our taxable income were to decline, we may not be able to fully deduct our net interest expense, which could have a material impact on our business.\nFurther, we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that influence our credit ratings include HPE's rating and outlook and our financial strength, as well as our transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. We may not be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\nOur investments are subject to risks, which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nWe have substantial investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, foreign government debt securities, money market funds, mutual funds, time deposits, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. government securities. We also have investments in privately-held companies, including equity and debt securities. Certain of our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, sovereign debt, and interest rate risks. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or if the decline in fair value related to creditworthiness of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be material, or due to certain inherent risks involved in investments in early-stage privately-held companies. For example, we have recognized and may in the future recognize additional losses on an investment, if we determine that an investment without readily determinable fair value is not likely to be recovered. In addition, should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may be subject to risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nFailing to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes, or any weaknesses in our internal controls may adversely affect investor perception, and our stock price.\nWe will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures to manage and grow our business effectively in the future. We are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner. If in the future, our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to not be effective, resulting in a material weakness, investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected, which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum.\nThe exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors, officers, and other employees. These provisions do not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\n40\nadditional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business."

    "text": "Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy:\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things, internal operational risks; system security risks; data protection; risks to proprietary business information; intellectual property theft; fraud; extortion; harm to employees, partners, or customers; violation of privacy or security laws and other litigation and legal risk; and reputational risks. We have implemented several cybersecurity processes, technologies, and controls to aid in our efforts to identify, assess, and manage such material risks.\nTo aide in identifying and assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats, our enterprise risk management program considers cybersecurity risks alongside other significant company risks as part of our overall risk assessment process. As part of this process, the Company gathers input from subject matter specialists, as necessary, to gather insights to help in identifying and assessing material cybersecurity threat risks, as well as potential severity and mitigation measures. We also have a cybersecurity specific risk assessment process, which helps identify potential cybersecurity risks. We employ a range of tools and services, including regular network and endpoint monitoring, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and tabletop exercises to inform our professionals’ risk identification and assessment.\nWe manage these known risks by using internal security controls designed to align with standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”), the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), and the Center for Internet Security (“CIS”), and by engaging third party experts to perform penetration tests to attempt to infiltrate our information systems, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These penetration tests are focused on specific objectives to assist us in managing our cybersecurity threat risks. Our maturity in these controls varies by control type and by business.\nWe also conduct the following activities at various intervals during the year, which vary in maturity across our business:\n•\nmonitor emerging data protection laws and implement changes from time-to-time to our processes designed to comply;\n•\nundertake regular reviews of our customer facing policies and statements related to cybersecurity;\n•\nthrough policy, practice, and contract (as applicable) require employees, who provide services on our behalf, to treat customer information and data with care;\n•\nleverage the NIST incident handling framework to help us prepare, detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, respond, and recover when there is an actual or potential cybersecurity incident;\n•\nrun exercises to simulate a response to a cybersecurity incident and use the findings to improve our processes and technologies;\n•\nrun exercises to simulate a response to a cybersecurity incident to provide training to our cyber incident response team;\n•\nrun annual tabletop exercises to train our executives and increase their cybersecurity awareness;\n•\nconduct a variety of information security and privacy trainings, including new employee training, job-specific security training, specialized training for IT and security personnel, and phishing simulations.\n•\nhold an annual Cybersecurity Awareness Month programming, which is available for all employees during which we provide seminars, presentations, and employee engagement activities designed to reinforce our employee information security training and enhance the culture and knowledge of cybersecurity risks among our employees;\n•\ncarry information security risk insurance to help defray potential losses that might arise from a cybersecurity incident.\nOur cybersecurity incident response plan was developed to respond to the threat of security breaches, the threat of cyberattacks, and to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of information owned by, or in the care of, the Company. Our incident response plan coordinates the activities that we take to prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents, which include processes to triage, assess severity for, escalate material cybersecurity incidents to our global crisis management plan, contain, investigate, and remediate the incident, as well as to comply with potentially applicable legal obligations and mitigate brand and reputational damage.\n42\nOur processes also address cybersecurity threat risks associated with our use of third party service providers, including those in our supply chain or who have access to our customer and employee data or our systems. Third-party risks are included within our enterprise risk management assessment program, as well as our cybersecurity-specific risk identification program, both of which are discussed above. In addition, cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of our third-party service providers. We perform diligence on third parties that have access to our systems, data or facilities that house such systems or data, and continually monitor cybersecurity threat risks identified through such diligence. Additionally, we generally require those third parties that could introduce significant cybersecurity risk to us to agree by contract to manage their cybersecurity risks in specified ways, and to agree to be subject to cybersecurity audits.\nWe regularly engage with assessors, consultants, auditors, and other third parties, including by regularly having third parties, including independent Qualified Security Assessors review our cybersecurity program to help identify areas for continued focus, improvement and/or compliance.\nIn our risk factors, we describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCybersecurity Governance:\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. The Board has oversight responsibility for the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management framework. The Board as a whole and through the various Board committees oversees the Company’s management of material enterprise level risk, focusing on four areas of risk: strategic, compliance, operational, and financial.  To fulfill its oversight responsibility, the Board also regularly reviews, consults, and discusses with management on strategic direction, challenges, and risks faced by the Company.\nAs part of our entire Board's operational risk management responsibilities, it has oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee has been designated with the responsibility to regularly review the Company’s processes and procedures around managing cybersecurity threat risks and cybersecurity incidents. As discussed below, members of management report to the Audit Committee which reports to the entire Board about cybersecurity threat risks, among other cybersecurity related matters, at least annually.\nIn support of the Board's oversight of the Company's cybersecurity risk management program, the Audit Committee receives (i) quarterly updates or reports delivered directly from our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) and Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) and (ii) three reports delivered as part of the Company's enterprise risk management update to the Audit Committee. These reports may be supplemented, as needed, by the CIO, CISO, and other executives at the Company. These reports include a variety of cybersecurity topics, such as threat risk management updates, the results of exercises and response readiness assessments, our incident response plan, and steps management has taken to respond to such threat risks. In such sessions, the Audit Committee receives materials including a cybersecurity scorecard and other materials indicating current and emerging material cybersecurity threat risks, and describing the Company’s ability to mitigate those risks, and discusses such matters with our CIO and CISO.\nMembers of the Board and Audit Committee are also encouraged to regularly engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs. Material cybersecurity threat risks are also considered during separate Board meeting discussions of important matters like enterprise risk management, operational budgeting, mergers and acquisitions, and other relevant matters.\nOur CISO oversees our cybersecurity risk management program in partnership with our CIO and other business leaders, including our General Counsel. These members of management are informed about and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above.\nOur CIO has developed expertise in cybersecurity and compliance, enterprise architecture and road mapping, data and analytics, digital transformation and customer service through her 39 years of experience in the information technology space. She earned her computer science degree from Temple University and currently teaches in the Masters in Information Systems program at University of San Francisco. Our CISO has worked in cybersecurity for 25 years, including thirteen years as a CISO or deputy CISO. He is currently a Certified Information Systems Security Professional and holds an Information Systems Security\n43\nArchitecture Professional sub-certification (CISSP-ISSAP). He also holds a masters of science degree in computer science, with an information security specialization from James Madison University.\n44"

    "text": "The following discussion should be read with the Business section in Item 1 of Part I and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this Report, we have provided an executive overview, which includes a financial results and key performance metrics overview and a discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management. These sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A of Part I, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nExecutive Overview\nProposed Merger with Hewlett Packard Enterprise\nOn January 9, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, a Delaware corporation (“HPE”), and Jasmine Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of HPE (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of HPE. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $40.00 in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes.\nThe Merger Agreement generally requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to operate our business in the ordinary course, subject to certain exceptions including as required by applicable law, pending consummation of the Merger, and subjects the Company to customary interim operating covenants that restrict us from taking certain specified actions without HPE’s approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) until the Merger is completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. During this period, we are permitted to continue paying regular quarterly dividends, substantially in accordance with past practice, at a quarterly rate not to exceed $0.22 per share.\nThe completion of the Merger, which is currently expected to close in late calendar year 2024 or early calendar year 2025, is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders. If the transaction is consummated, our common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nSee the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Report for further discussion about the risks related to the Merger.\n48\nFinancial Results and Key Performance Metrics Overview\nThe following table provides an overview of our financial results and key financial metrics (in millions, except per share amounts, percentages, and days sales outstanding, or DSO):\n________________________________\n(1)\nDSO is for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, and 2022.\n(2)\nIncludes deferred revenue from hardware solutions, software licenses, software support and maintenance and SaaS offerings sold in our Automated WAN Solutions, Cloud-Ready Data Center, and AI-Driven Enterprise customer solution categories.\n•\nNet Revenues:\nNet revenues increased during 2023 compared to 2022 driven by a growth in Enterprise vertical, partially offset by a decline in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals. Net revenues increased across all geographies. Service net revenues increased primarily driven by strong sales of hardware maintenance contracts and SaaS subscriptions.\n•\nGross Margin:\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to improved service gross margin. The increase in service gross margin was mainly due to higher revenue from hardware maintenance and software subscriptions and lower service delivery costs.\n•\nOperating Margin:\nOperating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses driven by an increase in headcount and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by the drivers described in the gross margin discussion above.\n49\n•\nOperating Cash Flows:\nNet cash provided by operations increased primarily due to improvements in working capital and one-time proceeds from the termination of our interest rate lock contracts, partially offset by higher cash taxes and increased compensation payments.\n•\nCapital Return:\nWe continued to return capital to our stockholders. During 2023, we repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $29.47 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $385.0 million. During 2023, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.22 per share, for an aggregate amount of $280.8 million.\n•\nDSO:\nDSO is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net revenues for the preceding 90 days. DSO decreased primarily due to improved invoicing linearity, partially offset by lower revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.\n•\nDeferred Revenue:\nTotal deferred revenue increased, primarily driven by the timing of contract renewals and increase in deferrals of SaaS and software license subscriptions.\nGlobal Supply and Demand Update\nGlobal economic and business activities continue to face widespread macroeconomic uncertainties, including inflation, monetary policy shifts, recession risks, and turmoil in the geopolitical environment, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the political and economic tensions between China and Taiwan, the Israel-Hamas war, and escalating tensions in the Red Sea in connection with the attacks by the Houthis to disrupt shipments. Our overall performance depends in-part on global economic conditions, as well as other disruptions and the impacts of such conditions on our customers.\nWe have a global supply chain, which is primarily composed of manufacturing partners, component suppliers, and third-party logistics partners. In prior periods, global supply chain constraints and component parts shortages resulted in extended lead times of certain products to our customers and impacted the volume of products we were able to deliver, which negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue. Throughout fiscal year 2023, we saw an overall improvement of industry-wide supply constraints.\nWhile global component shortages persisted in prior periods, certain customers placed advanced product orders in an effort to secure supply. These elevated product order levels declined throughout 2023 as supply chain constraints eased. As a result, we expect our backlog to normalize in 2024 as our customers consume previously placed advance orders and normalize their buying patterns.\nIn prior years, we committed to purchase additional inventory to meet customer demands for our products and to mitigate supply constraints. As a result, our inventory levels increased in 2023 and are expected to remain elevated in the near term. When we became aware of an inability to sell this inventory, we recognized inventory obsolescence charges, and we expect to continue to incur future inventory obsolescence charges, which may be material. Our purchase commitments are expected to continue to decline as our supplier lead times normalize. Our operating cash flows have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by significant inventories at our contract manufacturers.\nManagement continues to actively monitor the impact of macroeconomic factors on the Company's financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. The extent of the impact on our operations and financial performance, our ability to execute our business strategies, and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on the impact of macroeconomic factors on our customers, partners, employees, contract manufacturers and supply chain. See the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Report for further discussion.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Note 1,\nDescription of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting\n50\nPolicies\n, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe below accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.\n•\nRevenue Recognition:\nWe enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while most of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain non-standard terms and conditions and include promises to transfer multiple goods or services. As a result, significant interpretation and judgment are sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions, including: (1) whether performance obligations are considered distinct that should be accounted for separately versus together, how the price should be allocated among the performance obligations, and when to recognize revenue for each performance obligation; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct performance obligation; (3) combining contracts that may impact the allocation of the transaction price between product and services; and (4) estimating and accounting for variable consideration, including rights of return, rebates, price protection, expected penalties or other price concessions as a reduction of the transaction price.\nOur estimates of SSP for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors, including, but not limited to, historical discounting trends for products and services, pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, and industry technology lifecycles. Our estimates for rights of return, rebates, and price protection are based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria outlined in customer contracts or rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Our estimates for expected penalties and other price concessions are based on historical trends and expectations regarding future incurrence.\nChanges in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.\n•\nIncome Taxes:\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We apply the authoritative accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our taxes including the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\n•\nInventory Valuation and Contract Manufacturer Liabilities\n: Inventory consists primarily of components and finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. A provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated future demand for customer orders or that may become obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. In addition, we record a liability for the possible repurchase of quantities held by our contract manufacturers in excess of anticipated future demand or that may become obsolete.\nSignificant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete materials exposure. We perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, or if there was a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology, our customer requirements, changes in market conditions, or new product introductions, we may be required to\n51\nincrease our provision and contract manufacturer liabilities, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory excess, obsolescence and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1,\nDescription of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n52\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 can be found under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 10, 2023, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at http://investor.juniper.net.\nRevenues\nThe following table presents net revenues by customer solution, customer vertical, and geographic region (in millions, except percentages):\nTotal net revenues increased primarily due to growth in AI-Driven Enterprise and Hardware Maintenance and Professional Services, which were mainly driven by higher sales volume, partially offset by a decline in Cloud-Ready Data Center and Automated WAN Solutions.\n53\nThe AI-Driven Enterprise revenue increase was primarily driven by Enterprise and Service Provider, partially offset by a decline in Cloud.\nThe decreases in Cloud-Ready Data Center revenue and the Automated WAN Solutions revenue were primarily due to a decline in Cloud and Service Provider, partially offset by a growth in Enterprise.\nAlso, software and security products and services represent key areas of our strategic focus that are critical components to our business success. Software and related service offerings include revenue from software license, software support and maintenance and SaaS contracts. Total security offerings include revenue from our complete portfolio of hardware and software security products, including SD-WAN solutions, as well as services related to our security solutions.\nThe following table presents net revenues from software and security products and services (in millions, except percentages):\nGross Margins\nThe following table presents gross margins (in millions, except percentages):\nOur gross margins as a percentage of net revenues have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including general inflationary pressures, the mix and average selling prices of our products and services, new product introductions and enhancements, manufacturing, component and logistics costs, expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations, cost of support and service personnel, customer mix as we continue to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers, the mix of distribution channels through which our products and services are sold, and import tariffs.\nFor example, in prior periods, our logistics and other supply chain-related costs increased due to the global component shortage, and we saw cost improvement in 2023 due to the overall reduction in industry-wide supply constraints. For more information on the impact of supply chain constraints on our business, see the\n“Risk Factors” section of Item 1A of Part I of this Report\n.\nProduct gross margin\nProduct gross margin as a percentage of product revenues increased primarily due to the easing of elevated logistics and other supply chain costs and favorable software revenue mix, partially offset by higher inventory-related expenses and unfavorable product mix. We continue to undertake specific efforts to address certain factors impacting our product gross margin. These efforts include performance and quality improvements through engineering to increase value across our products; optimizing our supply chain and service business; pricing management; and increasing software and solution sales.\nService gross margin\nService gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased primarily due to higher revenue from hardware maintenance and software subscriptions and lower service delivery costs.\n54\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents operating expenses (in millions, except percentages):\nOur operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnel-related costs, including salaries and wages; commissions and bonuses, which we refer to collectively as variable compensation; benefits; share-based compensation; and travel. Facility and information technology, or IT, departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount. We had a total of 11,144 and 10,901 employees as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our headcount increased by 243 employees, or 2%.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expense increased primarily due to higher share-based compensation and other personnel-related costs driven by headcount growth.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs driven by headcount growth and higher variable compensation.\nRestructuring charges\nRestructuring charges increased primarily due to expenses recorded in connection with our restructuring plans approved in the third quarter of 2023. For further explanation of our restructuring charges, see Note 7,\nRestructuring Charges\n, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\n55\nGain (Loss) on Privately-Held Investments, Net\nThe following table presents the gain (loss) on privately-held investments, net (in millions, except percentages):\n______________________\nN/M - Not meaningful\nIn 2023, the Company recognized an unrealized loss on its privately-held equity investments due to declines in fair values. The Company estimated the fair value of these investments based on quantitative and qualitative analysis. This analysis involved use of judgment, significant estimates, and assumptions, such as the near-term prospects of the investee in the market in which it operates, evaluating the investee’s financial condition in relation to its outstanding obligations, and probabilities of securing additional capital through various alternative scenarios.\nGain on Divestiture\nThe following table presents the gain on divestiture (in millions, except percentages):\nIn 2022, we recognized a gain of $45.8 million related to the divestiture of our silicon photonics business for cash consideration of $90.0 million and a 25% equity interest in the business.\nOther Expense, Net\nThe following table presents other expense, net (in millions, except percentages):\n_______________\n(1)\nOther investments represent fixed income securities and equity investments with readily determinable fair value.\n(2)\nThe prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nInterest income primarily includes interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Interest expense primarily includes interest, net of capitalized interest expense, from long-term debt and customer financing arrangements. Gain (loss) on other investments, net, primarily includes gains (losses) from the sale of investments in fixed income securities and equity investments with readily determinable fair values. Other typically consists of foreign exchange gains and losses and other non-operational income and expense items.\nTotal other expense, net, decreased primarily due to higher interest income related to our fixed income investment portfolio, as a result of higher yields and higher net gains from equity investments, partially offset by higher interest expense related to our debt portfolio.\n56\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe following table presents income tax provision (in millions, except percentages):\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 was lower than fiscal year 2022, primarily due to the net difference in discrete items in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 and a change in the geographic mix of earnings. For a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see Note 12,\nIncome Taxes\n, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Act\"), all our U.S. and non-U.S. based R&D expenditures are being capitalized and amortized over five and fifteen years, respectively. In 2023, the new regulations resulted in incremental cash tax payments of approximately $150 million and a reduction in our effective tax rate due to increased benefit from U.S. foreign-derived intangible income and an increased federal R&D credit. Future impacts will primarily depend on if and when this legislation is deferred, modified, or repealed by the U.S. Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of R&D expenditures paid or incurred in those respective years. We estimate the largest impact will have been to 2022 cash flow from operations and that the impact in future years should gradually decrease over the five- and fifteen-year amortization periods. The Company’s future effective tax rate may be impacted.\nEuropean Union members and certain other countries initiated legislation to adopt global minimum tax provisions in 2023, which are intended to be effective for tax years beginning after 2023. We do not expect to incur significant global minimum taxes in 2024.\n57\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions, investments in strategic relationships, and payment of cash dividends on our common stock. Since the enactment of the Tax Act, we have repatriated a significant amount of cash from outside of the U.S., and plan to continue to repatriate on an ongoing basis. We intend to use the repatriated cash to invest in the business, support value-enhancing mergers and acquisitions, and fund our return of capital to stockholders.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term, and long-term investments, and cash generated from operations together with the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations; planned dividends; capital expenditures; purchase commitments and other liquidity requirements; and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including, but not limited to, our growth rate; the timing and amount we spend to support development efforts; the expansion of sales and marketing activities; the introduction of new and enhanced products and services; the costs to acquire or invest in businesses and technologies; an increase in manufacturing or component costs; certain interim operating covenants that we have agreed to in the Merger Agreement; and the risks and uncertainties detailed in the “Risk Factors” section of Item 1A of Part I of this Report.\nThe Company's material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn June 2023, we entered into a new credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five-year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to the lenders' approval. The Company's previous $500.0 million revolving credit facility was terminated concurrently with the Company entering into the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate in June 2028, subject to two one-year maturity extension options, on the terms and conditions set forth in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement, and no amounts were outstanding. In connection with our entry into the Merger Agreement, certain terms limit our ability to drawdown the full amount of $500.0 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility. Refer to Note 8,\nDebt and Financing,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for information on the credit agreement.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding fixed-rate senior notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $1,700.0 million (collectively the \"Notes\"), none of which is payable within 12 months. As of December 31, 2023, future interest payments associated with the Notes total $594.6 million, with $55.4 million payable within 12 months.\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\nIn order to reduce manufacturing lead times and in the interest of having access to adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and certain suppliers to procure inventory based on the Company's requirements. A significant portion of the Company's purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm and non-cancelable commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust its requirements based on the Company's business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of December 31, 2023, we had purchase commitments of $1,291.6 million, with $989.5 million payable within 12 months.\nTax\nOur transition tax liability represents future cash payments on accumulated foreign earnings of subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Act. The Company has elected to pay its transition tax, net of applicable tax refunds, over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of our transition tax obligation was $179.7 million, with $73.4 million payable within 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $92.7 million included in long-term income taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.\n58\nIn 2023, we made tax payments of approximately $406 million of which approximately $150 million can be attributed to the capitalization and amortization requirements for R&D expenditures pursuant to the Tax Act.\nLeases\nThe Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that have remaining lease terms of 1 to 8 years and 1 to 4 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $138.7 million, with $47.1 million payable within 12 months.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations - Other\nUnconditional purchase obligations consist of agreements that include firm and non-cancelable terms to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum amounts or quantities to be purchased at fixed or minimum prices. As of December 31, 2023, we had unconditional purchase obligations of $69.6 million, with $33.1 million payable within 12 months. See Note 14,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for further discussion of our unconditional purchase obligations.\nGuarantees\nWe have financial guarantees consisting of third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities, insurance programs, and customs of $32.5 million as of December 31, 2023.\nCapital Return\nIn addition to our cash requirements, we have a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). In January 2018, the Board, approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which we refer to as the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. In October 2019, the Board authorized a $1.0 billion increase to the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program for a total of $3.0 billion.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 13.1 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $29.47 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $385.0 million, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2023, there was $0.2 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.\nIn connection with our entry into the Merger Agreement, we suspended our 2018 Stock Repurchase Program and will not repurchase our common stock subsequent to year end 2023. See Note 9,\nEquity\n, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for further discussion of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.\nIn addition, any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the Board or an authorized committee thereof. See Note 15,\nSubsequent Events\n, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for discussion of our dividend declaration subsequent to December 31, 2023.\n59"

    "text": "Interest Rate Risk\nInterest Income Risk - Available-for-Sale Fixed Income Securities\nThe primary objectives of our investment activities are, in order of priority, to preserve principal, maintain liquidity, and maximize yield. The value of our investments is subject to market price volatility. To minimize this risk, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities, which includes asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, foreign government debt securities, time deposits, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. government securities. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures.\nThe following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our available-for-sale fixed income securities held as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points, or BPS, 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate (in millions):\nInterest rate swap contracts\nThe Company uses interest rate swap contracts to convert certain of our fixed interest rate notes to floating interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), resulting in a net increase or decrease in interest expense. These swap contracts hedge against the interest rate risk exposures of the designated debt issuances. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swap contracts was\n$600.0 million\n. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts resulted in\na liability of $73.6 million and\n$87.4 million, respectively\n.\nA hypothetical 10% change in the interest rates as of December 31, 2023\nwould not have had a material impact to our operating results or the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts.\nForeign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts\nThe Company uses derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately\none to four months.\nOur sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars as well as other foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Chinese Yuan, Euro, and the Indian Rupee. Approximately\n79%\nof such costs and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and/or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by non-U.S. Dollar denominated operating expense and costs. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of\nthirty-six\nmonths or less. The change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior periods resulted in a reduction to our operating expenses including cost of service revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, by\n$20.5 million, or 0.5%, and by\n60\n$69.4 million, or 1.7%,\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. See Note 4,\nDerivative Instruments\n, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for further discussion of our derivative and hedging activity.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of non-U.S. Dollar cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10% movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, with all other variables held constant. The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and investments we would report in U.S. Dollars as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 by\n$35.8 million, or 2.7%,\nand by $32.3 million, or 2.7%, respectively.\nEquity Price Risk\nWe have also invested in privately-held companies. Depending on the nature of these investments, some can be carried at cost, adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment, and others can be carried at fair value. An investment under the equity method of accounting is initially measured at fair value and subsequently adjusted for any impairment, investee capital transactions, dividend received, plus or minus the Company's proportionate share of the equity method investee's income or loss. The carrying values of our investments in privately-held companies were $121.9 million and $226.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The privately-held companies in which we invest can still be considered to be in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages, and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately-held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.\n61"

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nIdentification of distinct performance obligations in revenue contracts\n63\nInventory Valuation & Contract Manufacturer Liabilities\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 7, 2024\n64\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Juniper Networks, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Juniper Networks, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Juniper Networks, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and our report dated February 7, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 7, 2024\n65\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n__________________\n(1)\nThe prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\n(2)\nPrivately-held investments represent investments in privately-held debt, redeemable preferred stock securities, and equity investments without readily determinable fair value.\nRefer to Note 2,\nCash Equivalents and Investments.\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n66\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n67\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In millions, except par values)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n68\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(In millions)\n69\n_________________\n(1)\nThe prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n70\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n71\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1. Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nJuniper Networks, Inc. (the “Company” or “Juniper”) designs, develops, and sells products and services for high-performance networks, to enable customers to build scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility and improved operating efficiency through automation. Juniper challenges the inherent complexity that comes with networking in the multicloud era. Juniper does this with products, solutions and services that transform the way people connect, work and live. Juniper simplifies the process of transitioning to a secure and automated multicloud environment to enable secure, AI-driven networks that connect the world.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements, which include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn December 2023, the Company completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain property and equipment. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company has increased the expected useful life of certain lab equipment from\n3\n-\n5\nyears to\n7\nyears to better reflect the economic value of our assets. The Company considered several factors in making this change, including current and historical usage patterns, as well as expected technology and overall changes in our product roadmap. This change in estimate will be applied prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2024.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, highly liquid investments in money market funds, commercial paper, government securities, certificates of deposits, time deposits, and corporate debt securities, which are readily convertible into cash. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from Juniper's purchase date are classified as cash equivalents.\nInvestments in Available-for-Sale Debt Securities\nThe Company's investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and include the Company's fixed income securities and investments in privately-held companies, consisting of debt and redeemable preferred stock securities.\nFixed income securities primarily consist of corporate debt securities, U.S. treasury securities, time deposits, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, certificate of deposits, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and foreign government debt securities. Fixed income securities are initially recorded at cost and periodically adjusted to fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company periodically evaluates these investments to determine if impairment charges are required. The Company determines whether a credit loss exists for available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. When the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost, the amortized cost will be reduced to its fair value and\n72\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nthe resulting loss will be recorded in Consolidated Statements of Operations, if it is more likely than not that we are required to sell the impaired security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or we have the intention to sell the security. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company considers the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and review of the issuer's financial statements. If factors indicate a credit loss exists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded through other expense, net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.\nThe Company's privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities are included in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recorded at fair value. In determining the estimated fair value of such securities, the Company utilizes the most recent data available for the investee including known acquisition offers and subsequent funding rounds. The Company periodically evaluates these securities for indicators of impairment, including the inability to recover a portion of or the entire carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain earnings, the reduction in or termination of financial commitment to the investee from other investors, the intention to sell the investment, and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. If the Company determines that the decline in an investment's value indicates credit losses, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss in its Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor all available-for-sale debt securities, unrealized gains and the amount of unrealized loss relating to factors other than credit loss are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInvestments in Equity Securities\nThe Company's investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values consist of money market funds, amounts under the non-qualified compensation plan (\"NQDC\") that are invested in mutual funds, and investments in public companies. These investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEquity securities without readily determinable fair values include the Company's investments in privately-held companies consisting of non-redeemable preferred stock and common stock securities. The Company accounts for these securities at cost, adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairments. Fair value of these equity securities is reassessed when the Company identifies observable price changes indicating that an adjustment upward or downward to the carrying value is necessary. Any observable changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as of the date that the observable transaction took place. In addition, the Company periodically evaluates equity securities without readily determinable fair values to determine if impairment charges are required by evaluating whether an event or change in circumstance has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. A qualitative assessment is performed each reporting period to assess whether there are any impairment indicators, including, but not limited to, significant deterioration in the investee's earnings performance; credit rating; asset quality or business prospects; adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment; change in the general market condition of the geographic area or industry; acquisition offers; and the ability to continue as a going concern. If such indicators are present, the Company estimates the fair value of impaired investments and recognizes an impairment loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations equal to the difference between the carrying value and fair value.\nThe Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have control over the investee, under the equity method of accounting. The investment is initially measured at fair value and subsequently adjusted for any impairment, investee capital transactions, dividend received, plus or minus the Company's proportionate share of the equity method investee's income or loss. The Company records its interest in the net earnings or loss of its equity method investment along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions, within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Depending on the timing of such financial statements of the investee, there may be a lag between the timing of such financial statement and the Company's quarter-end date. For the Company's sole equity method investment as of December 31, 2023, the Company's share of the investee's net earnings or loss is recorded\ntwo months\nin arrears. The Company records an impairment when factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable.\n73\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFair Value\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it transacts, and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. These inputs are valued using market-based approaches.\nLevel 3 – Inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assumptions. These inputs, if any, are valued using internal financial models.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward and interest rate contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.\nThe Company uses foreign currency forward contracts or options contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, which are carried at fair value with the derivative's gain or loss initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the costs of services or operating expense line item to which the hedged transaction relates. Cash flows from such hedges are classified as operating activities.\nThe Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re-measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Cash flows from such derivatives are classified as operating activities.\nThe Company uses interest rate swap contracts to convert certain of our fixed interest rate notes to floating interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). All interest rate swap contracts will expire within\nseven years\n. The change in fair value of the derivative instrument substantially offsets the change in the fair value of the hedged item. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.\nThe Company uses interest rate lock contracts, which fix the benchmark interest rates of future debt issuance. The Company records changes in fair value of these contracts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets, in the period of change. When the forecasted transaction occurs, the Company will start to amortize the accumulated gains or losses included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate lock cash flow hedges to interest expense. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to other income and expense within the income statement.\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\n, the Company terminated these interest rate lock contracts. Refer to Note 4,\nDerivative Instruments\n.\nThe Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, under agreements containing provisions on set-off with certain counterparties, subject to applicable requirements, the Company is allowed to net-settle transactions, with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. The Company is neither required to pledge nor entitled to receive cash collateral related to these derivative transactions.\n74\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of component parts to be used in the manufacturing process and finished goods, and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In addition, the Company purchases and holds inventory to provide adequate component supplies over the life of the underlying products. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. A charge is recorded to cost of product when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or considered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in the newly established cost basis.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company evaluates classification of leases as either operating or finance at commencement and, as necessary, at modification. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any finance leases. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets, other accrued liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and excludes lease incentives. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or a rate, are expensed as incurred and are not included within the ROU asset and lease liability calculation. V\nariable lease payments primarily include reimbursements of costs incurred by lessors for common area maintenance and utilities. The Company's lease terms are the noncancelable period, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. At lease inception, and in subsequent periods as necessary, the Company estimates the lease term based on its assessment of extension and termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company does not separate non-lease components from lease components for all underlying classes of assets. In addition, the Company does not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.\nLease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives of the following assets:\n________________________________\n(*)\nEffective January 1, 2024, we increased the expected useful life of certain lab equipment from\n3\n-\n5\nyears to\n7\nyears to better reflect the economic value of our assets.\nLand is not depreciated. Construction-in-process is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe purchase price of an acquired entity is allocated to tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain estimates, such as expected future cash flows, which include consideration of future growth rates and\n75\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nmargins, attrition rates, future changes in technology, discount rates, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. Acquisition related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of acquired businesses from the date of each acquisition.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually on November 1 or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether it is necessary to quantitatively test goodwill for impairment. This initial assessment includes, among others, consideration of macroeconomic conditions and financial performance. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative analysis is performed by determining the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the discounted cash flow and the market approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nIntangible assets consist of existing technology, customer relationships, and trade name, which are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives of\n4\nor\n5\nyears.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, ROU assets, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group, to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. An impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value.\nWarranty Reserves\nThe Company generally offers a\none-year\nwarranty or limited life-time warranty on most of its hardware products, and a\n90\n-day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. Warranty costs are recognized as part of the Company's cost of sales based on associated material costs, logistics costs, labor costs, and overhead at the time revenue is recognized. Material costs are estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period. Labor, logistics, and overhead costs are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support customer cases within the warranty period. Warranty reserve is reported within other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nContract Manufacturer Liabilities\nThe Company establishes a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with its contract manufacturers for carrying charges, quantities in excess of its demand forecasts, or obsolete material charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers to meet the Company’s demand forecast or customer orders. The demand forecasts are based upon historical trends and analysis, adjusted for overall market conditions.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. Management considers the likelihood of loss related to the occurrence of a liability as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.\nForeign Currency\nAssets and liabilities of foreign operations with non-U.S. Dollar functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars using rates that\n76\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\napproximate those in effect during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the stockholders’ equity section as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company remeasures monetary assets and monetary liabilities in non-functional currencies and records the resulting foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price, and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation, as further described below.\nIdentify the contract with a customer\n. The Company generally considers a sales contract and/or agreement with an approved purchase order as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances. The Company combines contracts with a customer if contracts are negotiated with a single commercial substance or contain price dependencies.\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract\n. Product performance obligations include hardware, software licenses including perpetual and term-based licenses, and service performance obligations including maintenance services, Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\"), education and training, and professional services.\nDetermine the transaction price\n. The transaction price for the Company’s contracts with its customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration, provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for rights of return, rebates, and price protection, which are based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria outlined in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. The Company generally invoices customers for hardware, software licenses and related maintenance arrangements at time of delivery, and professional services either upfront or upon meeting certain milestones. Customer invoices are generally due within\n30\nto\n90\ndays after issuance. The Company’s contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. SSP is based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services, pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, and industry technology lifecycles.\nRecognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation\n. Revenue for hardware and certain software licenses, are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Certain software licenses are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the license. Revenue for maintenance services and SaaS is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term. Revenue from education, training, and professional services is recognized as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.\nDeferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to undelivered product commitments and other shipments that have not met revenue recognition criteria. Deferred service revenue represents billed amounts for service contracts, which include technical support, hardware and software maintenance, professional services, SaaS, and education and training, for which services have not been rendered.\nRevenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nSales commissions earned by the Company’s sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. The Company capitalizes these costs, for which the transfer of the goods or services to which the asset relates will occur in future periods. These costs are recorded as prepaid expenses or other long-term assets and are deferred and\n77\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nthen amortized over a period of benefit which is typically over the term of the customer contracts. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nResearch and Development\nCosts to research, design, and develop the Company's products are expensed as incurred.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCapitalization of software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed begins when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ends when a product is available for general release to customers. Generally, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. As a result, costs incurred between achieving technological feasibility and product general availability have not been significant.\nThe Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software systems during the application development stage. Such capitalized costs include external direct costs incurred in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees, who are directly associated with the development of the applications.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred.\nCosts to produce advertising were approximately $\n4.9\nmillion for 2023, and $\n7.4\nmillion for 2022 and 2021. Costs to communicate advertising totaled approximately $\n25.9\nmillion, $\n30.0\nmillion, and $\n26.6\nmillion, for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures and recognizes compensation cost for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options, restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance share awards (\"PSAs\") and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"). For service condition only awards, share-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the underlying awards and amortized on a straight-line basis. For PSAs, share-based compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis for each separate vesting portion of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe Company utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its ESPP purchase rights. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions that represent management's best estimates of volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividend yield. The Company estimates expected volatility based on the implied volatility of market-traded options, on the Company's common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company’s ESPP. The expected life of ESPP purchase rights approximates the offering period.\nThe Company determines the grant date fair value of its RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, adjusted by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares of common stock during the requisite and derived service period as these awards are not entitled to receive dividends until vested.\nFor market-based RSUs, the Company estimates the fair value and derived service period using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model (\"Monte Carlo model\"). The determination of the grant date fair value and derived service periods using the Monte Carlo model is affected by the Company's stock price, comparative market-based returns, as well as various highly subjective assumptions that represent management's best estimates of volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The Company estimates expected volatility based on the implied volatility of market-traded options, on the Company's common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors, including historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the contractual life of the Company's market-based RSUs.\n78\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nProvision for Income Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes. The Company accounts for the current impacts of U.S. tax on certain foreign subsidiaries income, which is referred to as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, in the year earned.\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives, and accounts receivable. The Company invests only in high-quality credit instruments and maintains its cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments in fixed income securities with several high-quality institutions. Deposits held with banks, including those held in foreign branches of global banks, may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. We mitigate the concentration of credit risk in our investment portfolio through diversification of the investments in various industries and asset classes, and limits to the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer and credit rating.\nThe Company’s derivatives expose it to credit risk to the extent that counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. The Company has a risk assessment and mitigation framework to evaluate the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk. As part of this risk mitigation framework, the Company transacts with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and also enters into master netting agreements, which permit net settlement of the transactions with the same counterparty. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. Therefore, the Company does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties.\nGenerally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across different geographic locations throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues.\nThe Company relies on sole suppliers for certain critical components such as application-specific integrated circuits. Additionally, the Company relies primarily on a limited number of significant independent contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers for the production of its products. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could negatively impact future operating results.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures:\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its disclosures.\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures:\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which expands the disclosures required for income taxes. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis while retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its disclosures.\n79\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 2. Cash Equivalents and Investments\nInvestments in Available-for-Sale Debt Securities\nThe following table summarizes the Company's unrealized gains and losses and fair value of investments designated as available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in millions):\nThe following table presents the contractual maturities of the Company's total fixed income securities as of December 31, 2023 (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had an unrea\nlized loss of $\n1.9\nmillion from\n93\nfixed income available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months.\nThe gross unrealized losses related to these investments were primarily due to changes in market interest rates. The Company anticipates that it will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such available-for-sale debt securities and has determined that\nno\nallowance for credit losses was required to be recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an allowance for credit loss of $\n8.3\nmillion on privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock investments. The unrealized loss represents the difference between the estimated fair\n80\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nvalue and the cost of the investment. The determination of fair value was based on quantitative and qualitative analysis including factors such as the near-term prospects of the investee in the market in which it operates and evaluating the investee’s financial condition in relation to its outstanding obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were\nno\nunrealized losses related to Company's privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock investments.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had\nno\nmaterial gross realized gains or losses from available-for-sale debt securities.

The unrealized losses represent the difference between the estimated fair values and the carrying values of equity investments without readily determinable fair value. The Company estimated the fair value of these investments based on quantitative and qualitative analysis. This analysis involved use of judgment, significant estimates and assumptions, such as the near-term prospects of the investee in the market in which it operates, evaluating the investee’s financial condition in relation to its outstanding obligations, and probabilities of securing additional capital through various alternative scenarios. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were\nno\nmaterial unrealized gains or losses recognized for equity investments without readily determinable fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's ownership in the investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting represented approximately\n24.1\n%\nand\n25.0\n%, respectively.

These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges for a forecasted debt issuance which was expected to occur by the end of 2025\n. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023\n, the Company terminated the interest rate lock contracts, resulting in a deferred gain of $\n133.9\nmillion recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, which will be deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the anticipated debt unless it becomes probable that the debt will not be issued with the terms anticipated at the hedge's inception. The Company classifies the cash flow in the same section as the underlying item resulting in the proceeds from sale being presented as operating activities.\nEffect of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations\nFor cash flow hedges, the Company recognized an\nunrealized gain of $\n15.1\nmillion\n, unrealized gain of $\n33.1\nmillion and unrealized loss of $\n9.1\nmillion in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the effective portion of its derivative instruments during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nFor foreign currency contracts, the Company\nreclassified a loss of $\n29.8\nmillion, a loss of\n$\n25.8\nmillion and a gain of $\n28.9\nmillion out of accumulated other comprehensive loss to cost of revenues and operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Until vested, RSUs and PSAs do not have the voting and dividend participation rights of common stock and the shares underlying the awards are not considered issued and outstanding.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s RSU, RSA, and PSA activity and related information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (in millions, except per share amounts and years):\n________________________________\n(1)\nIncludes\n7.8\nmillion service-based,\n1.4\nmillion performance-based, and\n0.4\nmillion market-based awards. The number of shares subject to performance-based and market-based conditions represents the aggregate maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the award over its full term. The grant date fair value of RSUs and PSAs was reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares of common stock during the requisite and derived service period as these awards are not entitled to receive dividends until vested.\n(2)\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs granted and assumed or substituted during 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $\n28.88\n, $\n29.62\n, and $\n26.21\n, respectively. The grant date fair value of RSUs and PSAs was reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares of common stock during the requisite and derived service period as these awards are not entitled to receive dividends until vested. During 2023, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.22\nper share of common stock on January 31, 2023, April 25, 2023, July 27, 2023, and October 26, 2023.\n(3)\nTotal fair value of RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs vested during 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $\n206.8\nmillion, $\n202.2\nmillion, and $\n184.2\nmillion, respectively.\nShares Available for Grant\nThe following table presents the stock activity and the total number of shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan (in millions):\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nDuring 2023, 2022, and 2021, employees purchased\n2.6\nmillion,\n2.6\nmillion, and\n2.8\nmillion shares of common stock through the ESPP at an average exercise price of $\n23.53\n, $\n21.59\n, and $\n19.81\nper share, respectively.\n98\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nValuation Assumptions\nThe weighted-average assumptions used and the resulting estimates of fair value for ESPP purchase rights and market-based RSUs were as follows:\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nShare-based compensation expense associated with stock options, RSUs, RSAs, PSAs, and ESPP purchase rights was recorded in the following cost and expense categories in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):\nThe following table summarizes share-based compensation expense by award type (in millions):\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized tax benefits on total stock-based compensation expense, which are reflected in the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, of $\n36.9\nmillion, $\n25.7\nmillion, and $\n28.2\nmillion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the realized tax benefit related to awards vested or exercised during the period was $\n34.4\nmillion, $\n38.6\nmillion, and $\n31.7\nmillion, respectively. These amounts do not include the indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the research and development tax credit.\n99\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based awards was $\n383.4\nmillion to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.8\nyears.\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company maintains a savings and retirement plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"IRC\"). Employees meeting the eligibility requirements, as defined under the IRC, may contribute up to the statutory limits each year. The Company currently matches\n30\n% of all eligible employee contributions which vest immediately. The Company’s matching contributions to the plan totaled $\n27.3\nmillion, $\n23.5\nmillion, and $\n22.3\nmillion during 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nThe Company’s NQDC plan is an unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation arrangement. Under the NQDC plan, officers and other senior employees may elect to defer a portion of their compensation and contribute such amounts to one or more investment funds. As of December 31, 2023, the liability of the Company to the plan participants was $\n38.0\nmillion, of which $\n2.5\nmillion was included within other accrued liabilities and $\n35.5\nmillion was included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had investments of $\n38.0\nmillion correlating to the deferred compensation obligations, of which $\n2.5\nmillion was included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and $\n35.5\nmillion was included within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the liability of the Company was $\n28.1\nmillion, of which $\n2.4\nmillion was included within other accrued liabilities and $\n25.7\nmillion was included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had investments of $\n28.1\nmillion correlating to the deferred compensation obligations, of which $\n2.4\nmillion was included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and $\n25.7\nmillion was included within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n100\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 11. Segments\nThe Company operates in\none\nreportable segment. The Company's chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance, accompanied by disaggregated information about net revenues by customer solution, customer vertical, and geographic region as presented below.\nThe following table presents net revenues by customer solution (in millions):\nThe following table presents net revenues by customer vertical\n(in millions):\nThe Company attributes revenues to geographic region based on the customer’s shipping address. The following table presents net revenues by geographic region (in millions):\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's net revenues.\nThe following table presents geographic information for property and equipment, net (in millions).\nThe Company tracks assets by physical location. The majority of the Company’s assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents and investments, as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were attributable to U.S. operations.\n101\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 12. Income Taxes\nThe components of pretax income are summarized as follows (in millions):\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes is summarized as follows (in millions):\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory tax rate of 21% to pretax income for each of the years presented as follows (in millions):\nIn 2023, classified within \"Other\" above, the Company recorded a tax expense of $\n9.8\nmillion on adjustments for certain privately-held investments and $\n5.0\nmillion related to interest on income tax reserves. This was partially offset by income tax benefits of $\n10.9\nmillion due to changes in tax legislation.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carry-forward items and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred income taxes are classified as other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSignificant components of the Company's long-term deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows (in millions):\n102\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance on its U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets of $\n326.9\nmillion and $\n310.9\nmillion, respectively. The balance at December 31, 2023 consisted of $\n5.2\nmillion, $\n312.9\nmillion, and $\n8.8\nmillion against the Company's U.S. federal, state, and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively, which the Company believes are not more likely than not to be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance increased in 2023 and 2022 by $\n16\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion, respectively, primarily related to changes in state R&D tax credits.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal, California and other states net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $\n104.3\nmillion, $\n129.1\nmillion, and $\n138.8\nmillion, respectively. The California net operating loss carry-forwards of $\n129.1\nmillion are expected to expire unused. The Company also had federal, California, and other state tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $\n2.4\nmillion, $\n326.7\nmillion, and $\n32.8\nmillion, respectively. Unused net operating loss and other state tax credit carry-forwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year 2024. The California tax credit carry-forwards will carry forward indefinitely.\nThe Company provides deferred tax liabilities for all tax consequences associated with the undistributed earnings that are expected to be repatriated to subsidiaries' parent unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. The Company has made no provision for deferred taxes on approximately $\n156.7\nmillion of cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2023. These earnings are considered indefinitely invested in operations of the subsidiaries, as the Company intends to utilize these amounts to fund future expansion of its operations. If these earnings were distributed to the parent, the Company would be subject to additional taxes of approximately $\n31.7\nmillion.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $\n132.8\nmillion, $\n116.0\nmillion, and $\n113.4\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $\n127.8\nmillion of the gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate before considering valuation allowance.\n103\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the Company's total gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $\n12.0\nmillion, $\n5.6\nmillion, and $\n8.1\nmillion, respectively, as other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the changes in the level of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the Company recognized a (benefit), or expense, for net interest and penalties of $\n6.3\nmillion, $(\n2.5\n) million, and $\n2.7\nmillion in its Consolidated Statements of Operations during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. There is a greater than remote likelihood that the balance of the gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $\n49.9\nmillion within the next twelve months due to the completion of tax review cycles in various tax jurisdictions and lapses of applicable statutes of limitation.\nThe Company conducts business globally and, as a result, Juniper Networks or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such jurisdictions as the Netherlands, U.K., France, Germany, Japan, China, Australia, India, and the U.S. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2012.\nThe Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the India tax authorities for the 2017 through 2018 tax years and the 2012 through 2020 tax years, respectively. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations. As of December 31, 2023, the Company believes the resolution of the audits is unlikely to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is pursuing all available administrative remedies relative to ongoing matters. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to proposed adjustments and the ultimate resolution of these matters is unlikely to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations; however, there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of these matters could have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\n104\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 13. Net Income per Share\nThe Company computed basic and diluted net income per share as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nBasic net income per share is computed using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and purchase rights, and vesting of RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs. The Company includes the common shares underlying PSAs in the calculation of diluted net income per share only when they become contingently issuable. Anti-dilutive shares are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share.\n105\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nUnconditional purchase obligations consist of agreements that include firm and non-cancelable terms to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum amounts or quantities to be purchased at fixed or minimum prices. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the following tables were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\nIn order to reduce manufacturing lead times and in the interest of having access to adequate component supply, the Company enters into agreements with contract manufacturers and certain suppliers to procure inventory based on the Company's requirements. A significant portion of the Company's purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm and non-cancelable commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust its requirements based on the Company's business needs prior to firm orders being placed.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s purchase commitments as of December 31, 2023 (in millions):\nThe Company establishes a liability in connection with purchase commitments related to quantities in excess of its demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on the Company’s demand forecast or customer orders. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued $\n36.0\nmillion related to such charges.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s unconditional purchase obligations other than with contract manufacturers and suppliers as of December 31, 2023 (in millions):\nIn December 2018, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement and certain Statements of Work, as subsequently amended (collectively, the “Agreement”), with International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"). As of December 31, 2023, the Company expects to pay IBM $\n56.3\nmillion over the remaining initial term of the Agreement. The table above does not include fees payable to IBM under the contract as the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount of the payments related to each of the years under this contract due to uncertainties in the usage of the services.\n106\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nLeases\nThe Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that have remaining lease terms of\n1\nto\n8\nyears and\n1\nto\n4\nyears, respectively. Each leased facility is subject to an individual lease or sublease, which could provide various options to extend or terminate the lease agreement. Facilities are primarily comprised of corporate offices, data centers, and R&D facilities. Equipment includes vehicles and various office equipment. The Company also has variable lease payments that are primarily comprised of common area maintenance and utility charges. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nThe components of lease costs and other information related to leases were as follows (in millions, except years and percentages):\nAs of December 31, 2023, future operating lease payments for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions):\n107\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nDebt and Interest Payment on Debt\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company held total outstanding debt consisting of the Notes with a carrying value of $\n1,616.8\nmillion. See Note 8,\nDebt and Financing\n, for further discussion of the Company's long-term debt and expected future principal maturities.\nTax Liability\nOur transition tax liability represents future cash payments on accumulated foreign earnings of subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Act\"). The Company has elected to pay its transition tax, net of applicable tax refunds, over the\neight-year\nperiod provided in the Tax Act. The remaining balance of the Company's transition tax obligation was $\n179.7\nmillion, of which $\n106.3\nmillion remains in long-term income taxes payable as of December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company also had $\n92.7\nmillion included in long-term income taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.\nGuarantees\nThe Company has financial guarantees consisting of third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities, insurance programs and customs of $\n32.5\nmillion and $\n27.4\nmillion, as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in investigations, disputes, litigation, and legal proceedings. The Company records an accrual for loss contingencies for legal proceedings when it believes that an unfavorable outcome is both (a) probable and (b) the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable. The Company intends to aggressively defend itself in these matters, and while there can be no assurances and the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company currently believes that these existing claims or proceedings are not likely, individually and in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these matters or other third-party claims against the Company may cause the Company to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require the Company to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company's estimates, if any, which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses.\n108\nNote 15. Subsequent Events\nDividend Declaration\nOn January 30, 2024, the Company announced a cash dividend of $\n0.22\nper share of common stock to be paid on March 22, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2024.\nMerger Agreement\nOn January 9, 2024, HPE and Juniper Networks, Inc. announced that the companies entered into a definitive Merger Agreement under which HPE will acquire Juniper in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of this agreement, Juniper shareholders will receive $\n40.00\nper share in cash upon the completion of the transaction, representing an equity value of approximately $\n14\nbillion. The transaction is currently expected to close in late calendar year 2024 or early calendar year 2025, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, approval of the transaction by Juniper shareholders, and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\n109"
