    "text": "We are the largest publicly traded lodging REIT, with a geographically diverse portfolio of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 23, 2024, our consolidated lodging portfolio consists of 77 primarily luxury and upper-upscale hotels containing approximately 42,000 rooms, with substantially all located in the United States (five of the hotels are located outside of the U.S. in Brazil and Canada). In addition, we own non-controlling interests in seven domestic and one international joint ventures that focus on the lodging industry, see \" - Other Real Estate Interests\" for a further description.\nHost Inc. was incorporated as a Maryland corporation in 1998 and operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT. Host Inc. owns hotels and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of the partnership interests (“OP units”) as of December 31, 2023. The remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.’s day-to-day management and control.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur goal is to be the preeminent owner of high-quality lodging real estate in growing markets in the U.S. and to generate superior long-term risk adjusted returns for our stockholders throughout all phases of the lodging cycle through a combination of appreciation in asset values, growth in earnings and the payment of dividends. The pillars of our strategy to achieve this objective and elevate our growth profile include:\n•\nGeographically diverse portfolio of hotels in the\nU.S. - Own a diversified portfolio of hotels in the U.S. in major urban and resort destinations. Target markets with diverse demand generators, high barriers to entry, favorable supply and demand dynamics and attractive long-term projected RevPAR growth;\n1\n•\nStrong scale and integrated platform\n- Utilize our scale to create value through enterprise analytics, asset management and capital investment initiatives, while aiding external growth by leveraging scale as a competitive advantage to acquire assets befitting our strategy. Allocate and recycle capital to seek returns that exceed our cost of capital and actively return capital to stockholders;\n•\nInvestment grade balance sheet\n- Maintain a strong and flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout all phases of the lodging cycle; and\n•\nEmployer of choice and responsible corporate citizen\n- Align our organizational structure with our business objectives to be an employer of choice and a responsible corporate citizen.\nGeographically Diverse Portfolio\nWe seek to have a geographically diversified portfolio in major markets and premier resort destinations in the U.S. We primarily focus on acquisitions and, occasionally, new development opportunities to enhance our portfolio. While we have historically targeted acquisitions in the top 25 U.S. markets, we also consider hotels in other markets, which we believe have high growth potential and diverse demand generators. We focus generally on the following types of assets:\n•\nResorts\nin destination locations with limited supply growth. These assets feature superior amenities and unique experiential offerings;\n•\nConvention destination hotels\nthat are group oriented in urban and resort markets. These assets feature extensive and high-quality meeting facilities and often are connected to prominent convention centers; and\n•\nHigh-end urban hotels\nthat are positioned in prime locations and possess multiple demand drivers for both business and leisure travelers.\nAs one of the largest owners of Marriott and Hyatt hotels, our hotels primarily are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Within these brands, we have focused predominantly on the upper-upscale and luxury chain scales, as we believe these have a broad appeal for both individual and group leisure and business customers. In addition, we own several unbranded or soft-branded hotels that appeal to distinctive customer profiles in certain submarkets.\nStrong Scale and Integrated Platform\nEnterprise Analytics Platform.\nDue to the scale of our asset management and business intelligence platform, we believe we are in a unique position to implement value-added real estate decisions and to assist our managers in improving operating performance and profitability. The size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading brands and operators in the industry allow our enterprise analytics team to benchmark similar hotels and identify revenue-enhancement opportunities and cost efficiencies that can maximize the operating performance, long-term profitability and value of our real estate. We perform independent underwriting of return on investment (“ROI”) projects and potential acquisitions, as well as revenue management analysis of ancillary revenue opportunities. Our goal is to continue to differentiate our hotels within their competitive markets, drive operating performance and enhance the overall value of our real estate through the following:\n•\nEnhance operating performance and profitability by using our business intelligence system to benchmark and monitor hotel performance and cost controls.\n•\nDrive revenue growth by conducting detailed strategic reviews with our managers on markets and business mix to assist them in developing the appropriate group/transient mix, online presence to address a broad customer base, and market share targets for each hotel.\n•\nWork with leading brands, such as Marriott and Hyatt, to take advantage of their worldwide presence and lodging infrastructure. We also have a selection of hotels managed by independent operators where we believe these operators have more flexibility to drive revenues and control costs to maximize profits.\n2\n•\nImprove asset value through the extension or purchase of ground leases or the restructuring of management agreements to increase contract flexibility.\nDisciplined Capital Allocation.\nGuided by a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we are equipped to make investment decisions that seek to deliver the greatest value and returns to stockholders. Our goal is to allocate capital to enhance and improve our portfolio, while balancing the importance of prudently returning capital to stockholders.\nFor 2024, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation and intend to take advantage of our strong balance sheet and overall scale. We are constantly evaluating potential acquisitions of iconic upper-upscale and luxury properties that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages. Similarly, we intend to continue our capital recycling program with strategic and opportunistic dispositions. This may include the sale of assets where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or hotels with significant capital expenditure requirements that we do not believe would generate an adequate return.\nWe may acquire additional properties or dispose of properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders. We anticipate that any acquisitions may be funded by, or through a combination of, proceeds from the sales of hotels, equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., incurrence of debt, available cash or advances under our credit facility. We note, however, that the nature and supply of these assets make acquisitions inherently difficult to predict. For these reasons, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in purchasing any one or more hotels that we are reviewing currently, or may in the future review, bid on or negotiate to buy.\nWe also seek to create\nand mine value from our existing portfolio through value enhancement initiatives and ROI projects. We believe these investments provide a significant opportunity to achieve returns well in excess of our cost of capital. We work closely with our managers to attempt to schedule these projects to minimize operational disruption and environmental impact. Value enhancement initiatives seek to maximize the value of real estate within our existing portfolio through its highest and best use. These projects may include hotel expansion, timeshare, office space or condominium units on excess land, redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space, and the acquisition of development entitlements. ROI projects are designed to improve the positioning of our hotels within their markets and competitive set. These projects include extensive renovations, including guest rooms, lobbies, food and beverage outlets; expansions and/or extensive renovation of ballroom and meeting rooms; major mechanical system upgrades; and green building initiatives and certifications. Also included are projects focused on increasing space profitability or lowering net operating costs, such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space, adding guestrooms, and implementing energy and water conservation measures such as LED lighting, high-efficiency mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment and fixtures, solar power, energy management systems, guestroom water efficient fixtures, and building automation systems.\nRenewal and replacement capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels. Typically, renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven to ten years, but the timing may vary based on the type of property, function of area being renovated, hotel occupancy and other factors. These renovations generally are divided into the following types: soft goods, case goods, bathroom and architectural and engineering systems. Soft goods include items such as carpeting, textiles and wall finishes, which may require more frequent updates to maintain brand quality standards. Case goods include dressers, desks, couches, restaurant and meeting room tables and chairs, which generally are not replaced as frequently. Bathroom renovations include the refurbishment or replacement of tile, vanity, lighting and plumbing fixtures. Architectural and engineering systems include the physical plant of the hotel, including the roof, elevators/escalators, façade, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and fire systems.\nThroughout the lodging cycle, to the extent that we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities that meet our return requirements, we will focus on returning capital to stockholders through dividends or common stock repurchases. Significant factors we review to determine the level and timing of the returns to stockholders include our current stock price compared to our determination of the underlying value of our assets, current and forecast operating results and the completion of hotel sales.\nInvestment Grade Balance Sheet\nOur goal is to maintain a flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout the lodging cycle. To maintain its qualification as a REIT, Host Inc. is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) to its stockholders each year and, as a result, generally relies on external sources of capital, as well as cash from operations, to finance growth.\n3\nManagement believes that a\nstrong balance sheet\nis a key competitive advantage that affords us a lower cost of debt and positions us for external growth. While we may issue debt at any time, we will target a net debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio, (or “Leverage Ratio,” as defined in our credit facility) that allows us to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. We believe an investment grade rating will give us the most consistent access to capital throughout the business cycle.\nWe seek to structure our debt profile to\nmaintain financial flexibility and a staggered maturity schedule\nwith access to different forms of financing, consisting primarily of senior notes and exchangeable debentures, as well as mortgage debt. Generally, we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt, minimize near-term maturities and maintain a staggered maturity schedule. Depending on market conditions, we also may utilize variable rate debt which can provide greater protection during a decline in the lodging industry.\nCorporate Responsibility\nWe are committed to creating long-term value through investing responsibly in our business, environment, people and community. Our Corporate Responsibility (\"CR\") program is centered around the concept of responsible investment—an overarching strategy that guides our focus and actions across our three main themes of Environmental Stewardship, Social Responsibility and Governance.\nWe believe that a disciplined and proactive approach to addressing critical environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics enables us to create long-term value for our stockholders and helps us to optimize our portfolio and human capital investments, while maintaining our position as a sustainability leader in the lodging REIT sector. Our management approach is driven by people, culture, policies, targets and performance monitoring to improve the value from our investments of time, talent and financial resources. This approach directly supports Host’s business strategy and goals.\n•\nEnvironmental Stewardship\n: We are investing in solutions that conserve and restore natural capital to assist us in mitigating climate change and biodiversity impacts with the goal of achieving best-in-class returns.\n•\nSocial Responsibility\n: We are committed to advancing health, well-being and opportunity for all of our stakeholders, including investors, employees, partners and communities.\n•\nGovernance\n: Our responsible investment strategies are guided by executive and board-level oversight, our EPIC values of Excellence, Partnership, Integrity and Community, our ethical standards, and a disciplined approach to risk management and sustainable value creation.\nThe Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) (now maintained by the International Sustainability Standards Board under the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) outlines the disclosure topics and accounting metrics for the real estate industry. The energy and water management metrics that best correlate with our industry include total energy consumed (“Total Energy Consumption”) and total water withdrawn (“Total Water Consumption”). The energy and water data we use is collected and reviewed by third parties who compile the data from property utility statements.\nThe charts below detail our third-party verified Total Energy Consumption and Total Water Consumption for 2020 through 2022, the last three fiscal years for which data is available\n(1)\n. The increases in Total Energy Consumption and Total Water Consumption for 2021 and 2022 reflect the return of business at our hotels as compared to the loss of occupancy from the COVID-19 pandemic in prior years:\n4\n___________\n(1)\nEnergy and water metrics relate to our consolidated hotels owned for the entire year presented.\nOur latest Corporate Responsibility Report, which was issued in September 2023, details our CR program and responsible investment strategy; along with our environmental, social and governance performance and our new 2030 environmental and social targets that will serve as the initial roadmap for achieving our aspirational vision of becoming net positive by 2050. The Corporate Responsibility Report also includes Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and full SASB disclosures, as well as an EEO-1 report. The contents of our Corporate Responsibility Report are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and do not form a part of this Form 10-K.\nThe Lodging Industry\nThe lodging industry in the United States consists of private and public entities that operate in a diversified market under a variety of brand names. The lodging industry has several key participants:\n•\nOwners\n—own the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel. These hotels may be branded and operated under the manager’s brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager. The hotels also may be operated as an independent hotel by an independent hotel manager.\n•\nOwner/Managers\n—own the hotel and operate the property with their own management team. These hotels may be branded under a franchise agreement, operated as an independent hotel or operated under the owner’s brand. We are prohibited from operating and managing hotels by applicable REIT rules.\n•\nFranchisors\n—own a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system. Franchisors provide their hotels with brand recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems for the franchised hotels.\n•\nFranchisor/Managers\n—own a brand or brands and operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee.\n•\nManagers\n—operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner, but do not, themselves, own a brand. The hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an independent hotel.\nThe hotel manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the hotel, including the employment of hotel staff, the determination of room rates, the development of sales and marketing plans, the preparation of operating and capital expenditures budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner. The hotel manager typically receives fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel.\nSupply and Demand.\nOur industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms. Lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy, in addition to local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations. Trends in economic indicators such as gross domestic product\n5\n(“GDP”) growth, business investment, corporate profits and employment growth are key indicators of the relative strength of lodging demand. Lodging demand also will be affected by changes to international travel patterns.\nLodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand, as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development. However, the rate of supply growth also is influenced by several additional factors, including the availability of capital, interest rates, construction costs and unique market considerations. The relatively long lead-time required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry, as new supply may be planned during an upcycle but such supply may open for business in a weaker economy. Therefore, as illustrated in the charts below for the U.S. lodging industry, at different points in the cycle, demand growth may accelerate when supply growth is very low, or supply may accelerate while demand growth is slowing. Online short-term rentals are a source of non-traditional supply for the industry, in both urban and resort destinations, including as a flexible option for apartment buildings and vacation homes. Though not reported through official industry statistics, the impact on the hotel industry and the availability of these outlets is more variable than typical changes in supply from hotel construction and tends to be very market specific. Local legislation has the potential to limit supply growth for these online short-term rentals in many top markets, though the growth of professional management for legal rentals remains a key trend.\nOur portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale and luxury hotels and, accordingly, its performance is best understood in comparison to the luxury and upper upscale categories rather than the entire industry. The charts below detail the historical supply, demand and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) growth for the U.S. lodging industry and for the U.S. luxury and upper upscale categories for 2018 to 2023.\nU.S. Lodging Industry Supply, Demand and RevPAR Growth\n6\nU.S. Luxury and Upper Upscale Supply, Demand and RevPAR Growth\nOur Customers.\nOur customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business. Similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows:\nTransient business broadly represents individual business and/or leisure travelers. Historically, business travelers have made up the majority of transient demand at our hotels; however, leisure drove the majority of our demand during the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 through 2022, with business transient seeing a recovery in the second half of 2022 and through 2023. The four key subcategories of rates offered to the transient business group are:\n•\nRetail:\nThis is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the public. It typically is the rate charged to travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates. It includes the “rack rate,” which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available. Retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g., seasonality and weekday vs. weekend stays).\n•\nNon-Qualified Discount:\nThis category includes special rates offered by the hotels, including packages, advance-purchase discounts and promotional offers. It also includes rooms booked through online travel agencies (OTAs).\n•\nSpecial Corporate\n: This is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally. These rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate. In addition, this category includes rates offered at the prevailing per diem for approved government travel.\n•\nQualified Discount\n: This category encompasses all discount programs, such as AAA and AARP discounts, rooms booked through wholesale channels, frequent guest program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel.\nGroup business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of 10 rooms. The three key sub-categories of the group business category are:\n•\nAssociation\n: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions.\n•\nCorporate\n: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations).\n•\nOther\n: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as SMERF business.\n7\nContract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period at significantly discounted rates. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels. Contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand.\nManagers and Operational Agreements\nAll our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements, with some of such hotels also subject to separate franchise or license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operations under the designated brand. Under these agreements, the managers have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, securing and processing reservations, procuring inventories, supplies and services, providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers’ technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels. The managers employ all managerial and other employees for the hotels, review hotel operations with a focus on improving revenues and managing expenses, review the maintenance of the hotels, prepare reports, budgets and projections, and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels. These support services include planning and policy services, divisional financial services, product planning and development, employee staffing and training, corporate executive management and certain in-house legal services. We have certain approval rights over budgets, capital expenditures, significant leases and contractual commitments, and various other matters.\nGeneral Terms and Provisions\n– Agreements governing our hotels that are managed by brand owners (Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, Four Seasons and AccorHotels) typically include the terms described below:\n•\nTerm and fees for operational services\n. The initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is 10 to 25 years, with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager. The majority of our management agreements condition the manager’s right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria. The manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee, which is calculated as a percentage (generally 2-3%) of annual gross revenues, and an incentive management fee, which typically is calculated as a percentage (generally 10-20%) of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel. In the case of our hotels operating under the W®, Westin®, Sheraton®, Luxury Collection® and St. Regis® brands and managed by Marriott following its acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. on September 23, 2016 (collectively, the “Starwood Hotels”), the base management fee is only 1% of annual gross revenues, but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable under a separate license agreement (as described below).\n•\nLicense services\n. In the case of the Starwood Hotels, operations are governed by separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand, including rights to use trademarks, service marks and logos, matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies, and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services. Although the term of these license agreements generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating agreements, the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement (for instance, in the event the hotel is operated by an independent operator). Licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees (generally 5% of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2% of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales), which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1% of gross revenues received by Marriott under the operating agreements, as noted above.\n•\nChain or system programs and services\n. Managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis. Such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services, regional or other centralized management and administrative services, marketing and sales programs and services, training and other personnel services, and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized, regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services.\n•\nWorking capital and fixed asset supplies\n. We are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies (for example, linen, china, glassware, silver and uniforms). We also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the\n8\nfunds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels. For certain hotels, the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis, with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements.\n•\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment replacements\n. We are required to provide the managers with all furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”) necessary for the operation of the hotels (including funding any required FF&E replacements). On an annual basis, the managers prepare budgets for FF&E to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds, which budgets are subject to our review and approval. For purposes of funding such expenditures, a specified percentage (typically 4-5%) of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name, to which the manager has access. For certain hotels, we have negotiated flexibility with the manager that reduces the funding commitment required as follows:\n◦\nFor certain of our Marriott-managed hotels, we have entered into an agreement with Marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account, rather than periodic reserve fund contributions being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each of the subject hotels, with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly less than the amount that would have been maintained otherwise in such separate hotel reserve accounts. Upon sale, a hotel-level reserve account would be funded (either by the purchaser or by us, as the seller) in the full amount of the reserve balance associated with the subject hotel.\n◦\nFor certain of the Starwood Hotels, periodic reserve fund contributions, which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers at each hotel, are distributed to us and we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels. Upon sale, a hotel-level reserve account would be funded in the amount of the subject hotel’s pro rata share, if any, of the consolidated pooled reserve balance.\n•\nBuilding alterations, improvements and renewals\n. The managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and elevators of each hotel, along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required, in the manager’s reasonable judgment, to keep the hotel in a competitive, efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards. We generally have approval rights over such budgets and expenditures, which we review and approve based on our manager’s recommendations and on our judgment. Expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners, although our agreements with Marriott in respect of the Starwood Hotels contemplate that certain such expenditures also may be funded from the FF&E reserve account.\n•\nTreatment of additional owner funding\n. As additional owner funding becomes necessary, either for expenditures generally funded from the FF&E replacement funds, or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners, most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers. One approach frequently utilized at some of our Marriott-managed hotels (excluding the Starwood Hotels) is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid, with interest, from operational revenues, with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees. Another approach that is used at the Starwood Hotels, as well as with certain capital expenditures projects at some of our other hotels, is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel, resulting in an increase to the owner’s priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees. For the hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above, the amount of any additional FF&E reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis, determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year.\n9\n•\nTerritorial protections\n. Certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning, operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area. The area restrictions vary with each hotel, from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multi-mile radius from the hotel in other areas.\n•\nSale of the hotel\n. Subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels (see below under “Special Termination Rights”), we generally are limited in our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer such hotels by the requirement that the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions, including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager.\n•\nPerformance Termination Rights.\nIn addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager, most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights for us to terminate on the basis of the manager’s failure to meet certain performance-based metrics, typically including a specified threshold return on the owner’s investment in the hotel, along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified RevPAR performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market. Typically, such performance-based termination rights arise in the event the manager fails to achieve these specified performance thresholds over a consecutive two-year period and are subject to the manager’s ability to “cure” and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts (or, in some instances, waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees). We have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates, which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements.\n•\nSpecial Termination Rights.\nIn addition to any performance-based or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements, we have specific negotiated termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements. While the brand affiliation of a hotel may increase its value, the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement, or even brand affiliation, also can increase the value for prospective purchasers. These termination rights can take several different forms, including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement; termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation; or termination without sale or other conditions, which may require the payment of a fee.\nIn addition to hotels managed by brand owners, we have both branded hotels and non-branded hotels operated by independent managers. Our management agreements with independent managers, while similar in operational scope to agreements with our brand managers, typically have shorter initial terms, no renewal rights, more flexible termination rights, and more limited system-wide services. However, while we have additional flexibility with respect to these operators, certain of those hotels remain subject to underlying franchise or licensing agreements. These franchise or licensing agreements allow us to engage independent managers to operate our hotels under the applicable brand names and to participate in the brands’ reservation and loyalty-rewards systems. Under these agreements, we pay the brand owners a franchise or licensing fee equal to a specified percentage of gross room revenues, as well as other system fees and reimbursements. In addition, we are obligated to maintain applicable brand standards at our franchised hotels.\nOperating Structure\nHost Inc. operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all its assets are owned by Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and holds approximately 99% of the OP units as of December 31, 2023. A REIT is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that meets certain ownership, organizational and operating requirements set forth under the Code. In general, by payments of dividends to stockholders, a REIT is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level. Each OP unit owned by unaffiliated limited partners other than Host Inc. is redeemable, at the option of the limited partner, for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of Host Inc. common stock multiplied by the current conversion factor of 1.021494. Host Inc. has the right to acquire any OP unit offered for redemption directly from the limited partner in exchange for 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock instead of Host L.P. redeeming such OP unit for cash. Additionally, for every share of common stock issued by Host Inc., Host L.P. will issue .97895 OP units to Host Inc. in exchange for the consideration received from the issuance of the common stock. As of December 31, 2023, unaffiliated limited partners owned 9.5 million OP units, which were convertible into 9.7 million Host Inc. common shares.\n10\nAssuming that all OP units held by unaffiliated limited partners were converted into common shares, there would have been 713.3 million common shares of Host Inc. outstanding at December 31, 2023.\nOur operating structure is as follows:\nAs a REIT, certain tax laws limit the amount of “non-qualifying” income that Host Inc. and Host L.P. can earn, including income derived directly from the operation of hotels. As a result, we lease substantially all our consolidated hotels to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) for federal income tax purposes. Our TRS are subject to federal and state corporate income tax and are not limited as to the amount of non-qualifying income they can generate, but they are limited in terms of their value as a percentage of the total value of our assets. Our TRS enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels. Our TRS also may own assets engaging in activities that produce non-qualifying income, such as the development of timeshare or condominium units and the generation of asset management fees, subject to certain restrictions. The difference between the hotels’ net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to Host L.P. is retained or incurred by our TRS as taxable income or loss. Accordingly, the net effect of the TRS leases is that a portion of the net operating cash flow from our hotels is subject to federal, state and, if applicable, foreign corporate income tax.\nOur Consolidated Hotel Portfolio\nAs of February 23, 2024, we owned a portfolio of 77 hotels, of which 72 are in the United States and five are located in Brazil and Canada. Our consolidated hotels located outside the United States collectively have approximately 1,500 rooms. Approximately 2% of our revenues in 2023, and approximately 1% of our revenues in both 2022 and 2021 were attributed to the operations of these five foreign hotels.\nThe lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different categories, each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs: luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper midscale, midscale and economy. Our portfolio primarily consists of luxury and upper upscale properties, which are operated under internationally recognized brand names such as Marriott, Westin, Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt, Four Seasons and Hilton. There are also specialized, smaller boutique hotels that are customized towards a particular customer profile. Generally, these hotels will be operated by an independent third party and either will have no brand affiliation, or will be associated with a major brand, while maintaining most of its independent identity (which we refer to as “soft-branded” hotels).\nRevenues earned at our hotels consist of three broad categories: rooms, food and beverage, and other revenues. While approximately 61% of our revenues in 2023 were generated from rooms sales, the majority of our properties feature a variety of amenities that help drive demand and profitability. Our hotels typically include meeting and banquet facilities, a variety of restaurants and lounges, swimming pools, exercise facilities and/or spas, gift shops and parking facilities, the combination of which enable them to serve business, leisure and group travelers.\n11\nOur consolidated portfolio includes 28 hotels that have more than 500 rooms. The average age of our properties is 36 years, although substantially all of them have benefited from significant renovations or major additions, as well as regularly scheduled renewal and replacement expenditures and other capital improvements. In our consolidated portfolio, approximately 88% of our hotels, by room count, are managed by their own brand managers, and 12% are managed by independent managers as a franchise or as an independent brand.\nBy Brand.\nThe following table details our consolidated hotel portfolio by brand as of February 23, 2024:\n___________\n(1)\nBased on our 2023 revenues; no individual hotel contributed more than 6% of total revenues in 2023. Hotels that are not considered upper upscale or luxury constitute approximately 1% of our revenues.\n12\nBy Location.\nThe following table details the locations and numbers of rooms at our consolidated hotels as of February 23, 2024:\n13\n___________\n(1)\nThe land on which this hotel is built is leased from a third party under one or more lease agreements.\n(2)\nThe land, building and improvements are leased from a third party under a long-term lease agreement.\n(3)\nThis property is not wholly owned.\nBy Market Location:\nWith our geographically diverse portfolio, no individual market represents more than 9% of total revenues. The following chart summarizes the composition of our consolidated hotels as of February 23, 2024 by each market location based on its percentage of 2023 revenues:\nOther Real Estate Interests\nWe own non-controlling interests in several entities that, as of February 23, 2024, owned, or owned an interest in,\n35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the ownership structure and economic or participating rights\n14\nof our partners, we do not consolidate the operations of the properties owned by these entities and they are included in equity in earnings in our consolidated results of operations. Our investments in these entities include the following:\nNoble Joint Venture.\nWhile our primary focus is the upper-upscale and luxury chain scales, we also seek opportunities to elevate our growth profile through investment in select service hotels, extended stay hotels and new development deals. Accordingly, in 2022, we entered into definitive agreements with Noble Investment Group, LLC, a leading private hospitality asset manager in the upscale, select service and extended stay chain scales, and certain other entities and persons related to Noble Investment Group, LLC, to acquire a minority equity interest in Noble Management Holdings, LLC and Noble Investment Holdings, LLC representing 49% of (a) the net fee income of the Noble Investment Group business in respect of existing and future Noble Investment Group funds and other revenue-based activities, (b) 40% of the gross carried interest earned on the funds formed after closing, and (c) proceeds earned by the general partner on  commitments to future funds. As part of our investment, we have made a $211.5 million capital commitment to Noble Hospitality Fund V, L.P. (\"Noble Fund V\"), which represents a 21.15% ownership interest in the fund. As of December 31, 2023, we have funded $33 million to Noble Fund V, which currently owns 25 select service and extended stay hotels and two land sites to be developed.\nUpon certain triggers being met, we have the ability to acquire up to 100% of Noble Management Holdings, LLC and Noble Investment Holdings, LLC. To the extent certain triggers are met and we have not exercised our call right, Noble Investment Group, LLC has a one-time ability, but not the obligation, to exercise its put right to cause us to purchase up to an additional 26% of Noble Management Holdings, LLC and Noble Investment Holdings, LLC.\nMaui Joint Venture.\nWe own a 67% interest in a joint venture with an affiliate of HV Global Group, a subsidiary of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, that owns a 131-unit vacation ownership development in Maui, Hawaii adjacent to our Hyatt Regency Maui Resort & Spa.\nHyatt Place Joint Venture\n. We own a 50% interest in a joint venture with White Lodging Services that owns the 255-room Hyatt Place Nashville Downtown in Tennessee. The joint venture has a $60 million mortgage loan that is non-recourse to us.\nHarbor Beach Joint Venture.\nWe own a 49.9% interest in a joint venture with R/V-C Association that owns the 650-room Fort Lauderdale Marriott Harbor Beach Resort & Spa in Florida. In December 2023, the joint venture completed the refinancing of the mortgage loan on the hotel with an initial draw of $152.5 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay the outstanding balance of $150 million. Additional advances of $32.5 million are available until December 31, 2025 to fund capital expenditures. The mortgage debt is non-recourse to us.\nAsia/Pacific Joint Venture.\nWe have a 25% interest in a joint venture with RECO Hotels JV Private Limited, an affiliate of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd. The agreement may be terminated by either partner at any time, which would trigger the liquidation of the joint venture. The commitment period for equity contributions to the joint venture has expired. Certain funding commitments remain, however, related to its existing investments in India.\nAs of December 31, 2023, this joint venture has invested approximately $109 million (of which our share is $27 million) in a separate joint venture in India with Accor S.A. and InterGlobe Enterprises Limited, in which it holds a 36% interest. This joint venture owns seven hotels and an office building in Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai, India, totaling approximately 1,718 rooms. The hotels are managed by AccorHotels under the Pullman, ibis and Novotel brands.\nFor additional information see\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4. Investments in Affiliates.”\nCompetition\nThe lodging industry is highly competitive. Competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on several factors, including location, brand, guest facilities and amenities, level of service, room rates and the quality of accommodations. The lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different categories, each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs: luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper midscale, midscale and economy. The classification of a hotel is based on lodging industry standards, which take into consideration many factors, such as guest facilities and amenities, level of service and quality of accommodations. Most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as 1 Hotels\n®\n, Alila\n®\n,\nAndaz\n®\n, Fairmont\n®\n, Four Seasons\n®\n,\nGrand Hyatt\n®\n, JW\n15\nMarriott\n®\n, Ritz-Carlton\n®\n, St. Regis\n®\n, The Don Cesar\n®\n, The Luxury Collection\n®\nand W\n®\n, or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as Autograph Collection\n®\n, Curio – A Collection by Hilton\n®\n, Embassy Suites by Hilton\n®\n, Hilton\n®\n, Hyatt Regency\n®\n, Marriott\n®\n, Marriott Marquis\n®\n, Sheraton\n®\n, Swissôtel\n®\n,\nTribute Portfolio\n®\nand Westin\n®\n.\n1\nWhile our hotels compete primarily with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale category, they also may compete with hotels in other lower-tier categories. A recent source of supply for the lodging industry has been the rapid growth of online short-term rentals, including as a flexible option for apartment buildings. Our hotels also may compete with these short-term rentals in certain markets. In addition, many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting, franchising or developing other hotels in our markets. As a result, our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own, invest in, manage or franchise.\nWe also compete with other REITs and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities as we attempt to position our portfolio to best take advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers.\nSeasonality\nOur hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality, which varies based on the individual hotel and the region. Hotel sales for our consolidated portfolio were approximately 26%, 26%, 23% and 25% for the first, second, third and fourth calendar quarters, respectively, in 2023.\nEnvironmental, Governmental and Regulatory Matters\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of hazardous or toxic materials, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the way property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures. In connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels, we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities. Although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us, we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future.\nOur hotels also are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons and we have in the past and may in the future incur capital expenditures to make our hotels accessible\n.\nThese and other building laws and regulations may be changed from time to time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. A determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance, the imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the Justice Department or an award of attorneys’ fees to private litigants. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of February 23, 2024, we had 163 employees, all of whom work in the United States, including our regional office in Miami. The current average tenure of our employees is more than 13 years, and the voluntary and total turnover rates in 2023 were 5% and 7%, respectively. Our human capital objectives include encouraging individual contributions, reinforcing Host’s EPIC values and culture, maximizing employee engagement and retention and minimizing organizational disruption through succession action plans. Our employees are given the opportunity to participate in training and education programs such as external training, professional certifications, executive and leadership coaching, continuing education and professional memberships. Additionally, all employees receive annual performance reviews that incorporate our EPIC values and our competencies, which include adaptability, communication, teamwork and complete thinking. We encourage regular and ongoing feedback tied to performance and career development. In order to ensure that\n1\nThis annual report contains registered trademarks that are the exclusive property of their respective owners, which are companies other than us. None of the owners of these trademarks, their affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, agents or employees, has or will have any responsibility or liability for any information contained in this annual report.\n16\nwe are meeting our human capital objectives, we conduct employee surveys to obtain feedback on various topics, informing how we execute on specific programs.\nOur CEO is a part of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative to continue to advance diversity and inclusion within our workplace, along with our formal diversity and inclusion initiative. We also provide unconscious bias training to our employees. As of December 31, 2023, our total workforce consists of 42% men and 58% women, with 46% of management positions held by women. Our workforce also consists of 39% minorities, with 23% of management positions held by minorities.\nThe number of employees referenced above does not include the hotel employees of our three hotels in Brazil, which, while technically Host employees, are under the direct supervision and control of our third-party hotel manager in Brazil. The employees at all of our U.S. and Canadian hotels are employees of our third-party hotel managers, who are responsible for hiring and maintaining employees.\nAlthough we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels, we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force. Employees of our third-party hotel managers at 17 of our hotels, representing approximately 26% of our total room count, are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis. For a discussion of these relationships, see\n“Risk Factors—We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.” None of Host’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nWhere to Find Additional Information\nThe address of our principal executive office is 4747 Bethesda Ave, Suite 1300, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814.

    "text": "For an enterprise as large and complex as we are, a wide range of factors could materially affect future results and performance. The statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nFinancial Risks and Risks of Operation\nOur revenues and the value of our hotels are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry.\nThe performance of the lodging industry traditionally has been affected by the strength of the general economy and, specifically, growth in gross domestic product. Because lodging industry demand typically follows the general economy, the lodging industry is highly cyclical, which contributes to potentially large fluctuations in our financial\n17\ncondition and our results of operations. Changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers, particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper upscale and generally target business and high-end leisure travelers. In periods of economic difficulties, certain business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce the cost of their trips. Consequently, our hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenues during an economic downturn, as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates. Other circumstances affecting the lodging industry which may affect our performance and the forecasts we make include:\n•\nthe effect on lodging demand of changes in national and local economic and business conditions, including concerns about U.S. economic growth and the potential for an economic recession in the United States or globally, the recent high level of inflation, rising interest rates, global economic prospects, consumer confidence and the value of the U.S. dollar;\n•\nfactors that may shape public perception of travel to a particular location, including natural disasters, such as the Maui wildfires in 2023, weather events, such as Hurricane Ian in 2022, pandemics and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the occurrence or potential occurrence of terrorist attacks, all of which will affect occupancy rates at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services;\n•\nrisks that U.S. immigration policies and border closings, travel restrictions or advisories, changes in energy prices or changes in foreign exchange rates will suppress international travel to the United States generally or decrease the labor pool;\n•\nthe impact of geopolitical developments outside the U.S., such as large-scale wars or international conflicts, slowing global growth, or trade tensions and tariffs between the United States and its trading partners such as China, all of which could affect global travel and lodging demand within the United States;\n•\nvolatility in global financial and credit markets, which could materially adversely affect U.S. and global economic conditions, business activity, and lodging demand as well as negatively impact our ability to obtain financing and increase our borrowing costs;\n•\nfuture U.S. governmental action to address budget deficits through reductions in spending and similar austerity measures, as well as the impact of potential U.S. government shutdowns, all of which could materially adversely affect U.S. economic conditions, business activity, credit availability and borrowing costs;\n•\noperating risks associated with the hotel business, including the effect of labor stoppages or strikes, increasing operating or labor costs, including increased labor costs in the current inflationary environment, the ability of our managers to adequately staff our hotels as a result of shortages in labor, severance and furlough payments to hotel employees or changes in workplace rules that affect labor costs;\n•\nthe ability of our hotels to compete effectively against other lodging businesses in the highly competitive markets in which we operate in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations and room rate structures;\n•\nchanges in the desirability of the geographic regions of the hotels in our portfolio or in the travel patterns of hotel customers;\n•\nchanges in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, hotel employee health care costs, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs; and\n•\ndecreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to in-person meetings, including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks.\nIn addition, the U.S. economy experienced high rates of inflation from 2021 to 2023, which has increased our operating expenses due to higher wages and costs, and rates of inflation may remain elevated in the future. Moreover, our interest expense has increased due to higher interest rates on our variable rate debt. Although the short-term nature of hotel bookings generally allows our managers to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing room rates at our hotels, sustained inflation could have a negative impact on the demand for lodging. Moreover, an inflationary environment can increase the costs of hotel renovations and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline, which can have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.\n18\nWe cannot assure you that adverse changes in the general economy or other circumstances that affect the lodging industry will not have an adverse effect on the hotel revenues or earnings at our hotels. Our efforts to mitigate the risks associated with these adverse changes may not be successful and our business and growth could be adversely affected. A reduction in our revenues or earnings because of the above risks may reduce our working capital, impact our long-term business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements. In addition, we may incur impairment expense in the future, which expense will affect negatively our results of operations. We can provide no assurance that any impairment expense recognized will not be material to our results of operations.\nIn addition to general economic conditions affecting the lodging industry, new hotel room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry’s performance and overbuilding has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic downturn. Room rates and occupancy, and thus RevPAR, tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth. A reduction or slowdown in the growth of lodging demand or increased growth in lodging supply could result in returns that are substantially below expectations or result in losses which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.\nWe depend on external sources of capital for future growth; therefore, any disruption to our ability to access capital at times, and on terms reasonably acceptable to us, may affect adversely our business and results of operations.\nSince we have elected REIT status, Host Inc. must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) each year to qualify as a REIT. Our ability to access external capital could be hampered by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n•\nprice volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the U.S. and global equity and credit markets;\n•\nchanges in market perception of our growth potential, including rating agency downgrades by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings; if our credit ratings were to be downgraded, our access to capital and the cost of debt financing could be further negatively impacted, particularly if we were downgraded to below an investment grade rating;\n•\ndecreases in our current or estimated future earnings or decreases or fluctuations in the market price of the common stock of Host Inc.;\n•\nincreases in interest rates; and\n•\nthe terms of our existing indebtedness, which would restrict our incurrence of additional debt if we were to fall below required covenant levels.\nThe occurrence of any of the above factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on (i) our ability to finance our future growth and acquire hotels, (ii) our ability to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures, and (iii) our results of operations and financial condition. Potential consequences of disruptions in U.S. and global equity and credit markets could include the need to seek alternative sources of capital with less attractive terms, such as more restrictive covenants, shorter maturity and higher costs which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe lodging industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors are other owners and investors in upper upscale and luxury full-service hotels, including other lodging REITs. Our hotels face strong competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business from major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands, as well as from other smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners and operators. Our hotels compete for customers primarily based on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, room rates, property size and availability of rooms and conference space, quality of the accommodations, customer satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. New hotel construction adds to supply, creating new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. Our competitors may have similar or greater commercial and financial resources which allow them to improve their hotels in ways that affect our ability to compete for guests effectively and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth. We also compete for hotel acquisitions with others that have similar investment objectives to ours. This competition could limit the number of investment opportunities that we find suitable for our business. It also may increase the bargaining power of hotel\n19\nowners seeking to sell to us, making it more difficult for us to acquire new hotels on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in our business plan.\nThe growth of internet reservation channels also is a source of competition that could adversely affect our business. A significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual or “transient” customers are booked through internet travel intermediaries. Search engines and peer-to-peer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our hotels. If bookings shift to higher cost distribution channels, including these internet travel intermediaries, it could materially impact our revenues and profitability. Additionally, as intermediary bookings increase, they may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from the brands and hotel management companies managing and operating our hotels. Internet travel intermediaries may also target group and convention business, which could divert such business and materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThere are inherent risks with investments in real estate, including their relative illiquidity.\nInvestments in real estate are inherently illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. For this reason, we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel that we desire to sell for the price or on terms acceptable to us, or the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close on the sale of a hotel. Therefore, we may not be able to vary the composition of our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions or dispose of hotels at opportune times or on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. In addition, real estate ownership is subject to various risks, including:\n•\ngovernment regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations, including tax, environmental, zoning and eminent domain laws;\n•\nloss in value of real estate due to changes in market conditions or the area in which it is located or losses in value due to changes in tax laws or increased property tax assessments;\n•\npotential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties;\n•\nthe ongoing need for owner-funded capital improvements and expenditures in order to maintain or upgrade hotels;\n•\nperiodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements; and\n•\nforce majeure events, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or other possibly uninsured losses.\nWe have significant indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately $4.2 billion. Our indebtedness requires us to commit a significant portion of our annual cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs. Additionally, our substantial indebtedness could:\n•\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n•\nlimit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all; or\n•\naffect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.\nIf our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness, we will be required to raise additional funds through sales of common or preferred OP units of Host L.P. or common or preferred stock of Host Inc., the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by Host L.P. or sales of our assets. We cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan.\n20\nThe terms of our indebtedness place restrictions on us and on our subsidiaries, and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks.\nWe are, and may in the future become, party to agreements and instruments that place restrictions on us and on our subsidiaries. For instance, the covenants in the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n•\nincur additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics; and\n•\npay dividends on classes and series of Host Inc. capital stock and pay distributions on Host L.P.’s classes of units or make stock repurchases without satisfying certain financial metrics concerning leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage.\nThe restrictive covenants in our senior notes and credit facility may reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our indebtedness. For a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness, see Part II Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition.”\nOur expenses may not decrease if our revenues decrease.\nMany of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt-service payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible. They do not necessarily decrease directly with a reduction in revenues at the hotels and may be subject to increases that are not tied to the performance of our hotels or the increase in the rate of inflation generally. Additionally, certain costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. In the event of a significant decrease in demand, our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits. Our managers also may be unable to offset any fixed or increased expenses with higher room rates. Any of our efforts to reduce operating costs also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotels.\nOur acquisition of hotels may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.\nWe routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible transactions for acquiring hotels. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions. Our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations. These adverse effects may occur because the performance of the hotel does not support the additional indebtedness and related interest expense that we incurred as a result of the acquisition. In addition, hotels and entities that we have acquired, or may in the future acquire, may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the sellers. In general, the representations and warranties provided in the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and to seek recourse against our sellers, and indemnification covering representations and warranties often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties.\nWe may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels.\nWe currently are, and in the future may be, involved in the development or redevelopment of hotels, timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing hotels, including the development of retail, office or apartments, and including through joint ventures. There are risks inherent in any new development, including:\n•\nWe may not obtain the zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development. A delay in receiving these approvals could affect adversely the returns we expect to receive.\n21\n•\nAny new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costs, including increased costs due to shortages of supplies as a result of supply chain disruptions.\n•\nDefects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a hotel to be closed during the period required to remedy the defect.\n•\nWe may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any indebtedness obtained to fund the new development, creating default risks.\n•\nRisks related to change in economic and market conditions between development commencement and property stabilization.\nAny of the above factors could affect adversely our ability to complete the developments on schedule and consistent with the scope that currently is contemplated, or to achieve the intended value of these projects.\nWe do not control our hotel operations, and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.\nTo maintain our status as a REIT, we are not permitted to operate or manage any of our hotels. As a result, we, through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotels. For this reason, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters. Although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans, the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters. While we monitor the hotel managers’ performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. The cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name. Because our management agreements are long-term in nature, we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately.\nFrom time to time, we have had, and continue to have, disputes with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. If we are unable to reach a satisfactory resolution to these disputes through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution. Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations could affect adversely our results of operations.\nIn addition, our hotel managers or their affiliates manage, and in some cases own, have invested in, or provided credit support or operating guarantees, to hotels that compete with our hotels, all of which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, our hotel managers have in the past made, and may in the future make, decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest. Furthermore, our management agreements for our brand managed properties generally have provisions that can restrict our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels, unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets other specified conditions. Our ability to finance or sell our hotels, depending upon the structure of the transactions, may require the manager’s consent. Similarly, decisions with respect to the repositioning of a hotel, such as the outsourcing of food and beverage outlets, also may require the manager’s consent.\nThe hotels managed by Marriott International account for most of our revenues and operating income. Adverse developments in Marriott’s business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us.\nApproximately 62% of our hotels (as measured by 2023 revenues) are managed or franchised by Marriott International. We rely on Marriott’s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage and maintain our hotel operations efficiently, effectively, profitably and in compliance with the terms, responsibilities and duties of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in Marriott’s business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our hotels and could have a material adverse effect on us.\n22\nWe are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.\nOur third-party managers are responsible for hiring, maintaining and managing the labor force at each of our hotels. We do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels (other than employing, but not managing, directing or supervising, the employees at our three hotels in Brazil). However, we remain subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly at those hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted because of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. In 2024, collective bargaining agreements will expire at hotels in Seattle, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Those negotiations potentially could result in disruptions in operations and additional costs. We also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs because of disputes involving our third-party managers and their labor force. The resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, which is a significant component of our hotel operating costs, either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. As we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement, we do not negotiate with any labor organization, and it is the responsibility of each hotel’s manager to enter into such labor contracts. Our ability, if any, to have any meaningful impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the management agreement covering a specific hotel and we may have little or no ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.\nOur hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace, to maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations. The timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments.\nWe need to make capital expenditures to remain competitive with other hotels, to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We also are required by our hotel management agreements to make agreed upon capital expenditures to our hotels. The timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance, particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels, such as ballrooms, meeting space and restaurants. These capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays. In addition, because we depend on external sources of capital, we may not have the necessary funds to invest and, if we fail to maintain our hotels in accordance with brand standards set by our managers, they may terminate the management agreement. Moreover, we may not necessarily realize a significant, or any, improvement in the performance of the hotels at which we make these investments.\nA large proportion of our hotels are located in a limited number of large urban cities and, accordingly, we could be disproportionately harmed by adverse changes to these markets or events impacting these markets.\nHotels in the following cities and states represented approximately 69% of our 2023 revenues: New York, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco, Florida, Hawaii, Los Angeles and Phoenix. An economic downturn, an increase in hotel supply in these cities and markets, natural disasters, weather events, terrorist attacks, health epidemics, or similar events in any one of these cities and markets likely would cause a decline in hotel demand and adversely affect occupancy rates, the financial performance of our hotels in these cities and markets and our overall results of operations. For example, lodging demand in Maui, one of our largest markets by revenues, was significantly impacted by wildfires in 2023, and the effect on lodging demand is expected to continue in 2024. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, large urban markets with enhanced restrictions on social gatherings, such as New York and San Francisco where we have a significant number of hotel rooms, were disproportionately impacted by the decline in lodging demand. Additionally, in September 2017, our operations in Florida and Houston were impacted negatively by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey and in 2022, a majority of our hotels in Florida were affected by Hurricane Ian. The threat of terrorism also may negatively impact hotel occupancy and average daily rate, due to resulting disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety. Hotels in major metropolitan areas, such as the major cities that represent our largest markets, may be particularly adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety.\nWe may acquire or develop hotels in joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.\nWe have made investments in joint ventures, such as our 2022 joint venture with Noble Investment Group, LLC, and are exploring further investment or development opportunities. We may, from time to time, invest as a co-venturer in other entities owning hotels instead of purchasing them directly. We also may sell interests in existing hotels or existing entities to a third party as part of forming a joint venture with the third party. Investments in joint ventures may involve\n23\nrisks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Co-venturers may control or share control over the operations of a joint venture. Actions by a co-venturer also could subject the hotels to additional risks because our co-venturer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals. Disputes between us and our partners or co-venturers may result in litigation that would increase our expenses and may negatively impact hotel operations.\nSome potential losses are not covered by insurance.\nWe carry comprehensive insurance coverage for property, business interruption, terrorism, and other risks with respect to all our hotels and other properties. We also carry, or in certain instances cause our hotel managers to carry, general liability insurance with respect to all our hotels and other properties. Certain coverages related to hotel managers’ employer status, such as worker's compensation, are insured under the hotel manager’s policies. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties. Generally, our “all-risk” property policies provide coverage that is available on a per-occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, has an overall limit, as well as various sub-limits, on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. Sub-limits exist for certain types of claims, such as service interruption, debris removal, expediting costs, landscaping replacement, and certain natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits. The dollar amounts of these sub-limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit. In this regard, hotels in certain of our markets, including California, Florida, Hawaii, Houston, New Orleans and Seattle, have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters and the applicable sub-limits are significantly lower than the total value of the hotels we own in states where natural disasters are possible. Recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles, either fixed or as a percentage of total insured value, self-insurance retentions, or insurance issued by a \"captive insurer\" affiliated with Host Inc. There is no assurance that this insurance, where maintained, will fully fund the re-building or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or a terrorism event, or will fully fund the income lost as a result of the damage. Our property insurance policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable occurrence must be combined for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub-limits provided in our policies have been exceeded. Therefore, if an insurable occurrence affects more than one of our hotels, the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. Each affected hotel may only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available. For example, if a hurricane were to cause widespread damage to Florida, claims from each of our hotels would be aggregated against the policy limit or sub-limit and could exceed the applicable limit or sub-limit. We may incur losses in excess of insured limits, and we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism. We are still evaluating the business interruption impact, including related insurance coverage, to our Florida hotels caused by Hurricane Ian in September 2022, as well as to our Maui hotels caused by the August 2023 wildfires, as further discussed in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17. Legal Proceedings, Guarantees and Contingencies.”\nIn addition, there are other risks relating to property insurance, such as certain environmental hazards, that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage. Also, insurance coverage for war, infectious disease, and nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological perils is extremely limited. We also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy, which may require litigation. Should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur, or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a hotel, as well as its anticipated future revenues.\nCyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers’ or our own information technology systems, or the information technology systems of third parties on which we or our managers rely, could materially adversely affect our business and results.\nOur third-party hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to access, process, transmit and store proprietary and customer information. These complex networks include reservation systems, vacation exchange systems, hotel management systems, customer databases, call centers, administrative systems, and third-party vendor systems. These systems require the collection and retention of large volumes of personally identifiable information of hotel guests, including credit card numbers and passport numbers. Our hotel managers may store and process such customer information as well as proprietary information both on systems\n24\nlocated at the hotels that we own and other hotels that they operate and manage, their corporate locations and at third-party owned facilities, including, for example, in a third-party hosted cloud environment. These information networks and systems are vulnerable to numerous and evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems and information such as system, network or internet failures; computer hacking or operational disruption (e.g., due to ransomware); cyber-terrorism; viruses, worms or other malicious software programs; social engineering (e.g., phishing); employee error, negligence, malfeasance or fraud; and misconfigurations, \"bugs\" or other vulnerabilities in software and hardware.\nThese threats can be introduced in any number of ways, including through third parties accessing our hotel managers’ information networks and systems or by exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party software, technologies, tools, services or systems. The risks from these cyber threats are significant. Marriott International, the manager of a majority of our hotels, experienced a material data security breach involving the unauthorized access to the Starwood guest reservation database between 2014 and 2018. The UK Information Commissioner's Office has fined Marriott £18.4 million, and Marriott remains subject to other lawsuits and investigations arising around the world. Marriott has also experienced other, lesser data breaches since 2018 as well. No assurances can be made as to the outcome of these data breach lawsuits or investigations.\nWe rely on the security systems of our managers to maintain hotel operations and to protect proprietary and hotel customer information. Any compromise of our managers’ or their critical third-party networks could result in a disruption to our managers’ operations, such as the disruption in fulfilling guest reservations, delayed bookings or sales, lost guest reservations, or compromises to information. Any of these events could, in turn, result in disruption of the operations of the hotels that we own that are managed by them, increased costs (e.g., to comply with regulatory requirements or to remediate systems), potential litigation (including class actions), and regulatory enforcement and liability. All our major hotel management companies and a majority of our third-party operators maintain insurance against cyber threats. However, these policies provide varying limits and may be subject to sub-limits for certain types of claims, and it is not expected that these policies will provide a total recovery of all potential losses. In addition, public disclosure, or loss of customer or proprietary information, such as disclosed by Marriott in November 2018, may result in damage to the manager’s reputation and a loss of confidence among hotel guests and result in reputational harm for the hotels owned by us and managed by them, which may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the information technologies and systems of our managers used to operate our hotels, we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access, store, transmit, and manage or support a variety of our business processes and proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the security measures we, our managers or third-party providers have taken to protect systems and information will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in detecting or preventing failures, inadequacies or interruptions in system services or that system security will not be breached through physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, and attacks by hackers or insiders. This is particularly so because cyberattack methodologies change frequently or are often not recognized until launched. We, our managers and third-party providers may be unable to identify, investigate or remediate cyber events or incidents because attackers are increasingly using sophisticated techniques and tools (including artificial intelligence and machine learning) that can avoid detection, circumvent security controls, and even remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. Further, any adoption of artificial intelligence by us or by third parties may pose new security challenges.\nDisruptions in service, system shutdowns and security breaches in the information technologies and systems we, our managers or third-party providers maintain, including unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information, could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial reporting, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, which amounts could be significant as the White House, SEC, and other regulators have increased their focus on companies' cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and increase the costs of compliance and remediation. We currently maintain cyber insurance, which includes coverage for third-party liability (damages and settlements to third parties) and first-party loss (costs incurred by us in response to a network security or privacy event). However, as with our operator’s coverage, our policy is subject to limits and sub-limits for certain types of claims and we do not expect that this policy will cover all the losses that we could experience from these exposures.\nIn addition, data privacy and cybersecurity rules, regulations and industry standards are rapidly evolving. Evolving U.S. privacy and security laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and similar laws being enacted or already in force in other states, are imposing significant requirements on companies and, in the California Consumer Privacy Act's case, providing a private right of action with statutory damages available to plaintiffs for certain types of data breaches. Failure to comply with current and future laws, industry standards and other legal obligations or any security\n25\nincident resulting in operational disruptions and/or the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties and adverse publicity and could cause a material adverse effect on both the managers of our hotels and our business and results of operations. We and our managers also may be required to invest significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements, to enhance our information security controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nApplicable REIT laws may restrict certain business activities.\nAs a REIT, each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT is subject to various restrictions on the types of revenues it can earn, assets it can own and activities in which it can engage. Business activities that could be restricted by applicable REIT laws include, but are not limited to, developing alternative uses of real estate and the ownership of hotels that are not leased to a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), including the development and/or sale of timeshare or condominium units or the related land parcels. Due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will continue to conduct certain business activities, including, but not limited to, those mentioned above, in one or more of our TRS. Our TRS are taxable as C corporations and are subject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable, foreign taxation on their taxable income.\nWe face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, including  more frequent or severe storms, droughts, hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, wildfires, power shortages or outages and extreme temperatures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations and business including, but not limited to, by damaging properties, by increasing the costs associated with our properties, or by decreasing the attractiveness of certain locations. For example, lodging demand in Maui, one of our largest markets by revenues, was significantly impacted by wildfires in 2023, and a majority of our hotels in Florida were affected by Hurricane Ian, which made landfall on September 28, 2022, with the most significant damage occurring at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa. While the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa re-opened to hotel guests in November 2022, as part of a phased reopening, the Ritz Carlton, Naples remained closed until July 2023. That hotel sustained significant damage due to storm surge, which breached the beach dune and flooded the lowest level of the hotel. Over time, our coastal markets also are expected to continue to experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels causing damage to our hotels. As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. Other markets such as Arizona may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access to the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs, which may subject those hotels to additional regulatory burdens, such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards. Climate change also may affect our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs at our hotels, such as the cost of water or energy, and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our hotels against such risks. In addition, changes in government legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our properties. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations or business.\nRisks of Ownership of Host Inc.’s Common Stock\nThere are limitations on the acquisition of Host Inc. common stock and changes in control.\nHost Inc.’s charter and bylaws, the partnership agreement of Host L.P., and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) contain a number of provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for Host Inc.’s stockholders or Host L.P.’s unitholders, including the following:\n•\nRestrictions on transfer and ownership of Host Inc.’s stock\n. To assist in maintaining Host Inc.’s qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, Host Inc.’s charter prohibits ownership, directly or by attribution, by any person or persons acting as a group, of more than 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of Host Inc.’s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other class or series of stock, each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose. Together, these limitations are referred to as the “ownership limit.” Stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the intended acquirer of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to vote those shares of stock or to receive the economic benefits of owning shares of Host Inc.’s stock in\n26\nexcess of the ownership limit. A transfer of shares of Host Inc.’s stock to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the ownership limit also may be void under certain circumstances.\n•\nRemoval of members of the Board of Directors.\nHost Inc.’s charter provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of capital stock other than common stock, directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast for the election of directors. Any vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders may be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast for the election of directors.\n•\nPreferred shares; classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval\n. Host Inc.’s Board of Directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock, and to establish the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. Host Inc.’s Board of Directors may give the holders of any class or series of stock terms, preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock.\n•\nCertain provisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of Host Inc. Certain provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from acquiring Host Inc., including:\n◦\n“business combination” provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between a corporation and an “interested stockholder” (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation’s then outstanding shares of voting stock) or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes two super-majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and\n◦\n“control share” provisions providing that holders of “control shares” of a corporation (defined as voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nHost Inc. is subject to the Maryland business combination statute. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the MGCL. There can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.\n•\nCertain charter amendments.\nHost Inc.’s charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of Host Inc.’s stock, fixing the size of the Board of Directors within the range set forth in the charter, removal of directors, the filling of vacancies, exculpation and indemnification of directors, calling special stockholder meetings and certain other provisions, all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by Host Inc.’s stockholders holding two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. These provisions may make it more difficult to amend Host Inc.’s charter to alter the provisions described herein that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of Host Inc. common stock, without the approval of the Board of Directors.\nFederal Income Tax Risks\nAdverse tax consequences would occur if Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT.\nWe believe that each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT has been organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT under the Code, commencing with its taxable year beginning January 1, 1999, and April 11, 2006, respectively, and both currently intend to continue to operate and qualify as a REIT during future years. As the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a REIT are limited, no assurance can be provided that Host Inc. currently qualifies as a REIT or will continue to qualify as a REIT or that Host Inc.’s subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT or will\n27\ncontinue to qualify as a REIT. If our subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that Host Inc. would fail to qualify as a REIT unless it (or the subsidiary REIT) could avail itself of certain relief provisions. If Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions do not apply, the non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income. Any such corporate income tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the non-qualifying REIT’s cash available for, among other things, operations and dividends to its stockholders. In addition, if Host Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it would not be required to pay dividends to its stockholders. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT could not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.\nTo qualify as a REIT, each of Host Inc. and our subsidiary REIT is required to satisfy the requirements of several asset and gross income tests. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which assets are not susceptible to a precise determination of fair market value, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT asset and gross income tests requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our gross income and assets on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not contend that our hotel leases, interests in subsidiaries, or interests in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT gross income and asset tests requirements.\nAny determination that Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT does not qualify as a REIT will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of Host Inc.’s common stock. The additional corporate income tax liability of Host Inc. or the subsidiary REIT for the year, or years, in which it does not qualify as a REIT would reduce its cash flow available for investment, debt service or dividends to its stockholders. Furthermore, the entity not qualifying as a REIT no longer would be required to pay dividends to its stockholders as a condition to REIT qualification, and any dividends paid to stockholders would be taxable as C corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that, if Host Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT, Host Inc.’s stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on dividends at capital gain tax rates and Host Inc.’s corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case to applicable limitations under the Code. Host Inc.’s failure to qualify as a REIT also would cause an event of default under Host L.P.’s credit facility, which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under Host L.P.’s outstanding debt securities.\nIf our hotel managers do not qualify as “eligible independent contractors,” or if our hotels are not “qualified lodging facilities,” each of Host Inc. and our subsidiary REIT will fail to qualify as a REIT.\nEach hotel with respect to which our TRS pays rent must be a “qualified lodging facility.” A “qualified lodging facility” is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who legally is authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. We believe that all the hotels leased to our TRS are qualified lodging facilities. However, the REIT provisions of the Code provide only limited guidance for making determinations of whether a leased hotel is considered a qualified lodging facility, and there can be no assurance that our leased hotels will be so considered in all cases.\nIf our hotel managers do not qualify as “eligible independent contractors,” Host Inc. and our subsidiary REIT likely will fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Each of the hotel management companies that enters into a management contract with our TRS must qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” under the REIT rules in order for the rent paid to Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT by our TRS to be qualifying gross income for the REIT gross income tests requirements. Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, a hotel manager cannot own more than 35% of our outstanding shares (by value) and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the hotel manager, taking into account only owners of more than 5% of our shares and, with respect to ownership interests in such hotel managers that are publicly traded, only owners of more than 5% of such ownership interests. Complex ownership attribution rules apply for purposes of these 35% ownership thresholds. Although we monitor ownership of our shares by our hotel managers and their owners, and certain provisions of our charter are designed to prevent ownership of our shares in violation of these rules, there can be no assurance that these ownership limits will not be exceeded.\n28\nThe size of our TRS is limited and our transactions with our TRS will cause us to be subject to a 100% excise tax on certain income or deductions if such transactions are not conducted on arm’s-length terms.\nA REIT may own up to 100% of the equity interests of an entity that is a regular C corporation for federal income tax purposes if the entity is a TRS. A TRS may own assets and earn gross income that would not be considered as qualifying assets or as qualifying gross income if owned or earned directly by a REIT, including revenues from hotel operations. Both the REIT and its C corporation subsidiary must jointly elect to treat such C corporation subsidiary as a TRS. A C corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of its stock or securities automatically will be treated as a TRS. No more than 20% of the total value of a REIT’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRS.\nOur TRS will pay federal corporate income tax and applicable state and local corporate income tax and, if applicable, foreign corporate income tax on its taxable income. The after-tax net income of our TRS will be available for distribution to us as a taxable dividend to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits, but it is not required to be so distributed. We believe that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our TRS has been and will continue to be less than 20% of the total value of our assets (including our TRS stock and securities). Furthermore, we monitor the value of our investments in our TRS for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this 20% requirement. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 20% value limitation discussed above.\nRent paid to Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT by our TRS cannot be based on its net income or profits for such rents to qualify as “rents from real property.” We receive “percentage rent” from our TRS that is calculated based on the gross revenues of the hotels subject to leases - not based on net income or profits of such hotels. If the IRS determines that the rent paid pursuant to our leases with our TRS are excessive, the deductibility thereof by the TRS may be challenged, and we could be subject to a 100% excise tax on “re-determined rent” or “re-determined deductions” to the extent that such rent exceeds an arm’s-length amount. We believe that our rent and other transactions between our REITs and their TRS are based on arm’s-length amounts and reflect normal business practices, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our belief.\nDespite the REIT status of each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT, we remain subject to various taxes.\nNotwithstanding Host Inc.’s status as a REIT, Host Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (including our subsidiary REIT) are subject to federal, state, local and foreign corporate taxes on their net income, gross receipts, net worth, and property, in certain cases. Host L.P. is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host Inc.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.\nNew legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entity’s qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of its REIT qualification. If Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions do not apply, the non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income at C corporation income tax rates. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT could not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.\nRisks Relating to Redemption of OP Units\nA holder who offers its OP units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences.\nA limited partner who elects to redeem its OP units will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the OP units, resulting in a taxable event to such limited partner. The gain or loss recognized by the limited partner is measured by the difference between the amount realized and the tax basis of the OP units redeemed (which tax basis includes the amount of the qualified nonrecourse liabilities of Host L.P. allocated to the redeemed OP units). It is possible that the amount of gain and/or the tax liability related thereto that the limited partner recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash received from the redemption of its OP units.\n29\nGeneral Risk Factors\nShares of Host Inc.’s common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of Host Inc.’s common stock.\nWe have in the past issued and may in the future issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, refinance debt or for other corporate purposes. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Host Inc.’s common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could affect adversely prevailing market prices for Host Inc.’s common stock. In addition, limited partners of Host L.P. who redeem their OP units and receive, at Host Inc.’s election, shares of Host Inc. common stock will be able to sell those shares freely. As of December 31, 2023, there are approximately 9.5 million Host L.P. OP units outstanding that are owned by third parties and that are redeemable, which represents approximately 1% of all outstanding OP units. Further, shares of Host Inc.’s common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans. We currently maintain two stock-based compensation plans: (i) the comprehensive stock and cash incentive plan, and (ii) an employee stock purchase plan. At December 31, 2023, there were approximately three million shares of Host Inc.’s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan and employee stock purchase plan.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate indebtedness and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or to sell assets.\nInterest payments for borrowings on our credit facility and the mortgages on certain properties are based on floating rates. As a result, an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes, including investments in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 24% of our debt is subject to floating interest rates. Rising interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness when it matures and increase interest costs on any indebtedness that is refinanced. We may from time to time enter into agreements such as floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other hedging contracts in order to fully or partially hedge against the cash flow effects of changes in interest rates for floating rate debt. These agreements expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our hotels, thereby limiting our ability to dispose of them as part of our business strategy.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other government regulations can be costly.\nOur hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons and we incur capital expenditures to make our hotels accessible. In addition, we have committed to provide, and certain local laws and contracts between our hotel managers and hotel workers’ unions require our hotels to provide, our managers’ employees with safety devices, sometimes known as “panic buttons.” We fund the capital necessary to ensure that employees at our hotels will be equipped with these safety devices. These and other laws and regulations may be changed from time-to-time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. A determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance, imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the Justice Department, or an award of attorneys’ fees to private litigants. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. Any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the operations of our foreign hotels are subject to a variety of United States and international laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, but we cannot assure that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations.\nLitigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business and are defending these claims vigorously; however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We believe, based on currently available information, that the results of current proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any period, depending, in part, upon the quantum of our operating results for such period. We also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels, individuals or companies who use our hotels, our investors, our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n30\nEnvironmental liabilities are possible and can be costly.\nOur hotels are subject to requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. Unidentified environmental liabilities could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Additionally, even after we have sold a hotel, we may be liable for environmental liabilities attributable to events that occurred during our ownership. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. The owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials.\nAn increased focus on metrics and reporting related to corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") factors, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nESG evaluations, including ESG scores and ratings, are important to some investors and other stakeholders and may impact the price of our securities and business practices. Investors may focus on, and consider a company's ESG-related business practices, scores and reporting when choosing to allocate their capital in making investment decisions, including if they invest in our securities. Further, the criteria used in these ratings systems change frequently, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to score well as criteria change. Failure to participate in certain of the third-party ratings systems, failure to score well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain ESG disclosures could result in reputational harm when investors or others compare us against similar companies in our industry and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our stock which could adversely impact our ability to raise capital.\nIn addition, the adoption of increased government regulations and changes in investor preference related to ESG and similar matters may result in changes to our business practices, including increasing expenses or capital expenditures. Other impacts related to ESG matters may include the costs of compliance with new or existing regulations, standards or reporting requirements regarding the environmental impacts of our business, such as the SEC's proposed climate change disclosure rule."

    "text": "Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our critical systems and information. We design and assess our program using components of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (\"NIST CSF\"). This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, but rather that we use the NIST CSF as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas. Our cybersecurity risk management program is led by our senior vice president of information technology who has over 20 years of experience in information technology development and capabilities. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes the following\n31\nkey components, which allows the management team to stay informed about and monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of key cybersecurity risks and incidents:\n•\nimplementing technologies to proactively monitor vulnerabilities and reduce risk, maintaining security policies and standards, and regularly updating our response planning and protocols;\n•\nmaintaining business continuity, contingency and recovery plans, including a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents;\n•\nretaining a third-party cybersecurity provider for emergency incident response services;\n•\nannual assessments of our cybersecurity risk management program by a third-party security firm, as well as semi-annual vulnerability assessments and penetration testing by external service providers;\n•\ncybersecurity awareness training for employees as well as senior management, including quarterly refresher training; and\n•\nannual cybersecurity assessments of certain third-party service providers with access to our employee data.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program and processes, as described in this section, do not encompass the information technology systems of our third-party managers. As a REIT, we are required to retain third-party managers to run all operational aspects of our hotels, and our hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems that they procure and manage directly or through their own third-party service providers, to access, process, transmit and store proprietary and hotel customer information. We do not have access to these systems or to hotel customer information, and we rely on the security programs, processes and systems of our managers to protect hotel operations and customer information from cybersecurity threats.\nAs of February 23, 2024, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. While we have not been materially affected by known cybersecurity threats affecting the Company, we and our hotel managers continue to face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, could materially adversely affect us in the future. For more information on the risks related to cybersecurity threats, including threats faced by our hotel managers, see\n\"Risk Factors  —\nCyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers’ or our own information technology systems, or the information technology systems of third parties on which we or our managers rely, could materially adversely affect our business and results\n.”\nGovernance\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Audit Committee oversees management's implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program. The Audit Committee receives semi-annual updates on topics related to information security and cyber risks and readiness from our management team, including our senior vice president of information technology. Management updates the Audit Committee, as necessary, regarding any significant cybersecurity incidents. The Audit Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including information security and cybersecurity risks, which are presented to the full Board at least annually as part of the Board's oversight of enterprise risk management."

    "text": "The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion focuses on our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2023.\nOverview\nHost Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT that owns hotels and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common OP units as of December 31, 2023. The remainder of Host L.P.’s common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.’s day-to-day management and control.\nHost Inc. is the largest lodging REIT in NAREIT’s composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 23, 2024, we own 77 hotels in the United States, Canada and Brazil and have minority ownership interests in an additional 35 hotels through joint ventures in the United States and in India. These hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Most of our hotels are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations.\nOur customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, of our 2023 room sales. For a discussion of our customer categories, see “Item 1 Business – Our Customers”.\nUnderstanding Our Performance\nOur Revenues and Expenses.\nOur hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).\nOperations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 98% of our total revenues and 2% relate to our five hotels in Canada and Brazil. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenues as a percentage of our total revenue:\n37\nHotel operating expenses represent approximately 99% of our total operating costs and expenses. The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:\nThe expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. It also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. Taken separately, these costs represent approximately 57% of our rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses.\nKey Performance Indicators.\nThe following key performance indicators commonly are used in the hospitality industry and we believe provide useful information to management and investors in order to compare our performance with the performance of other lodging REITS:\n•\nhotel occupancy\nis a volume indicator based on the percentage of available room nights that are sold;\n•\naverage daily rate\n(“ADR”)\nis a price indicator calculated by dividing rooms revenues by the number of rooms sold;\n•\nrevenues per available room (“RevPAR”)\nis used to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and beverage, parking, or other guest service revenues generated by the hotel. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is considered a key indicator of core revenues for many hotels; and\n•\ntotal revenues per available room (“Total RevPAR”)\nis a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other ancillary services revenues by room nights available to guests for the period. It includes ancillary revenues that are not included in the calculation of RevPAR.\n38\nRevPAR changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenues, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, except those charged as a percentage of revenues. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.\nWe also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Our non-GAAP financial measures include:\n•\nNAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted FFO per diluted share.\nWe use NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share as supplemental measures of company-wide profitability. NAREIT adopted FFO to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust NAREIT FFO for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business.\n•\nComparable hotel EBITDA.\nHotel EBITDA measures property-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate-level expenses (as this is a property level measure) and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability. We use comparable hotel EBITDA and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels.\n•\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre.\nEarnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. NAREIT adopted EBITDA for real estate (“EBITDA\nre”\n) in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust EBITDA\nre\nfor property insurance gains, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business (“Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n”).\nSummary of 2023 Operating Results\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations and the significant operating statistics for the two years ended December 31, 2023 (in millions, except per share and hotel statistics):\n39\n___________\n(1)\nEBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share and comparable hotel operating results (including hotel revenues and hotel EBITDA and margins) are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” for more information on these measures, including why we believe these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally, comparable hotel results and statistics are based on 75 comparable hotels as of December 31, 2023 and include adjustments for non-comparable hotels, dispositions and acquisitions. See \"Comparable Hotel RevPAR Overview\" for results of the portfolio based on our ownership period, without these adjustments.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased $404 million, or 8.2%, compared to 2022, due to increased demand at our convention and downtown properties, partially offset by some moderation at our resort properties. Comparable hotel RevPAR increased 8.1%, compared to 2022, due to a 4.1 percentage point increase in occupancy and a 1.8% increase in average room rate. Comparable hotel Total RevPAR increased 8.3% for the year as the increase in rooms revenues was supplemented with growth in both food and beverage revenues and other revenues (see “Statement of Operations Results and Trends”).\nThe improvement during 2023 was buoyed by first quarter 2023 results, as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 significantly impaired travel during January and the first part of February in 2022. In addition, the recovery at our city-center properties throughout the year allowed for significant improvements in several markets, such as New York, Washington, D.C. and Boston. However, growth was muted during the year due to negative impacts from the August wildfires in Maui, moderating rates at resorts in comparison to 2022, as well as elevated levels of international outbound travel throughout the year while international inbound travel recovered at a slower pace. None of our hotels in Maui sustained physical damage from the August wildfires, and our hotels were still able to fill rooms with emergency response teams and displaced residents; however, we estimate that the wildfires negatively impacted our comparable hotel RevPAR and Total RevPAR by approximately 50 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, for the full year.\nComparable hotel Total RevPAR growth was led by our Boston, Washington, D.C., New York, and Houston markets with growth of 42.5%, 21.5%, 19.2%, and 19.2%, respectively, compared to 2022, through a combination of rate and occupancy growth, driven by strong group. Our hotels in Northern Virginia, Seattle, and San Francisco/San Jose also outperformed our portfolio with comparable hotel Total RevPAR increases of 18.4%, 15.9%, and 15.4%, respectively. These strong performances were offset by comparable hotel Total RevPAR declines at our Austin and Miami markets of 4.0% and 1.8%, respectively. The declines in Austin were driven primarily by decreases in rates due to weaker transient demand, while Miami was impacted by the ongoing renovation at the 1 Hotel South Beach. Comparable hotel Total RevPAR at our Maui/Oahu market decreased 5.1% due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires in August.\nOperating Profit\nAs expected, margins during the year faced downward pressure in comparison to 2022 following the ramp up in operations that year as our managers returned to stable staffing levels at our properties, while occupancy remained 8 percentage points below 2019 levels. In addition, we faced increased insurance and utility expenses, higher wages and a decline in attrition and cancelation revenues compared to 2022. These downward pressures on margins were partially offset by margin improvements achieved through the implementation of portfolio-wide cost reductions with our hotel managers over the past several years. As a result, operating profit margins (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) decreased 20 basis points to 15.6% in 2023, compared to 15.8% in 2022. Operating profit margins under GAAP are also significantly affected by several items, including acquisitions, dispositions, depreciation expense and corporate expenses, and in 2023 also benefited from business interruption gains of $83 million. Our\n40\ncomparable hotel EBITDA margins, which exclude these items and benefited from only $8 million of business interruption gains, declined 170 basis points to 30.1% for the year, down from 31.8% in 2022 due to the trends discussed above.\nNet Income, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nand Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share\nNet income for Host Inc. was $752 million, an increase of $109 million, or 17.0%, from the prior year. The improvement was primarily due to improving operations at our hotels and an increase in gain on asset sales and gain on insurance settlements. These results led to an 18.2% increase in diluted earnings per common share for Host Inc. to $1.04. Adjusted EBITDA\nre,\nwhich excludes gain on sale of assets, among other items, increased 8.7% to $1,629 million. Adjusted FFO per diluted share increased 7.3% to $1.92 in 2023, as the increase in Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nwas partially offset by an increase in interest expense (excluding debt extinguishment costs) and income taxes which are included in Adjusted FFO per diluted share but not Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n.\nThe trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. affected similarly the operating results for Host L.P., as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the unaffiliated limited partners of Host L.P.\n2024 Outlook\nWe continued to see positive momentum in the lodging industry throughout 2023, as the U.S. economy remained resilient despite the sharp increase in interest rates.  As the year progressed, inflation moderated even as unemployment remained at very low levels and consumer spending remained strong. U.S. lodging demand typically follows the growth of the U.S economy and is correlated to changes in gross domestic product (GDP). Moving into 2024, these results have led to increased optimism that inflation can be contained without leading to a recession. However, many risks to economic growth remain, including the continued effects of tight monetary policy and the Federal Reserve's decisions around interest rates, geopolitical instability throughout the globe, volatile oil prices and the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election. As a result, while the overall expectation of a recession has moderated, a slowdown in economic growth is anticipated. Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus currently estimates an increase in real U.S. GDP of 2.1% for 2024, reflecting a deceleration from 2023 growth of 2.5%. Business investment growth is also anticipated to slow over the coming quarters, averaging 2.1% for 2024, down from 4.4% in 2023.\nOverall, hotel supply growth is anticipated to remain below the long-term historical average in 2024, although we expect to see above-average growth in a few markets where our hotels are located, such as New York and Austin. Supply chain challenges have resulted in project delays across the U.S., and a tight lending environment has created construction financing challenges for future projects. We anticipate that the new project pipeline will remain suppressed until macroeconomic concerns abate, and interest rates decline.\nAt the same time, demand patterns have normalized from the outsized impact of the pandemic on our industry, particularly in luxury and upper upscale hotels in top U.S. markets where our hotels are located. The majority of our urban markets steadily improved in 2023, reflecting increases in group business and a gradual recovery in business transient and international demand. However, transient demand has recovered more slowly in certain markets, specifically San Francisco and Seattle. In addition, the impact from the wildfires on the Maui market, one of our largest markets by revenues, has created challenges for anticipating performance levels in the coming months as the community rebuilds.\nBased on the trends noted, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR growth for the full year 2024 will be between 2.5% and 5.5%. In addition, we expect margins to decline in comparison to 2023, driven by higher wages and growth in insurance and real estate taxes. As unemployment remains historically low and the labor market is tight at the lower end of the wage scale, we anticipate another year of wage growth in the 4% to 5% range. However, the range of potential outcomes on the economy and the lodging industry specifically remains exceptionally wide, reflecting varying analyst assumptions surrounding the impact of higher interest rates, inflation, ongoing labor shortages in key industries, and escalating geopolitical conflicts.\nAs noted above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains highly uncertain; therefore, there can be no assurances as to the continued recovery in lodging demand for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated return of group and business travel or deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. For more information on the risks that can affect our future results, see\n“Risk Factors.”\n41\nStrategic Initiatives\nIn 2023, we completed significant multi-year initiatives driven by our three strategic objectives, as follows, and believe we will continue to realize the benefits from our ongoing efforts: (i) redefining the hotel operating model with our managers through the implementation of portfolio-wide cost reductions, (ii) gaining market share through comprehensive renovations, including the Marriott and other transformational projects, discussed below, (iii) and strategically allocating capital to development ROI projects, including the new tower at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples completed in 2023.\nFor 2024, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation to strengthen our portfolio and to deliver stockholder value through multiple levers, which may include, over time, acquiring hotels or investing in our portfolio. We intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise. At the same time, we will opportunistically sell hotels when market conditions permit. We also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate for its highest and best use.\nCapital Projects.\nWe continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. During 2023, we spent approximately $646 million on capital expenditures, of which $195 million represented return on investment (“ROI”) capital expenditures, $274 million represented renewal and replacement projects and $177 million was for hurricane restoration work. Major capital projects completed during the year include transformational renovations at Fairmont Kea Lani, Maui, with upgrades to all guestrooms and the addition of a new arrival experience and lobby bar, and The Westin Georgetown, Washington D.C., with guestroom, public space and meeting space renovations. In July 2023, The Ritz-Carlton, Naples reopened, including the guestrooms, suites and amenities, and the new tower expansion. The final phase of reconstruction at Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa, the resort's waterpark, was completed in June 2023.\nIn addition, hotels within certain regions are subject to environmental and weather-related events, including hurricanes, wildfires, floods, rising sea levels, mudslides, earthquakes, and other natural perils. To mitigate some of these physical risks, we execute capital expenditure projects, including replacements and restorations of exterior walls, doors and windows, roofs, grounds, relocated/elevated critical equipment and distributed energy systems to further increase the resilience of our hotels. A portion of our capital expenditures for 2023 include these types of projects, which we expect to continue in future years. While the number of projects and overall cost varies from year to year, on average approximately 7% our capital expenditures have related to these types of projects over the past six years.\nIn 2023, we completed the Marriott transformational capital program, which began in 2018. We believe this program will position these hotels to be more competitive in their respective markets and will enhance long-term performance through increases in RevPAR and market yield index. We agreed to invest amounts in excess of the FF&E reserves required under our management agreements and, in exchange, Marriott has provided additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and $83 million in operating profit guarantees, before reductions for incentive management fees, to offset expected business disruption.\nThe Marriott transformational capital program included 16 hotels, which were completed as follows: projects at the Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Marriott Marquis, and Santa Clara Marriott in 2019; projects at the Minneapolis Marriott City Center, San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in 2020; projects at The Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island, New York Marriott Marquis and Orlando World Center Marriott in 2021; projects at Boston Marriott Copley Place, Houston Marriott Medical Center, JW Marriott Houston by the Galleria, and Marina del Rey Marriott in 2022; and projects at the Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina and Washington Marriott at Metro Center in 2023.\nSimilar to the Marriott transformational capital program, we reached an agreement with Hyatt in 2023 to complete transformational reinvestment capital projects at six properties in our portfolio, the Grand Hyatt Atlanta in Buckhead, Grand Hyatt Washington, Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego, Hyatt Regency Austin, Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill, and Hyatt Regency Reston. These investments are intended to position the targeted hotels to compete better in their respective markets while seeking to enhance long-term performance. The total investment is expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million, two-thirds of which we were planning to invest as part of our capital plan over the next few years. We expect to invest between $125 million and $200 million per year over the next three to four years\n42\non this program. Hyatt has agreed to provide additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees totaling $40 million to offset expected business disruptions.\nFor 2024, we expect total capital expenditures of $500 million to $605 million, consisting of ROI projects of approximately $225 million to $280 million, renewal and replacement expenditures of $250 million to $300 million, and $25 million for the final restoration work from the damage caused by Hurricane Ian. The ROI projects include approximately $125 million to $150 million for the new Hyatt transformational capital program discussed above.\nAlso in 2023, we announced and broke ground on a project to develop and sell 40 fee-simple condominiums on a five-acre development parcel at Golden Oak in Orlando, adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort. Construction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025. In 2023, we spent $15 million in development costs for this project. For 2024, the development costs for this project are expected to be $50 million to $70 million.\nDispositions\n.\nDuring 2023, we sold The Camby, Autograph Collection for $110 million, including a $72\nmillion loan we provided to the buyer. Up to an additional $12 million in funding is also available to the buyer under the loan for property improvement plan financing.\nFinancing transactions\n.\nWe believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy. In January 2023, we amended our credit facility, extending the maturity date and adding a sustainability pricing adjustment that can adjust the applicable interest rate. As of December 31, 2023, we have a debt balance of $4.2 billion, our weighted average interest rate is 4.5%, and our weighted average debt maturity is 4.2 years.\nFor a detailed discussion, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” For a detailed discussion of our significant debt activities, see Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5. Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShare Repurchase and Dividends.\nIn 2023, we repurchased 11.4 million shares at an average price of $15.93 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $181 million, under our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2023, we have $792 million available for repurchase under the program\n.\nDuring 2023, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $0.90 per share on its common stock, including a fourth quarter special dividend of $0.25 per share. Accordingly, Host L.P. made distributions of $0.9193446 per unit with respect to its common OP units for 2023. On February 21, 2024, we announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share on our common stock. The dividend will be paid on April 15, 2024 to stockholders of record on March 28, 2024\n.\nThe amount of any future dividends will be based on our policy of distributing, over time, 100% of our taxable income and will be determined by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors.\nThere can be no assurances that any future dividends will match or exceed those set forth above for any number of reasons, including a decline in operations or an increase in liquidity needs. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to fund our capital expenditures programs and to take advantage of investment opportunities.\n43\nResults of Operations\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations for the two years ended December 31, 2023 (in millions, except percentages):\n___________\n(1)\nAmounts represent total operating costs and expenses from our audited consolidated statements of operations, less corporate and other expenses and gain on insurance settlements.\nStatement of Operations Results and Trends\nOperations improved in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting (i) an increase in occupancy, particularly at our convention and downtown properties, (ii) easier comparisons to 2022, as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 significantly impaired travel during January and the first part of February in 2022 as noted previously, and (iii) the net impact of our recent acquisition and dispositions. The Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole, which we acquired in November 2022, contributed $70 million to growth in revenues in 2023, compared to the negative impact on revenues resulting from the disposition of a total of five properties in 2022 and 2023. The growth in 2023 was also impacted by lost revenues due to the closure of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which is included in non-comparable hotels as a result of Hurricane Ian, and due to the August wildfires in Maui.\nThe following table presents revenues in accordance with GAAP for the two years ended December 31, 2023 (in millions, except percentages):\nRooms\n. Total rooms revenues increased $230 million, or 7.6%, in 2023, reflecting the acquisition of the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole and the increase at our comparable hotels of $237 million, or 8.1%, due to increases in both average room rates and occupancy compared to 2022. Total rooms revenues were negatively affected by dispositions and the closure of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples from September 2022 to July 2023.\n44\nFood and beverage\n. Total food and beverage (\"F&B\") revenues increased $164 million, or 11.6%, in 2023. The improvement reflects the increase at our comparable hotels of $155 million, or 11.3%, primarily driven by improvements in banquet and audio-visual revenues at convention hotels as group demand continued to recover, partially offset by lost business as a result of the Maui wildfires, which had a larger impact on ancillary spend as compared to room revenues. Total F&B revenues for 2023 benefited from improved operations following the reopening of our non-comparable hotels after Hurricane Ian, and, similar to the changes in rooms revenues, the acquisition of the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole.\nOther revenues\n. Total other revenues increased $10 million, or 2.1%, in 2023. The increase reflects the increase at our comparable hotels of $4 million, or 0.9%, primarily due to an increase in ancillary revenues from improved occupancy levels and continued strong golf and spa revenues, which remain significantly ahead of pre-pandemic levels, and the acquisition of the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole. The increase was partially offset by normalizing, but still elevated, attrition and cancelation fees, the effects of the wildfires in Maui and the closure of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples.\nProperty-level Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents consolidated property-level operating expenses in accordance with GAAP for the two years ended December 31, 2023 (in millions, except percentages):\nOur operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by several factors. Rooms expenses are affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues and are affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet, audio-visual and outlet sales. However, the most significant expense for the rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 55% of these expenses in any given year. During 2023, these expenses increased 13% compared to 2022, reflecting an increase in hiring as operations have recovered, as well as wage and benefit inflationary pressures. In addition, early in 2022, hiring was temporarily paused in many areas due to the Omicron variant, as well as seasonality in certain markets, followed by an acceleration in demand for which our hotel managers were unable to increase staffing commensurate with the increase in demand. This led to a greater increase in expenses in 2023 on a year-over-year basis then would be expected due to increased demand alone. Hiring pace has since improved, and managers at the majority of our hotels now are operating at desired staffing levels. Wage and benefit rate inflation is expected to be approximately 4% to 5% in 2024.\nOther property-level expenses consist of property taxes, which are highly dependent on local jurisdiction taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.\nThe increase in expenses for rooms, food and beverage, other departmental and support, and management fees was generally due to the corresponding increase in revenues from improvements in occupancy and hotel operations, and an increase in staffing, as follows:\nRooms\n. Rooms expenses increased $60 million, or 8.3%, in 2023. Our comparable hotels rooms expenses increased $67 million, or 9.5%, in 2023. These increases reflect the increase in occupancy and staffing described above. Total rooms expenses benefited from the net impact of our recent acquisition and dispositions. Wages and benefits represented approximately 67% and 65% of our 2023 and 2022 rooms expenses, respectively.\n45\nFood and beverage.\nF&B expenses increased $114 million, or 12.3%, in 2023. For our comparable hotels, F&B expenses increased $109 million, or 12.3%, in 2023. Overall, F&B costs as a percentage of revenues increased slightly, as staffing levels normalized. Wages and benefits represented approximately 69% and 67% of our 2023 and 2022 F&B expenses, respectively.\nOther departmental and support expenses\n. Other departmental and support expenses increased $99 million, or 8.4%, in 2023. On a comparable hotel basis, other departmental and support expenses increased $102 million, or 8.9%. These increases were primarily due to the increase in staffing. Total other departmental and support expenses benefited from the net impact of our recent acquisition and dispositions. Wages and benefits represented approximately 40% of our 2023 and 2022 other departmental and support expenses.\nManagement fees\n. Total management fees increased $32 million, or 14.7%, in 2023. Base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, increased $10 million, or 7.1%, compared to 2022. At our comparable hotels, base management fees increased $9 million, or 6.3%, for 2023. Incentive management fees, which generally are based on the amount of operating profit at each hotel after we receive a priority return on our investment, increased $22 million, due primarily to the improved operations at our properties. At our comparable hotels, incentive management fees increased $18 million, or 21.8%, in 2023.\nOther property-level expenses\n. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. Other property-level expenses increased $58 million, or 17.8%, in 2023, due to increases in property insurance premiums, rent on a portion of our ground leases that are based on a percentage of sales, and property taxes. Other property-level expenses at our comparable hotels increased $52 million, or 16.3%, in 2023. Other property-level expenses were partially offset by the receipt of operating profit guarantees from Marriott under the transformational capital program in both 2023 and 2022.\nOther Income and Expenses\nCorporate and other expenses\n.\nCorporate and other expenses include the following items (in millions):\nGeneral and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. Increases in 2023 primarily reflect growth in compensation and litigation accruals.\nGain on insurance settlements.\nIn 2023, we recorded a gain on insurance consisting of $3 million related to property insurance proceeds and $83 million for receipt of business interruption proceeds, primarily relating to Hurricane Ian. In 2022, we recorded a gain on insurance consisting of $6 million related to property insurance proceeds and $11 million for receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds, each relating to various claims at our properties.\n46\nInterest expense\n.\nInterest expense increased $35 million, or 22.4%, in 2023 as compared to 2022, due to an increase in average interest rates on our floating rate debt. The following table presents certain components of interest expense (in millions):\n___________\n(1)\nTotal cash interest expense paid was $183 million and $142 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, which includes an increase(decrease) due to the change in accrued interest of $2 million and $(4) million for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther gains.\nThe following table presents the gains recognized on the sale of assets and other (in millions):\nEquity in earnings of affiliates\n. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $3 million, or 100.0%, in 2023, reflecting less unrealized losses recorded at our investment in Fifth Wall Ventures, L.P. in 2023 compared to 2022, partially offset by losses at our Maui timeshare joint venture due to the Maui wildfires in August 2023.\nProvision for income taxes.\nWe lease substantially all our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable income or loss generated/incurred by the TRS primarily represents hotel-level operations and the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. In 2023 and 2022, we recorded an income tax provision of $36 million and $26 million, respectively, due primarily to the profitability of hotel operations retained by the TRS, including the business interruption insurance gains recorded in 2023 and 2022. As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act in 2020, a portion of the 2020 domestic net operating loss was carried back to 2017-2019 in order to procure a refund of U.S. federal corporate income taxes previously paid. The remaining portion of the 2020 net operating loss, as well as the entire 2021 net operating loss incurred by our TRS, may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit on the use thereof equal to 80% of annual taxable income. See also Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7. Income Taxes” for a discussion of our income taxes.\n47\nComparable Hotel RevPAR Overview\nEffective January 1, 2023, we ceased presentation of All Owned Hotel results, and returned to a comparable hotel presentation for our hotel level results. Comparable hotels are those properties that we consolidate as of the reporting date. Comparable hotels do not include the results of hotels sold or classified as held-for-sale, hotels that have sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or hotels that have undergone large-scale capital projects, in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer during the reporting periods being compared. We believe this provides investors with a better understanding of underlying growth trends for our current portfolio, without impact from properties that experienced closures. We have removed Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa and The Ritz-Carlton, Naples from our comparable operations for 2023 due to closures caused by Hurricane Ian. See “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” below for more information on how we determine our comparable hotels.\nWe also include, following the comparable hotels results by geographic location, the same operating statistics presentation on an actual basis, which includes results for our portfolio for the time period of our ownership, including the results of non-comparable properties, dispositions through their date of disposal and acquisitions beginning as of the date of acquisition. Lastly, we discuss our hotel results by mix of business (i.e., transient, group, or contract).\nHotel Operating Data by Location\n.\nThe following table sets forth performance information for our hotels by geographic location as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 on a comparable hotel and actual basis:\nComparable Hotel Results by Location\n48\nResults by Location - actual, based on ownership period\n(1)\n___________\n(1)\nRepresents the results of the portfolio for the time period of our ownership, including the results of non-comparable properties, dispositions through their date of disposal and acquisitions beginning as of the date of acquisition.\nHotel Sales by Business Mix.\nThe majority of our customers fall into three broad categories: transient, group and contract business. The information below is derived from business mix results from the 75 comparable hotels owned as of December 31, 2023.\nImprovements in 2023 compared to 2022 were primarily driven by an increase in group business, through increases in occupancy and room rates. At the same time, the recovery in business transient demand continued, driven by demand from small and medium-sized businesses, which accounted for a greater share of demand after the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to demand from large companies. Business transient demand improvement was partially offset by weaker leisure demand due to the effects of the wildfires in Maui and moderating transient rates at our resort hotels, although resort transient rates still remain more than 50% above 2019.\n49\nThe following are the results of our transient, group and contract business:\n50\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nThe liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are derived primarily from the activities of Host L.P., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of OP units or the sale of hotels. Host Inc. is a REIT and its only significant asset is the ownership of general and limited partner interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. Proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for common and preferred OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase its stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion below applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nOverview.\nWe look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility of the lodging industry. We believe this strategy has resulted in a better cost of debt capital, allowing us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and positioning us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. We have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. Currently, only one of our consolidated hotels is encumbered by mortgage debt. Over the past several years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result, the company was well positioned at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to withstand the severe slowdown in U.S. economic activity and lodging demand brought on by the pandemic. We intend to use available cash in the near term predominantly to fund, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund, corporate expenses, capital expenditures, hotel acquisitions and dividends and remain well positioned to execute additional investment transactions to the extent opportunities arise.\nCash Requirements.\nWe use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, and corporate and other expenses, as well as for dividends and distributions to stockholders and Host L.P. limited partners and stock and OP unit repurchases. Our primary sources of cash include cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. In the short term, our cash obligations include $400 million of senior notes due in April of 2024. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay them with available cash at maturity, or we can refinance the notes with our access to capital markets. For our long-term senior note and credit facility obligations, we historically have refinanced these amounts prior to their maturity through the issuance of new senior notes or the entry into new credit facility agreements. Whether we will refinance the April 2024 senior notes upon maturity with new senior notes will depend upon market conditions generally, including the interest rate environment, and our cash requirements. As discussed further below, we amended our credit facility effective January 4, 2023, extending the maturity date among other things. Also, in the short term, our cash obligations include the minimum lease payments on our ground leases, which in 2024 are approximately $31 million, and most of our other operating obligations. In the long term, our ground lease payments are the longest time horizon obligations and currently run up to 89 years. For a summary of our obligations under our ground leases, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report.\nIn addition to the liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, under our capital expenditures program, we have budgeted to spend $500 million to $605 million in 2024. Commitments for capital expenditures generally run less than two years for the life of the project. In the long term, renewal and replacement (\"R&R\") capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels and typically occur at intervals of seven to ten years. The projects are primarily funded through the FF&E reserves established at each hotel. Average annual R&R spend over the last five years has been $232 million.\nOur 2024 capital expenditures budget includes approximately $25 million for restoration work following Hurricane Ian in September 2022, primarily at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. While all of our hotels have fully reopened, we have continued our restoration efforts, for which we estimate the total property reconstruction and remediation costs, including significant enhancements, to be approximately $300 million to $320 million of which approximately 30% relates to remediation costs. As of December 31, 2023, we have received $213 million of insurance proceeds related to these claims, of which $80 million has been recognized as a gain on business interruption, with any remaining proceeds expected to be received in 2024. Our expected potential insurance recovery is $310 million for covered costs, including the property remediation and reconstruction costs and the near-term loss of business; however, there can be no assurances that we will be able to collect the full amount.\n51\nAs part of our investment in our Noble joint venture, we have made a $211.5 million capital commitment to Noble Fund V. As of December 31, 2023, we have funded $33 million of this commitment, with the remaining amounts to be paid as the fund calls them.\nAs a REIT, Host Inc. is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. See also Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17. Legal Proceedings, Guarantees and Contingencies” for a discussion of obligations under contingent liabilities or guarantees and a more detailed description of the damage caused by Hurricane Ian.\nCapital Resources.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $1,144 million of cash and cash equivalents, $217 million in our FF&E escrow reserve and $1.5 billion available under the revolver portion of our credit facility. In the near term, we expect to fund our above cash requirements, including our dividends, capital expenditures program, debt service and operating and corporate costs, primarily through hotel operations and our existing cash reserves. Based on our cash balance at December 31, 2023 and our expected cash obligations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our near-term obligations. Future acquisitions and/or obligations also may be funded through a draw on the available portion of the revolver under our credit facility, equity issuances, or asset sales.\nWe depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Our financial flexibility, including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends, make distributions and make investments, is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility and senior notes, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges.\nThe following graph summarizes our aggregate debt maturities as of February 23, 2024:\n___________\n(1)\nThe first term loan under our credit facility that is due in 2027 has an extension option that would extend maturity of the instrument to 2028, subject to meeting certain conditions, including payment of a fee. The second term loan tranche that is due in 2028 does not have an extension option.\n(2)\nMortgage and other debt excludes principal amortization of $2 million each year from 2024-2027 for the mortgage loan that matures in 2027.\nGiven the total amount of our debt and our maturity schedule, we may continue to redeem or repurchase senior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. In February 2023, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of senior notes other than in accordance with their respective terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the accelerated expensing of\n52\npreviously deferred and capitalized financing costs. Accordingly, considering our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws and the requirements of our credit facility and senior notes, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of our common stock. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously.\nTwo programs currently are in place relating to purchases and sales of our common stock. First, on May 31, 2023, we entered into a distribution agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents pursuant to which Host Inc. may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of Host Inc. common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $600 million. The sales will be made in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings under the SEC rules. We may sell shares of Host Inc. common stock under this program from time to time based on market conditions, although we are not under an obligation to sell any shares. We may sell shares when we believe conditions are advantageous and there is a compelling use of proceeds, including to fund future potential acquisitions or other investment opportunities. The agreement also contemplates that, in addition to the offering and sale of shares to or through the sales agents, we may enter into separate forward sale agreements with each of the forward purchasers named in the agreement. No shares were issued in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, there was $600 million of remaining capacity under the agreement.\nSecond, in August 2022, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized an increase in the existing program to repurchase Host Inc. common stock up to $1 billion. The common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions and may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options, and similar transactions and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number or any specific dollar amount of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at an average price of $16.50, exclusive of commissions, for a purchase price of approximately $31 million. For full year 2023, we repurchased 11.4 million shares at an average price of $15.93 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $181 million.  At December 31, 2023, we had $792 million available for repurchase under the program.\nWe continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. We anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded by cash, debt issuances by Host L.P., equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., or proceeds from sales of hotels. Given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our hotels. We may acquire additional hotels or dispose of hotels through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders.\nSources and Uses of Cash.\nIn 2023, our primary sources of cash included cash from operations and proceeds from the repayment of notes receivable and asset sales. Our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of capital expenditures, operating costs, share repurchases and distributions to equity holders. We anticipate that our sources and uses of cash will be similar in 2024, other than the proceeds from the two notes receivable that were repaid in 2023.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\n. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2023 was $1,441 million, an increase of $25 million compared to 2022, reflecting the improved operations at our hotels compared to 2022, along with remediation insurance proceeds which exceeded remediation costs incurred in 2023.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\n. Approximately $183 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2023 compared to $618 million in 2022. In addition to the acquisition and disposition activity detailed in the charts below, cash used in investing activities included $646 million of capital expenditures in 2023, compared to $504 million in 2022. These amounts include certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditures projects that have been capitalized in accordance with GAAP. These capitalized costs were $24 million, $20 million and $13 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n53\nThe following tables summarize significant acquisitions, dispositions and investments in affiliates from January 1, 2022 through February 23, 2024 (in millions):\n___________\n(1)\nInvestment amount represents total consideration, including the assumption of $19 million of hotel-level liabilities, net of $5 million of cash retained at the property.\n(2)\nInvestment consisted of $35 million of cash and the issuance of approximately $56 million of Host L.P. OP units.\n___________\n(1)\nProceeds are net of transfer taxes, other sales costs and FF&E replacement funds deposited directly to the property or hotel manager by the purchaser.\n(2)\nIn connection with the sale of the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel, we extended a $250 million bridge loan to the purchaser. The loan was repaid in November 2023.\n(3)\nIn connection with the sale of the Sheraton Boston, we extended a $163 million bridge loan to the purchaser. The loan was repaid in September 2023.\n(4)\nIn connection with the sale of The Camby, Autograph Collection, we issued a $72 million loan to the purchaser. The disposition proceeds shown are net of the loan.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\n. Net cash used in financing activities was $771 million for 2023, compared to $874 million in 2022. Cash used in financing activities in 2023 primarily related to the payment of common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash used in financing activities in 2022 included a repayment on the revolver portion of the credit facility and payment of common stock dividends, following the reinstatement of the quarterly common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2022, as well as the repurchase of common stock.\nEquity/Capital Transactions.\nThe following table summarizes significant equity transactions that have been completed from January 1, 2022 through February 23, 2024 (in millions):\n___________\n(1)\nOur dividend payment for the fourth quarter of 2023 was made in January 2024, but was accrued at December 31, 2023.\n54\n(2)\nIn connection with the dividend payments, Host L.P. made distributions of $321 million, $555 million and $152 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to its common OP unit holders.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2023, our total debt was approximately $4.2 billion, of which 76% carried a fixed rate of interest. Total debt was comprised of the following (in millions):\n___________\n(1)\nThere were no outstanding credit facility borrowings at December 31, 2023 or 2022. Amount shown represents deferred financing costs related to the credit facility revolver.\nAggregate debt maturities, including principal amortization, at December 31, 2023 are as follows (in millions):\nSenior Notes.\nThe following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indenture governing the various senior notes issued by Host L.P. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.’s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P. Currently there are no guarantees provided with respect to the senior notes, but we have agreed that all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee other Host L.P. debt must similarly provide guarantees with respect to the senior notes.\n55\nAll of our outstanding senior notes at December 31, 2023 were issued after we attained an investment grade rating and have covenants customary for investment grade debt and covenants that are similar to each other series of our senior notes. These covenants are primarily limitations on our ability to incur additional debt. There are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nUnder the terms of our senior notes, Host L.P.’s ability to incur debt is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by Host L.P. As calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on Host L.P.’s audited consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is based on Host L.P.’s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.’s ability to incur debt include maintaining total debt of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured debt of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured debt of Host L.P. and its subsidiaries. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have met the minimum financial covenant levels under our senior notes indentures. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2023:\nCredit Facility.\nOn January 4, 2023, we entered into the sixth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion. The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $1 billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to add in the future $500 million of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nThe revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of January 4, 2027, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of either a 1-year extension option or two 6-month extension options, each of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. One $500 million term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of January 4, 2027, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of one 1-year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $500 million term loan tranche has a maturity date of January 4, 2028, which date may not be extended.\nNeither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity. The term loans are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).\nGuarantees.\nSimilar to our senior note indenture, the credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guaranty Host L.P. senior unsecured debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees.\n56\nPrepayments.\nVoluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty.\nFinancial Covenants.\nThe credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. We are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (“leverage ratio”) is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. These calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, and non-cash interest expense, all of which are included in interest expense on our audited consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance.\nWe are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2023:\n___________\n(1)\nIf at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio requirement will decrease to 1.50x.\nInterest and Fees.\nThe amendment also converted the underlying reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points. We pay interest on U.S. dollar revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to SOFR (plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points) plus a margin ranging from 72.5 to 140 basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). We also pay a facility fee on the total $1.5 billion revolver commitment ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. We also may elect to pay interest on revolver and term loan borrowings using a base rate plus a margin that is similarly determined based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating. The credit facility includes a sustainability pricing adjustment that can result in a change in the interest rate applicable to borrowings. The adjustment can result in an increase or decrease of the interest rate for revolving loans of up to 4 basis points and an increase or decrease of the facility fee of up to 1 basis point. In the case of the term loans, the adjustment can result in an increase or decrease of the interest rate applicable of up to 5 basis points. The adjustments will be determined annually on the basis of an annual audited report of Host L.P.’s performance against targets established in the credit facility for (1) the percentage of our consolidated portfolio with green building certifications and (2) the percentage of electricity used at all our consolidated properties that is generated by renewable resources. Effective June 30, 2023, we achieved a milestone in the progress towards our renewable energy goal, resulting in the applicable basis point reduction in the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility. Based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2023, we are able to borrow on the revolver at a rate of adjusted SOFR plus 85 basis points less 2 basis points for meeting sustainability milestones for an all-in rate of 6.29% and pay a facility fee of 19.5 basis points.\nInterest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to SOFR (plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points) plus a margin ranging from 80 to 160 basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating) and adjusted for sustainability pricing. Based on Host L.P.’s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2023, our applicable margin on SOFR loans under both term loans is 95 basis points less 2.5 basis points for meeting sustainability milestones, for an all-in rate of 6.39%.\nOther Covenants and Events of Default.\nThe credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x. At any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on the incurrence of debt\nincorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture.\n57\nThe credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders’ commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders’ commitments automatically will terminate.\nMortgage Debt, Including Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.\nAt December 31, 2023, we own one consolidated property that is encumbered by mortgage debt. All of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets, except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2023, our mortgage debt has an interest rate of 4.67% and matures in 2027, with principal and interest payments due monthly. We also own non-controlling interests in joint ventures that are not consolidated and that are accounted for under the equity method. The portion of the mortgage and other debt of these joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $208 million at December 31, 2023. The debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures is non-recourse to us.\nDistributions/Dividends\n.\nHost Inc.’s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as on tax gains and losses on hotel sales. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Host Inc. paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.25 per share on its common stock on January 16, 2024 to stockholders of record as of December 29, 2023. Any future dividend will be subject to approval by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors.\nFunds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends are provided by distributions from Host L.P. As of December 31, 2023, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately 99% of Host L.P.’s common OP units. The remaining common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Each OP unit may be offered for redemption by the limited partners for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. The current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit.\nInvestors should consider the 1% non-controlling position of Host L.P. OP units when analyzing dividend payments by Host Inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of OP units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host L.P. to holders of its OP units. For example, if Host Inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common OP unit distribution by Host L.P. to Host Inc., as well as to the other common OP unitholders.\nCounterparty Credit Risk.\nWe are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. We assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility. We believe our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. We also have counter-party credit risk with respect to our outstanding note receivable, although upon event of a default of the notes, we would seek to enforce our rights against the collateral in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of the critical accounting policy related to impairment testing on our property and equipment, which requires us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.\n58\nComparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results\nEffective January 1, 2023, we ceased presentation of All Owned Hotel results that was used while the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted operations, limiting the usefulness of year-over-year comparisons, and returned to a comparable hotel presentation for our hotel level results. We believe this provides investors with a better understanding of underlying growth trends for our current portfolio, without impact from properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage sustained.\nTo facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations, we present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects, in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below), during the reporting periods being compared.\nWe make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally, operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.\nThe hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally, hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.\nSimilarly, hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case, these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often, related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel, we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.\nOf the 77 hotels that we owned as of December 31, 2023, 75 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of December 31, 2023 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:\n•\nHyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort & Spa (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022, reopened in November 2022);\n•\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022, reopened in July 2023); and\n•\nSales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.\nForeign Currency Translation\nOperating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore, hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures are as follows: (i) EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nas a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., (ii) Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and (iii) comparable hotel operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n59\nWe calculate EBITDA\nre\nand NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDA\nre\nand FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDA\nre\nand FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDA\nre,\nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\npurposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration\nand other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDA\nre,\nAdjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nshould not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.\nSimilarly, EBITDA\nre\n, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO include adjustments for non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host L.P. held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA\nre\nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nare calculated as set forth below. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic consequences of our investments in these entities. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nEBITDA\nEarnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nWe present EBITDA\nre\nin accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDA\nre\nas net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDA\nre\nof unconsolidated affiliates.\n60\nWe make additional adjustments to EBITDA\nre\nwhen evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nalso is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDA\nre\nfor the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n:\n•\nProperty Insurance Gains\n– We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nis not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.\n•\nAcquisition Costs\n– Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.\n•\nLitigation Gains and Losses\n– We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.\n•\nSeverance Expense\n– In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.\nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDA\nre\nfor gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.\n61\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nto net income, the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider the most directly comparable:\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nfor Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n(in millions)\n___________\n(1)\nReflects the sale of one hotel in 2023 and four hotels in 2022.\n(2)\nUnrealized gains of our unconsolidated investments are not recognized in our EBITDA\nre,\nAdjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO or Adjusted FFO until they have been realized by the unconsolidated partnership.\nFFO Measures\nWe present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.\nWe believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.\nWe also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors\n62\nregarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:\n•\nGains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt\n– We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.\n•\nAcquisition Costs\n–Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.\n•\nLitigation Gains and Losses\n– We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.\n•\nSeverance Expense –\nIn certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.\nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance.\nFor example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.\n63\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between our non-GAAP financial measures, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO (separately and on a per diluted share basis), and net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable:\nHost Inc. Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings per Common Share to\nNAREIT and Adjusted Funds From Operations per Diluted Share\n(in millions, except per share amount)\n\\\n__________\n(1-2)\nRefer to the corresponding footnote on the Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n(3)\nDiluted earnings per common share, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share are adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, preferred OP units held by non-controlling limited partners and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partner interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for securities if they are anti-dilutive.\nComparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results\nWe present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a comparable hotel, or \"same store,\" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage, as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented\n64\nboth by location and for our properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.\nBecause of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.\nWe present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.\n65\nThe following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein:\nComparable Hotel Results for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n(in millions, except hotel statistics)\n___________\n(1)\nProfit margins are calculated by dividing the applicable operating profit by the related revenue amount. GAAP profit margins are calculated using amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations. Comparable hotel margins are calculated using amounts presented in the following tables, which include reconciliations to the applicable GAAP results:\n66\n(2)     Property transaction adjustments represent the following items: (i) the elimination of results of operations of hotels sold or held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023, which operations are included in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as continuing operations, and (ii) the addition of results for periods prior to our ownership for hotels acquired as of December 31, 2023.\n(3)     Non-comparable hotel results, net, includes the following items: (i) the results of operations of our non-comparable hotels, which operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations as continuing operations, and (ii) gains on business interruption proceeds relating to events that occurred while the hotels were classified as non-comparable."

    "text": "All information in this section applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur future income, cash flows and fair values with respect to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We have no derivative financial instruments that are held for trading purposes. We use derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks. As of February 23, 2024, we do not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding.\n67\nThe interest payments on 76% of our debt are fixed in nature. Valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are determined based on expected future payments, discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The senior notes are valued based on quoted market prices. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by 100 basis points, interest expense would increase or decrease, respectively, our earnings and cash flows by approximately $10 million in 2024. The table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates (in millions, except percentages):\n___________\n(1)\nThe amounts are net of unamortized discounts, premiums and deferred financing costs; therefore, negative amounts prior to maturity represent the amortization of original issue discounts and deferred financing costs.\n(2)\nThe interest rate for our floating rate payments is based on the rate in effect as of December 31, 2023. No adjustments are made for forecast changes in the rate.\nExchange Rate Sensitivity\nWe have currency exchange risk because of our hotel ownership in Brazil and Canada and our minority investment in a joint venture in India. We may utilize several strategies to mitigate the exposure of currency exchange risk for our portfolio, including (i) utilizing local currency denominated debt (including foreign currency draws on our credit facility), (ii) entering into forward or option foreign currency purchase contracts, or (iii) investing through partnership and joint venture structures. For 2023 and 2022, revenues from our consolidated foreign operations were $92 million and $71 million, respectively, or approximately 2% and 1%, respectively, of our total revenues.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, three foreign currency forward purchase contracts matured, with a total notional amount of CAD 99 million ($75 million), and we received $1.9 million in the aggregate upon settlement of these contracts. In replacement of the maturing contracts, we entered into three new foreign currency forward purchase contracts with the same total notional amount of CAD 99 million ($74 million), which will mature in August 2024. The foreign currency exchange agreements into which we have entered strictly are to hedge foreign currency risk and are not for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of these contracts was $(1.2) million. These contracts are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) for contracts designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, and through net income for contracts acting as a natural hedge of intercompany loans. The foreign currency forward sale contracts are valued based on the forward yield curve of the foreign currency to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate on the date of measurement. Pursuant to these contracts, we will sell the foreign currency amount, as applicable, and receive the U.S. dollar amount on the forward sale date. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the derivatives.\n68"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of hotel properties for impairment\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, property and equipment, less accumulated depreciation and amortization as of December 31, 2023, was $9,624 million. The Company assesses its property and equipment, primarily comprised of hotel properties, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances are identified, the Company performs a recoverability analysis to compare the carrying amount of the hotel property to its expected undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining useful life.\nWe identified the evaluation of hotel properties for impairment as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the events or changes in circumstances that the Company used to evaluate its expected hold period. In addition, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the key assumptions used by the Company in the recoverability analysis for a certain hotel property. The key assumptions included the undiscounted future cash flows and the expected hold period of this hotel property. Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows for this hotel property required specialized skills and knowledge.\n70\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the impairment process. This included controls over the identification and assessment of expected hold periods for certain hotel properties and over the undiscounted future cash flows used by the Company in the recoverability analysis for a certain hotel property. We evaluated the expected hold periods, by:\n●    inquiring of management and obtaining written representations regarding potential property disposal plans, if any\n●    reading minutes of the meetings of the Company’s board of directors\n●    inquiring about the Company’s plans with those in the organization who are responsible for, and have authority over, potential disposition activities\n●    comparing management’s assessment of properties with potential shortened expected hold periods to information obtained from those in the organization responsible for disposition activity, and\n●    inspecting listings from external sources of real estate properties for sale by the Company.\nWe also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the undiscounted future cash flows of a certain hotel property by comparing the cash flows to publicly available market data.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nMcLean, Virginia\nFebruary 28, 2024\n71\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nHost Hotels & Resorts, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nMcLean, Virginia\nFebruary 28, 2024\n72\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Partners of Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. and Board of Directors of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. and subsidiaries (the Partnership) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, operates through an umbrella partnership structure, with Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., a Maryland corporation, as its sole general partner. In the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we use the terms “we” or “our” to refer to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. together, unless the context indicates otherwise. We also use the term “Host Inc.” to refer specifically to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and the term “Host L.P.” to refer specifically to Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. in cases where it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P. Host Inc. holds approximately\n99\n% of Host L.P.’s partnership interests, or OP units.\nConsolidated Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2023, the hotels in our consolidated portfolio are in the following countries:\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Host Inc., Host L.P. and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, including joint ventures and partnerships. We consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to control them. For the majority of our hotel and real estate investments, we consider those control rights to be (i) approval or amendment of developments plans, (ii) financing decisions, (iii) approval or amendments of operating budgets, and (iv) investment strategy decisions.\nWe also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they are variable interest entities (“VIEs”). If a subsidiary is a VIE, it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for VIEs. Typically, the entity that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance consolidates the VIE. We consider an entity to be a VIE if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We review our subsidiaries and affiliates at least annually to determine (i) if they should be considered VIEs, and (ii) whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in the characteristics thereof.\nFour\npartnerships are considered VIE’s, as the general partner of these partnerships maintains control over the decisions that most significantly impact the partnerships. The first VIE is the operating partnership, Host L.P., which is consolidated by Host Inc., of which Host Inc. is the general partner and holds\n99\n% of the limited partner interests. Host Inc.’s sole significant asset is its investment in Host L.P. and substantially all of Host Inc.’s assets and liabilities represent assets and liabilities of Host L.P. All of Host Inc.’s debt is an obligation of Host L.P. and may be settled only with assets of Host L.P. The consolidated partnership that owns the Houston Airport Marriott at George Bush Intercontinental, of which we are the general partner and hold\n85\n% of the partnership interests, also is a VIE. The total assets of this VIE at December 31, 2023 are $\n50\nmillion and consist primarily of cash, a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and property and equipment. Liabilities for the VIE total $\n27\nmillion and primarily consist of a lease liability and accounts payable.\nTwo\nunconsolidated partnerships that own hotel properties, of which we hold limited partner interests ranging from\n11\n% -\n21\n%, also are VIEs. The combined carrying amount of our investments in these entities at December 31, 2023 is $\n23\nmillion and is included in advances to and investments in affiliates. The mortgage debt held by these VIEs is non-recourse to us.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\n87\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nand disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nProperty and Equipment\nGenerally, property and equipment is recorded at cost. For hotels that we develop, cost includes interest, property insurance and real estate taxes incurred during construction. For property and equipment acquired in a business combination, we record the assets acquired based on their fair value as of the acquisition date. Replacements and improvements and finance leases are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nProperties acquired in an asset acquisition are recorded at cost. The acquisition cost is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, as well as identifiable intangible and lease assets and liabilities. Acquisition cost is allocated using relative fair values. We evaluate several factors, including weighted market data for similar assets, expected future cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates, and replacement costs for assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair values.\nWe capitalize certain inventory (such as china, glass, silver, and linen) at the time of a hotel opening or acquisition, or when significant inventory is purchased (in conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded). These amounts then are amortized over the estimated useful life of\nthree years\n. Subsequent replacement purchases are expensed when placed in service.\nWe maintain a furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal and replacement capital expenditures at our hotels, which generally is funded with\n5\n% of property revenues.\nImpairment testing.\nWe analyze our consolidated hotels for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We test for impairment in several situations, including:\n•\nwhen a hotel has a current or projected loss from operations;\n•\nwhen management’s intent or ability to hold a property for a period that recovers its carrying value changes, making it more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life and therefore reducing the expected hold period, and the anticipated sales price is at or below the book value; or\n•\nwhen other events, trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nTo the extent that a hotel has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be sold prior to the end thereof, it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the property’s carrying amount. In the absence of other factors, we assume that the estimated useful life is equal to the remaining GAAP depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements. We adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise, such as an expiring ground lease, or that it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to the end of its previously expected useful life. We also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimated useful life of our properties, including critical infrastructure, which regularly is maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life.\nIn 2023, we identified\none\nproperty that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Based on this testing,\nno\nimpairment was necessary, and no further analysis was required.\nIn 2022 and 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operations, we performed recoverability tests on certain of our properties. No properties were impaired as a result of a decline in operations due to the pandemic. During\n88\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2021, as a result of the reduction in expected hold periods during the year, the book value for certain property and equipment exceeded its undiscounted future cash flows. Therefore, we recorded impairment expense of $\n92\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nClassification of Assets as Held for Sale.\nWe will classify a hotel as held for sale when its sale is probable, will be completed within one year and actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or it is unlikely that the sale will not occur. This policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale frequently are not known until purchase agreements are executed, the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist that could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. We typically classify hotels as held for sale when all the following conditions are met:\n•\nHost Inc.’s Board of Directors has approved the sale (to the extent that the dollar amount of the sale requires Board approval);\n•\na binding agreement to sell the property has been signed under which the buyer has deposited a significant amount of nonrefundable cash; and\n•\nno significant financing or legal contingencies exist that could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner.\nIf these criteria are met, we will cease recording depreciation expense and will record an impairment expense if the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the hotel. We will classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet. Gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or are deferred and recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without further cost to us.\nDiscontinued Operations.\nWe generally include the operations of a hotel that was sold or a hotel that has been classified as held for sale in continuing operations, including the gain or loss on the sale, unless the sale represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on our future operations and financial results.\nAsset retirement obligations.\nWe recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations, including environmental remediation liabilities, when incurred, which generally is upon acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of the asset, if information exists with which to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense.\nWe depreciate our property and equipment using the straight-line method. Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The useful lives of the assets are based on several assumptions, including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated useful lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels.\nIntangible Assets and Acquired Liabilities\nIn conjunction with our acquisitions, we may identify intangible assets and other liabilities. These identifiable intangible assets and other liabilities typically include above- and below-market contracts, including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value in a business combination and at its relative fair value in an asset acquisition. These contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of terms and conditions for similar contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the contract. Intangible assets and other liabilities are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the related agreements.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nHost Inc.’s treatment of the non-controlling interests of Host L.P.\nHost Inc. adjusts the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. each period so that the amount presented equals the greater of its carrying amount based on its historical cost\n89\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nor its redemption value. The historical cost is based on the proportional relationship between the historical cost of equity held by our common stockholders relative to that of the unitholders of Host L.P. The redemption value is based on the amount of cash or Host Inc. common stock, at our option, that would be paid to the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. if it were terminated. We have estimated that the redemption value is equivalent to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the OP units currently owned by unaffiliated limited partners (one OP unit may be exchanged for\n1.021494\nshares of Host Inc. common stock) valued at the market price of Host Inc. common stock at the balance sheet date. Redeemable non-controlling interests of Host L.P. are classified in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet as they do not meet the requirements for equity classification because the redemption feature requires the delivery of registered shares.\nThe table below details the historical cost and redemption values for the non-controlling interests of Host L.P.:\n_____\n(1)\nThe book value recorded is equal to the greater of the redemption value or the historical cost.\nNet income (loss) is allocated to the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. based on their weighted average ownership percentage during the period.\nNet income (loss) attributable to Host Inc. has been reduced by the amount attributable to non-controlling interests in Host L.P., which totaled $\n11\nmillion, $\n9\nmillion and $(\n1\n) million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOther Consolidated Partnerships.\nNon-redeemable non-controlling interests - other consolidated partnerships on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the third party partnership interest of\none\nmajority-owned partnership.\nInvestments in Affiliates\nDistributions from Investments in Affiliates.\nWe classify the distributions from our equity investments in the statements of cash flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances of each distribution. For example, distributions of cash that were generated by property operations are classified as cash flows from operating activities. However, distributions of cash that were generated by property sales and certain other transactions are classified as cash flows from investing activities.\nIncome Taxes\nHost Inc. elected to be treated as a REIT effective January 1, 1999 pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. It is our intention to continue to comply with the REIT qualification requirements and to maintain our qualification for treatment as a REIT. A corporation that elects REIT status and meets certain tax law requirements regarding the distribution of its taxable income to its stockholders as prescribed by applicable tax laws and that complies with certain other requirements (relating primarily to the composition of its assets and the sources of its gross income) generally is not subject to federal and state corporate income taxation on its operating income that is distributed to its stockholders. As a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Host L.P. is not subject to federal income tax. Host L.P. is, however, subject to state, local and foreign income and franchise tax in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, each of the Host L.P. taxable REIT subsidiaries is taxable as a C corporation, and is subject to federal, state and foreign corporate income tax. Our consolidated income tax provision (benefit) includes the income tax provision (benefit) related to the operations of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, and state, local, and foreign income taxes incurred by Host L.P. and its subsidiaries.\nDeferred\nTax Assets and Liabilities.\nPursuant to its partnership agreement, Host L.P. generally is required to reimburse Host Inc. for any tax payments it is required to make. Accordingly, the tax information included herein represents disclosures regarding Host Inc. and its subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the\n90\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nestimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss, general business credit, and capital loss carryovers. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nGAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. We must determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than\n50\n% likely of being realized upon settlement to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. This accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes. We recognize any accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.\nDeferred Charges\nFinancing costs related to long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method. These costs are presented as a direct deduction from the related long-term debt on the balance sheets.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAs of December 31, 2023, our foreign operations consist of hotels located in Brazil and Canada, as well as an investment in a joint venture that indirectly owns hotels in India. The financial statements of these hotels and our investments therein are maintained in their functional currency, which generally is the local currency, and their operations are translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the period. The assets and liabilities of the hotels and the investments therein are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss).\nForeign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency for each applicable foreign entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in other gains (losses) on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, except when recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) as qualifying net investment hedges.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe components of total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the balance sheets are as follows (in millions):\nNo material amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2023 or 2022.\nRevenues\nSubstantially all of our operating results represent revenues and expenses generated by property-level operations. Payments are due from customers when services are provided to them. Due to the short-term nature of our contracts and the\n91\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nalmost concurrent receipt of payment, we have no material unearned revenues at year end. We collect sales, use, occupancy and similar taxes at our hotels, which we present on a net basis (excluded from revenues) on our statements of operations. Revenues are recognized as follows:\nFair Value\nMeasurement\nIn evaluating the fair value of both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, GAAP outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data (“observable inputs”) and a reporting entity’s own assumptions about market data (“unobservable inputs”). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly transaction (an “exit price”). Assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:\nLevel 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 — Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active (markets with few transactions), inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability when observable inputs are not available.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Common Share (Unit)\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share (unit) is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (unitholders) by the weighted average number of shares of Host Inc. common stock or Host L.P. common\n92\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nunits outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share (unit) is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (unitholders), as adjusted for potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted average number of shares of Host Inc. common stock or Host L.P. common units outstanding plus other potentially dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans or the common OP units distributed to Host Inc. to support such shares granted, and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partner interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for any securities that are anti-dilutive. There are\n9.5\nmillion Host L.P. common units, which are convertible into\n9.7\nmillion Host Inc. common shares, that are not included in Host Inc.'s calculation of earnings (loss) per share as their effect is not dilutive.\nThe calculation of Host Inc. basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share is shown below (in millions, except per share amounts):\nThe calculation of Host L.P. basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common unit is shown below (in millions, except per unit amounts):\nShare-Based Payments\nUpon the issuance of Host’s common stock under the compensation plans, Host L.P. will issue to Host Inc. common OP units of an equivalent value. These liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nWe recognize costs resulting from Host Inc.’s share-based payment transactions over their vesting periods. We classify share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services either as equity-classified awards or\n93\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nliability-classified awards. Equity-classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. The plan includes awards that vest over a\none-year\n,\ntwo-year\nand\nthree-year\nperiod. For performance-based awards, compensation cost will be recognized during the requisite service period based on the performance condition that is the most likely outcome. No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility, however, this cash balance is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.\nAcquisitions and\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen acquiring an asset, we determine whether the acquisition is an asset acquisition or a business combination based on whether the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single (group of similar) identifiable assets, resulting in an asset acquisition or, if not, resulting in a business combination. If treated as an asset acquisition, the asset is recorded in accordance with our property and equipment policy and related acquisition costs are capitalized as part of the asset.\nIn a business combination, we recognize identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests at their fair values at the acquisition date based on the exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date). We evaluate several factors, including market data for similar assets, expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets and liabilities acquired. Property and equipment are recorded at fair value and such fair value is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties. Acquisition-related costs, such as due diligence, legal and accounting fees, are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets.\nOther items that we evaluate include identifiable intangible assets, lease assets and liabilities and, in a business combination, goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets typically consist of assumed contracts, including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value. Finance lease obligations that are assumed as part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are measured at fair value and are included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we record the corresponding right-of-use assets. Classification of a lease does not change if it is part of an asset acquisition or a business combination. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we may utilize a number of sources that arise in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data, including third-party appraisals and valuations. In certain situations, and usually only in connection with the acquisition of a foreign hotel, a deferred tax liability is recognized due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the acquired assets at the acquisition date. In a business combination, any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill. In very limited circumstances, we may record a bargain purchase gain if the consideration paid is less than the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.\nLeases\nWe consider an arrangement to contain a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for compensation. All leases pursuant to which we are the lessee, including operating leases, are recognized as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the present value of our fixed payment obligations. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of our lease obligations at initiation or modification. Our operating leases may require fixed payments, variable payments based on a percentage of revenue or income, or payments equal to the greater of a fixed or variable payment. Variable payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease terms include renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, and renewal options controlled by the lessor.\n94\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNotes Receivable\nAt December 31, 2023, our notes receivable consists of one outstanding loan issued in connection with a hotel sale. In conjunction with our dispositions, we may issue a loan to the purchaser to facilitate the sale. The loan is collateralized by the corresponding sold hotel and, in the event of a default of the loan, we would seek to enforce our rights against the collateral in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. The loan is recorded at amortized cost, on an individual asset basis. We recognize interest as it is earned and include accrued interest receivable in other assets on the balance sheets. We individually assess our notes receivable for credit losses quarterly and estimate any credit losses based on an analysis of several factors, primarily the value of the hotel collateral, as well as current economic conditions and historical trends.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\nThe standard requires additional information to be disclosed with regards to segments, including significant expense categories, identifying the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), and additional interim disclosures. The standard also requires that public entities with a single reportable segment disclose all of the required segment disclosures under the previous ASC 280 guidance in addition to the new disclosures required under ASU No. 2023-07. As noted in Note 16, we report on\none\nsegment, and therefore, upon adoption of the new standard, we will begin providing the required disclosures, however we are still evaluating the level of disclosure that will be required. This standard is to be applied on a retrospective basis for all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740):\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. The standard requires additional disclosures about income taxes, including specific categories in the rate reconciliation and disaggregated information on income taxes paid and income from continuing operations. The standard also eliminates the requirement to disclose an estimated range of the reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. We are still evaluating the level of disclosure that will be required. This standard is to be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.\n2.\nRevenues\nSubstantially all our operating results represent revenues and expenses generated by property-level operations. Payments are due from customers when services are provided to them. Due to the short-term nature of our contracts and the almost concurrent receipt of payment, we have no material unearned revenue at quarter end. We collect sales, use, occupancy and similar taxes from our customers, which we present on a net basis (excluded from revenues) on our statements of operations.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\n.\nWhile we do not consider the following disclosure of hotel revenues by location to consist of reportable segments, we have disaggregated hotel revenues by market location. Our revenues also are presented by country in Note 16 – Geographic and Business Segment Information.\n95\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBy Location.\nThe following table presents hotel revenues for each of the geographic locations in our consolidated hotel portfolio (in millions):\n3.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consists of the following (in millions):\nThe aggregate cost of real estate for federal income tax purposes is approximately $\n10.3\nbillion at December 31, 2023.\n96\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n4.\nInvestments in Affiliates\nWe own investments in joint ventures for which the equity method of accounting is used. The debt of our joint ventures, if any, is non-recourse to, and not guaranteed by, us, and a default of such debt does not trigger a default under any of our debt instruments. We carry our investments at historical cost which, due to debt restructurings or distributions, may result in a negative investment balance. However, a negative investment balance does not represent a funding obligation for us or for our partners. Investments in affiliates consist of the following (in millions):\n______________\n(1)\nDistributions received were funded by cash from operations unless otherwise noted.\n(2)\nDistributions received from Philadelphia Marriott Downtown JV in 2023 include $\n5\nmillion related to loan refinancing proceeds.\nAs part of our investment in the Noble JV, we have made a $\n211.5\nmillion capital commitment to Noble Hospitality Fund V, L.P., which represents a\n21.15\n% ownership interest in the fund. As of December 31, 2023, we have funded $\n33\nmillion to this fund.\n97\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n5.\nDebt\nDebt consists of the following (in millions):\n_____________\n(1)\nThere were no outstanding credit facility borrowings at December 31, 2023 or 2022. Amount shown represents deferred financing costs related to the credit facility revolver.\nSenior Notes\nGeneral.\nUnder the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all our unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all our subordinated obligations. The face amount of our senior notes at both December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n3.2\nbillion. The senior notes balances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are net of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs of approximately $\n30\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion, respectively. We pay interest on each series of our senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated in the table above.\nUnder the terms of the senior notes indenture, our ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we are in compliance with all of these covenants.\nAuthorization for Repurchase of Senior Notes.\nIn February 2023, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $\n1\nbillion of senior notes (other than in accordance with their terms) through February 2026. No repurchases occurred in 2023 under this program.\nCredit Facility.\nOn January 4, 2023, we entered into the sixth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n1.5\nbillion. The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $\n500\nmillion, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $\n1\nbillion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $\n100\nmillion for swingline borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars and a subfacility of up to $\n100\nmillion for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to add in the future $\n500\nmillion of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nThe revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of January 4, 2027, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of either a\n1-year\nextension option or\ntwo\n6-month\nextension options, each of\n98\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nwhich is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. One $\n500\nmillion term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of January 4, 2027, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of one 1-year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $\n500\nmillion term loan tranche has a maturity date of January 4, 2028, which date may not be extended.\nThe amendment also converted the underlying reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of\n10\nbasis points. We pay interest on U.S. dollar revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to SOFR (plus a credit spread adjustment of\n10\nbasis points) plus a margin ranging from\n72.5\nto\n140\nbasis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). We also pay a facility fee on the total $\n1.5\nbillion revolver commitment ranging from\n12.5\nto\n30\nbasis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. The credit facility includes a sustainability pricing adjustment that can result in a change in the interest rate applicable to borrowings. The adjustment can result in an increase or decrease of the interest rate for revolving loans of up to\n4\nbasis points and an increase or decrease of the facility fee of up to\n1\nbasis point. In the case of the term loans, the adjustment can result in an increase or decrease of the interest rate applicable of up to\n5\nbasis points. The adjustments will be determined annually on the basis of an annual audited report of Host L.P.’s performance against targets established in the credit facility for (1) the percentage of our consolidated portfolio with green building certifications and (2) the percentage of electricity used at all our consolidated properties that is generated by renewable resources. Effective June 30, 2023, we achieved a milestone in the progress towards our renewable energy goal, resulting in the applicable basis point reduction in the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility. Based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2023, we are able to borrow on the revolver at a rate of adjusted SOFR plus\n85\nbasis points less\n2\nbasis points for meeting sustainability milestones for an all-in rate of\n6.29\n% and pay a facility fee of\n19.5\nbasis points.\nInterest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to SOFR (plus a credit spread adjustment of\n10\nbasis points) plus a margin ranging from\n80\nto\n160\nbasis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating) and adjusted for sustainability pricing. Based on Host L.P.’s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2023, our applicable margin on SOFR loans under both term loans is\n95\nbasis points less\n2.5\nbasis points for meeting sustainability milestones, for an all-in rate of\n6.39\n%. We also may elect to pay interest on revolver and term loan borrowings using a base rate plus a margin that is similarly determined based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating.\nNet repayments under the credit facility were $\n683\nmillion in 2022. As of December 31, 2023, we have $\n1.5\nbillion of available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility.\nFinancial Covenants\n. The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage (as defined in our credit facility). We are permitted to borrow and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (“leverage ratio”) is not in excess of\n7.25\nx, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than\n1.75\nx and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than\n1.25\nx. These calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing costs related to the senior notes or the credit facility, and non-cash interest expense, all of which are or have been included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept, under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $\n100\nmillion are deducted from our total debt balance.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we are in compliance with all of these covenants.\nGuarantees\n.\nThe credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee Host L.P. debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees.\nOther Covenants and Events of Default\n.\nThe credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below\n6.0\nx. At any time that our leverage ratio is below\n6.0\nx, acquisitions, investments and dividends generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on the incurrence of debt\nincorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture. Our senior notes and credit facility have cross default provisions that would trigger a default under those agreements if we were to have a payment default or an acceleration prior to maturity of other debt of Host L.P. or its subsidiaries. The amount of other debt in default needs to\n99\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nexceed certain thresholds in order to trigger a cross default and the thresholds are greater for secured debt than for unsecured debt. The credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated, and the lenders’ commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts owed under the credit facility will become due and payable and the lenders’ commitments will terminate.\nMortgage Debt\nOur mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets, except for environmental liabilities, fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2023, we have mortgage debt secured by one asset, with an interest rate of\n4.67\n%, which mortgage debt matures in November 2027. The loan is amortizing, with principal and interest payable monthly. As of  December 31, 2023, we are in compliance with the covenants under our mortgage debt obligation. We made mortgage debt repayments of $\n2\nmillion in each of 2023 and 2022.\nAggregate Debt Maturities\nAggregate debt maturities, including principal amortization, are as follows (in millions):\nInterest\nThe following is a reconciliation between interest expense and cash interest paid (in millions):\n___________\n(1)\nDoes not include capitalized interest of $\n10\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(2)\nInterest expense and interest paid includes cash prepayment premiums of approximately $\n22\nmillion in 2021.\n6.\nEquity of Host Inc. and Capital of Host L.P.\nEquity of Host Inc.\nHost Inc. has authorized\n1,050\nmillion shares of common stock, with a par value of $\n0.01\nper share, of which\n703.6\nmillion and\n713.4\nmillion were outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFifty\nmillion shares of\n100\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nno\npar value preferred stock are authorized;\nnone\nof such preferred shares was outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCapital of Host L.P.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately\n99\n% of Host L.P.’s common OP units. The remaining common OP units are owned by unaffiliated limited partners. Each common OP unit may be redeemed for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock, based on the conversion ratio of\n1.021494\nshares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit. In exchange for any shares issued by Host Inc., Host L.P. will issue common OP units based on the applicable conversion ratio. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Host L.P. had\n698.3\nmillion and\n708.4\nmillion OP units outstanding, respectively, of which Host Inc. held\n688.8\nmillion and\n698.4\nmillion, respectively.\nRepurchases and Issuances of Common Stock and Common OP Units\nOn August 3, 2022, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase program from the existing $\n371\nmillion remaining under the prior Board authorization to $\n1\nbillion. In 2023, we repurchased\n11.4\nmillion shares at an average price of $\n15.93\nper share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $\n181\nmillion. In 2022, we repurchased\n1.7\nmillion shares at an average price of $\n15.93\nper share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $\n27\nmillion. As of December 31, 2023, we have $\n792\nmillion available for repurchase under the program.\nOn May 31, 2023, we entered into a distribution agreement with J. P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents pursuant to which Host Inc. may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of Host Inc. common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $\n600\nmillion. The sales will be made in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings under the SEC rules. We may sell shares of Host Inc. common stock under this program from time to time based on market conditions, although we are not under an obligation to sell any shares. The agreement also contemplates that, in addition to the offering and sale of shares to or through the sales agents, we may enter into separate forward sale agreements with each of the forward purchasers named in the agreement. There have been\nno\nshares issued in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, there was $\n600\nmillion of remaining capacity under the agreement.\nDividends/Distributions\nHost Inc. is required to distribute at least\n90\n% of its annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT. Funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends on its common stock are provided by distributions from Host L.P. The amount of any future dividends will be determined by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors.\nAs part of our response to COVID-19 and in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility, we temporarily suspended our regular quarterly common cash dividends, commencing with the second quarter 2020 dividend through year end 2021. We reinstated a quarterly common cash dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2022. The dividends that were taxable to our stockholders in 2023 are considered\n91.8\n% ordinary and\n8.2\n% unrecaptured Section 1250 gain. The dividends that were taxable to our stockholders in 2022 are considered\n78.1\n% ordinary and\n21.9\n% unrecaptured Section 1250 gain. The 2023 and 2022 ordinary dividends are eligible for the\n20\n% deduction provided by Section 199A.\nThe table below presents the amount of common dividends declared per share and common distributions per unit as follows:\nOn February 21, 2024, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.20\nper share on its common stock. The dividend will be paid on April 15, 2024 to stockholders of record as of March 28, 2024.\n101\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n7.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year beginning January 1, 1999. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least\n90\n% of our annual taxable income to our stockholders, excluding net capital gain. As a REIT, generally we will not be subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes on that portion of our annual taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for\nfour\nsubsequent taxable years. Even if we qualify to be treated as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property, and to U.S. federal and state corporate income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.\nSet forth below is a table that documents our domestic and foreign income tax attributes at December 31, 2023:\nWe have recorded a\n100\n% valuation allowance of approximately $\n8\nmillion against the deferred tax asset related to our domestic capital loss carryover, which expires following the 2023 tax year, and a valuation allowance of approximately $\n5\nmillion against the deferred tax asset related to certain of our foreign net operating loss and capital loss carryovers as of December 31, 2023. We also have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $\n5\nmillion against the deferred tax asset related to our accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) foreign exchange net losses. There has been\nno\nincrease or decrease of our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2023 from the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe primary components of our net deferred tax assets are as follows (in millions):\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income in order to realize our total deferred tax assets, net of a valuation allowance of $\n18\nmillion, of $\n222\nmillion.\n102\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOur U.S. and foreign income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows (in millions):\nIncome tax provision (benefit) for continuing operations consists of (in millions):\nThe differences between the income tax provision (benefit) calculated at the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of\n21\n% and the actual income tax provision (benefit) recorded for continuing operations are as follows (in millions):\nCash taxes activity included a net payment of $\n12\nmillion in 2023, and a net refund of $\n19\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOur unrecognized tax benefits remained unchanged at $\n1\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. All of such uncertain tax position amounts, if recognized, would impact our reconciliation between the income tax provision (benefit) calculated at the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of\n21\n% and the actual income tax provision (benefit) recorded each year.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions generally include 2020-2023. There were\nno\nmaterial interest or penalties recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n103\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n8.\nLeases\nTaxable REIT Subsidiaries Leases\nWe lease substantially all our hotels to a wholly owned subsidiary that qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary due to the U.S. federal income tax prohibition on the ability of a REIT to derive revenues directly from the operations of a hotel.\nGround Leases\nAs of December 31, 2023, all or a portion of\n19\nof our hotels are subject to ground leases, generally with multiple renewal options, all of which are accounted for as operating leases. Payments for ground leases account for approximately\n74\n% of our 2023 minimum lease payments and\n96\n% of our total future minimum lease payments. For lease agreements with scheduled rent increases, we recognize the fixed portion of the lease expense ratably over the term of the lease. As the exercise of the renewal options were determined to be reasonably certain, the payments associated with the renewals have been included in the measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset. Contingent rental payments based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset but will be recognized as variable lease expense if and when they are incurred. However, certain of these leases contain provisions that increase the minimum lease payments based on an average of the variable lease payments made over the previous years, for which we will reevaluate the lease liability and ROU asset as these payments represent an increase in the minimum payments for the remainder of the lease term. Certain of these leases also contain provisions that increase the minimum lease payments based on an index such as the Consumer Price Index. Such increases are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset but will be recognized as variable lease expense if and when they are incurred. The discount rate used to calculate the lease liability and ROU asset is based on our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), as the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable. To calculate our IBR, we obtained a forward curve using LIBOR swap rates, with terms ranging from\none\nto\nfifty years\n, as well as corresponding bond spreads based on the terms of the leases and our credit risk. The resulting discount rates for our ground leases range from\n4.3\n% to\n5.7\n%.\nOffice Leases and Other\nWe have office leases for our headquarters office in Bethesda, which expires in 2036, as well as a satellite office in Miami, which lease expires in 2025, with no renewal options.\nWe also have leases on facilities used in our former restaurant business, all of which we subsequently subleased. These leases and subleases contain\none\nor more renewal options, generally for\nfive\n- or\nten-year\nperiods. The restaurant leases are accounted for as operating leases. Our contingent liability related to these leases is $\n1.1\nmillion and $\n1.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We, however, consider the likelihood of any material funding related to these leases to be remote. Our leasing activity also includes leases entered into by our hotels for various types of equipment, which may be accounted for either as operating or\nfinance leases\n, depending upon the characteristics of the particular lease arrangement. Our finance leases total less than $\n1\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe following table presents lease cost and other information (in millions):\n104\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the total amount of lease payments, on an undiscounted basis, to the lease liability on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 (in millions):\nMinimum payments for the operating leases have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants of approximately $\n2.4\nmillion that are payable to us under non-cancelable subleases.\n9.\nEmployee Stock Plans\nUpon the issuance of Host Inc.’s common stock for stock-based compensation, Host L.P. issues to Host Inc. common OP units of an equivalent value. Accordingly, these awards and related disclosures are included in both Host Inc.’s and Host L.P.’s consolidated financial statements.\nHost Inc. maintains two stock-based compensation plans, the Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2020 Comprehensive Plan”), under which Host Inc. may award to participating employees restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. At December 31, 2023, there were approximately\nthree\nmillion shares of Host Inc.’s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the 2020 Comprehensive Plan.\nWe recognize costs resulting from share-based payments in our financial statements over their vesting periods. No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services. We classify share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity-classified or liability-classified awards. Equity-classified awards are measured based on their fair value as of the date of grant. In contrast, liability-classified awards are re-measured to fair value each reporting period.\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $\n30\nmillion, $\n26\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively. Shares granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 totaled\n1.8\nmillion,\n1.8\nmillion and\n3.0\nmillion, respectively, while\n2.3\nmillion,\n1.5\nmillion and\n1.1\nmillion shares, respectively, vested during those years.\nSenior Executive Plan\nDuring 2023, Host Inc. granted\n1.6\nmillion RSU awards under the 2020 Comprehensive Plan, which amount represents the maximum number of RSUs that can be earned during the period of 2023 through 2025 if performance is at the “high” level of achievement and, for time-based awards, the executive remains employed. The RSUs vest over a\none\n,\ntwo\nor\nthree-year\nperiod and\n2.6\nmillion RSUs were unvested at December 31, 2023. Total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSU awards that vest through 2025 is approximately $\n19\nmillion.\n105\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRSU awards\nVesting of RSUs awarded in 2023 is based on (1) continued employment on the vesting date (“Time-Based Award”); (2) the achievement of relative total shareholder return (“TSR”); and (3) our Adjusted EBITDAre performance. Approximately\n25\n% of the RSUs are Time-Based Awards and vest on an annual basis over\nthree years\n; approximately\n37.5\n% of the RSUs are based on the satisfaction of the TSR compared to the NAREIT Equity Lodging & Resort index that serves as a relevant industry/asset specific measurement to our competitors and vest following a\nthree-year\nperformance period; and the remaining\n37.5\n% are based on Adjusted EBITDAre performance and vest following a three-year performance period. The RSUs granted are considered equity-classified awards. As a result, the fair value of these awards is based on the fair value on the grant date, and such grant date fair value is not adjusted for subsequent movements thereof.\nWe value the time-based awards using the closing stock price on the grant date multiplied by the percentage of shares expected to be released, which is\n100\n% of the time based awards. We also value the Adjusted EBITDAre awards using the closing stock price on the grant date multiplied by the percentage of shares expected to be released; however, as a result of the Adjusted EBITDAre performance conditions, we reevaluate the percentage based on the probability of meeting the performance conditions each period.\nWe value the TSR awards using the economic theory that is the basis for all valuation models, including Binominal, Black-Scholes, exotic options formulas, and Monte Carlo valuations. We valued the TSR awards with the following assumptions:\nIn making these assumptions, we base the expected volatility on the historical volatility over three years using daily stock price observations. The beta is calculated by comparing the risk of our stock to the risk of the applicable peer group index, using three years of daily price data. We base the risk-free rate on the Treasury bond yields corresponding to the length of each performance period as reported by the Federal Reserve.\nThe payout schedule for the TSR awards is as follows, with linear interpolation for points between the 30\nth\nand 75\nth\npercentiles:\n106\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded compensation expense of approximately $\n27\nmillion, $\n23\nmillion and $\n16\nmillion, respectively, related to the RSU awards to senior executives.\nThe following table is a summary of the status of our senior executive plans for the three years ended December 31, 2023:\n___________\n(1)\nShares that vest at December 31 of each year are issued to the employees in the first quarter of the following year, although the requisite service period is complete. Accordingly, the\n0.7\nmillion shares issued in 2023 include shares vested at December 31, 2022, after adjusting for shares withheld to meet employee tax requirements. The shares withheld for employee tax requirements were valued at $\n11\nmillion, $\n8\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOther Stock Plans\nIn addition to the share-based plans described above, we maintain an upper-middle management plan and an employee stock purchase plan. The upper-middle management awards are time-based, equity-classified awards that vest within\nthree-years\nof the grant date and compensation expense is recognized over the life of the award based on the grant date fair value. Through the employee stock purchase plan, employees can purchase stock at a discount of\n10\n% of the lower of the beginning and ending stock price each quarter. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, we granted a total of\n0.2\nmillion shares,\n0.2\nmillion shares and\n0.3\nmillion shares, respectively, under these two programs and recorded compensation expense of approximately $\n3\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion, respectively.\n10.\nProfit Sharing and Post-employment Benefit Plans\nWe contribute to defined contribution plans for the benefit of employees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who elect participation in the plans. The discretionary amount to be matched by us is determined annually by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors. Our liability recorded for this obligation is not material. Payments for these items were not material for the three years ended December 31, 2023.\n11.\nDispositions\nWe disposed of\none\nhotel in 2023,\nfour\nhotels in 2022, and\nsix\nhotels in 2021, and recorded aggregate gains on sale of approximately $\n69\nmillion, $\n18\nmillion, and $\n305\nmillion, respectively. The gain on sale of assets is included in other gains on the statement of operations.\nIn conjunction with the sale The Camby, Autograph Collection in 2023, we provided a $\n72\nmillion loan to the buyer. The loan has an initial interest rate equal to Term SOFR plus\n425\nbasis points and an initial scheduled maturity date of June 10, 2025, which date may be extended to March 10, 2026. Up to an additional $\n12\nmillion in funding is available to the buyer under the loan for property improvement plan financing not to exceed a\n65\n% loan to cost ratio. As of December 31, 2023, none of the additional funding has been borrowed. The outstanding loan is included in Notes Receivable on our balance sheets.\nIn connection with the sales of the Sheraton Boston Hotel and Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel in 2022, we provided loans to the buyers for $\n163\nmillion and $\n250\nmillion, respectively. These loans were repaid during 2023.\n107\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12.\nAcquisitions\nOn November 1, 2022, we acquired the\n125\n-room Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole for a total purchase price of $\n315\nmillion.\nDuring 2021, we acquired the following assets:\n•\nthe\n448\n-room Hyatt Regency Austin for $\n161\nmillion;\n•\nthe\n444\n-room Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort for $\n610\nmillion;\n•\nthe Royal Ka'anapali and Ka'anapali Kai golf courses, adjacent to the Hyatt Regency Maui hotel, for $\n28\nmillion;\n•\nthe\n200\n-room Baker's Cay Resort Key Largo, Curio Collection by Hilton, for $\n200\nmillion;\n•\na\n223\n-room luxury downtown Houston hotel, subsequently rebranded as The Laura Hotel, as part of the Autograph Collection by Marriott, for $\n65\nmillion;\n•\nthe\n59\n-room Alila Ventana Big Sur for $\n150\nmillion;\n•\nthe\n173\n-room Alida, Savannah, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, for $\n103\nmillion; and\n•\nthe\n319\n-room Hotel Van Zandt for $\n246\nmillion, including $\n4\nmillion for the FF&E replacement funds; in connection with the acquisition of the Hotel Van Zandt, we assumed a $\n102\nmillion mortgage loan with a fair value of $\n105\nmillion.\n13.\nFair Value Measurements\nOther Liabilities\nFair Value of Other Financial Liabilities.\nWe did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our other financial assets or liabilities. The fair values of our notes receivable, secured debt and our credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates. Senior notes are valued based on quoted market prices.\nThe fair values of financial instruments not included in this table are estimated to be equal to their carrying amounts. The fair value of certain financial assets and financial liabilities is shown below (in millions):\n14.\nRelationship with Marriott International\nWe have entered into various agreements with Marriott, including those for the management or franchise of approximately\n62\n% of our hotels (as measured by revenues) and certain limited administrative services.\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, we paid Marriott $\n168\nmillion, $\n136\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion, respectively, of hotel management fees and approximately $\n8.1\nmillion, $\n7.7\nmillion, and $\n4.4\nmillion, respectively, of franchise fees.\n108\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n15.\nHotel Management Agreements and Operating and License Agreements\nAll of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements, with some of our hotels also being subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operations under the designated brand. Hotels managed or franchised by Marriott and Hyatt represent approximately\n62\n% and\n20\n% of our total revenues, respectively. Under these agreements, the managers generally have sole responsibility for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, processing reservations and promoting and publicizing the hotels. The managers also provide all employees for the hotels, prepare reports, budgets and projections, control the working capital, and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels. Costs and expenses incurred by the managers are reimbursed by us. We have approval rights over budgets, capital expenditures, significant leases and contractual commitments, and various other matters.\nThe initial term of our agreements generally is\n10\nto\n25\nyears, with\none\nor more renewal terms at the option of the manager. The majority of our agreements condition the manager’s right to exercise options for renewal upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria. The manager typically receives a base management fee, which is calculated as a percentage (generally\n2\n-\n3\n%) of annual gross revenues, and an incentive management fee, which typically is calculated as a percentage (generally\n10\n-\n20\n%) of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment. In the case of our hotels operating under the W\n®\n, Westin\n®\n, Sheraton\n®\n, Luxury Collection\n®\nand St. Regis\n®\nbrands, the base management fee is\n1\n% of annual gross revenues, but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to Marriott under a separate license agreement pertaining to the designated brand, including rights to use trademarks, service marks and logos, matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies, and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services. Under the license agreement, Marriott generally receives\n5\n% of gross revenues attributable to room sales and\n2\n% of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales in addition to the base management fee.\nPursuant to the agreements, the manager furnishes the hotels with certain chain services, which generally are provided on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the manager’s hotel system. Chain services include central training, advertising and promotion, national reservation systems, computerized payroll and accounting services, and such additional services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing such services are allocated among the hotels managed, owned or leased by the manager on a fair and equitable basis. In addition, our managers generally sponsor a guest rewards program, the costs of which are charged to all of the hotels that participate in such program.\nWe are obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds, generally\n4\n-\n5\n% of the revenues generated at the hotel, to cover the cost of (a) certain non-routine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which normally are capitalized, and (b) replacements and renewals to the hotels’ furniture, fixtures and equipment. Under certain circumstances, we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the agreements.\nWe generally are limited in our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee assumes the related management agreement. However, most agreements include owner rights to terminate on the basis of the manager’s failure to meet certain performance-based metrics. Typically, these criteria are subject to the manager’s ability to ‘cure’ and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts (or, in some instances, waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees).\nIn addition to any performance-based or other termination rights, we have negotiated specific termination rights related to specific agreements. These termination rights can take a number of different forms, including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement; termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation; and termination without sale or other condition, which may require the payment of a fee.\n16.\nGeographic and Business Segment Information\nWe consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment, as we allocate resources and assess operating performance based on individual hotels. All of our hotels meet the aggregation criteria for segment reporting and our other real estate investment activities (primarily our retail spaces and office buildings) are immaterial. As such, we report\none\nsegment: hotel ownership. Our foreign operations consist of hotels in\ntwo\ncountries as of December 31, 2023. There were\n109\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nno intersegment sales during the periods presented.\nThe following table presents revenues and long-lived assets for each of the geographical areas in which we operate (in millions):\n17.\nLegal Proceedings, Guarantees and Contingencies\nVarious legal proceedings arise in the ordinary course of our business regarding the operation of our hotels and company matters. To the extent not covered by insurance, these lawsuits generally fall into the following broad categories: disputes involving hotel-level contracts, employment litigation, compliance with laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, tax disputes and other general matters. Under our management agreements, our operators have broad latitude to resolve individual hotel-level claims for amounts generally less than $\n150,000\n. However, for matters exceeding such threshold, our operators may not settle claims without our consent.\nBased on our analysis of legal proceedings with which the Company and our hotel managers are currently involved or of which we are aware and the resolution of similar claims in the past, we have recorded immaterial accruals as of December 31, 2023 related to such claims. We have estimated that, in the aggregate, our losses related to these proceedings will not be material. We are not aware of any other matters with a reasonably possible unfavorable outcome for which disclosure of a loss contingency is required. No assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings.\nHurricane Loss Contingency\nWhile the majority of our hotels in Florida were affected by Hurricane Ian, which made landfall on September 28, 2022, the most significant damage sustained during the storm occurred at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa. The Hyatt Regency Coconut Point reopened to guests in November 2022, with the final phase of reconstruction, the resort's waterpark, completed in June 2023. On July 6, 2023, The Ritz-Carlton, Naples reopened the guestrooms, suites and amenities, including the new tower expansion.\nOur current estimate of the book value of the property and equipment written off and remediation costs is approximately $\n130\nmillion, for which we recorded a corresponding insurance receivable. As of December 31, 2023, we have received $\n213\nmillion of insurance proceeds related to these claims, of which $\n130\nmillion reduced our receivable to\nzero\n, and, in 2023, $\n80\nmillion was recognized as a gain on business interruption, and $\n3\nmillion was recognized as a gain on property insurance, which are both included in gain on insurance settlements on our consolidated statements of operations.\nTax Indemnification Agreements\nBecause of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of\ntwo\nhotels currently owned by Host L.P., we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels, or repaying or refinancing mortgage debt, for varying periods. One of these agreements expires in 2028 and the other in 2031.\n110"
