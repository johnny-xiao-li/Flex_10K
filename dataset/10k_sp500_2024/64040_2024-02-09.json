Among other things, this includes promoting an inclusive and performance-driven workplace culture with equitable opportunity for all; managing the Company’s initiatives to attract, develop, engage and retain the high-quality talent needed to ensure the Company is equipped with the right skillsets and intellectual capital to deliver on current and future business needs; and overseeing the design of the Company’s compensation, benefits and well-being programs. In connection with these responsibilities, the Chief Purpose Officer also partners with our Corporate Responsibility & Diversity, Equity & Inclusion team on the development and execution of the Company’s diversity, equity and inclusion roadmap and works closely with the CEO on executive succession planning and development of the talent succession pipeline for the Company’s Executive Committee.\nThe Company’s short-term incentive plan further reflects the significant role our people play in driving our enterprise strategy to Power Global Markets by linking executive pay outcomes under our enterprise and division balanced scorecards to the achievement of strategic people priorities. In 2023, we focused on delivering on the following strategic People priorities across the enterprise:\n•\nDelivered a new, biennial, enterprise experience (Accelerate Progress LIVE: Lead with Purpose) to further connect with our Company’s purpose and reflect on and celebrate the many ways purpose comes to life\n•\nEncourage career mobility and career development through career coaching and Thrive, our performance management experience\n•\nImprove diverse representation through hiring, advancement and retention, while continuing to raise awareness through DEI education\n•\nAttract and retain our people through recognition programs, learning opportunities, and fair compensation\nTo achieve our strategic people objectives, we support our employees through human capital management strategies that include diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; learning and development programs; competitive compensation and benefits programs; hybrid work, benefits and well-being programs; and talent attraction, retention and engagement. Examples of some of our key initiatives and programs in these focus areas are included below.\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\nOur ability to attract and retain a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to our long-term strategy, driving business growth and innovation and empowering our people to achieve their full potential. In connection with our commitment to create a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, we remain committed to fostering an environment where our people can bring their whole selves to work:\n•\nUnder the leadership of our Chief Purpose Officer, our enterprise DEI strategy is executed globally and addresses the local, regional and global needs of our workforce.  In partnership with the Executive Committee, regular updates are provided to align on strategy and prioritization, and to improve connectivity and create a defined and well-coordinated feedback loop between the Company’s Board of Directors, the Executive Committee, DEI team, People Resource Groups and people leaders.\n•\nWe measure progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion programs as part of our enterprise and division balanced scorecards, which are reviewed by the CEO quarterly and the Board at least biannually. These metrics are linked to short-term incentive compensation and help increase accountability for our DEI progress. Key performance indicators include measuring the net change in the gender and racial/ethnic diversity of the Company’s employee population. Additionally, we track and monitor employee sentiments on DEI through the annual VIBE employee engagement survey entitled VIBE.\n•\nWe connect colleagues across our organization through our People Resource Groups (PRGs). These global, employee-led networks offer career experiences and network-building opportunities that foster professional development and support workplace diversity. United by intersectionality and shared purpose, our nine PRGs also provide community for our people across diverse backgrounds.\n•\nTo both attract and retain our pipeline of diverse talent, we have expanded our outreach and recruiting partnerships with associations and industry groups, select Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic\n10\nTable of Contents\nServing Institutions (HSIs). We have enhanced our training globally to incorporate awareness of unconscious bias and inclusion, and expanded career mentoring and leadership development opportunities for diverse colleagues.\nLearning and Development Programs\nWe support our employees in pursuing their professional goals with growing investments in personalized development. We provide a wide array of global training and learning programs to help employees expand their knowledge, skills and experience and guide career advancement, including:\n•\nTechnology Training - We offer internal technology training programs to enhance the technology skills of our workforce and accelerate our ability to solve complex problems using a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithm development and technology education for all employees.\n•\nCareer Coaching - We offer a career coaching program, providing customized support through global career coaches, to empower people to take ownership of their career and help them navigate their career path and opportunities to grow within the Company.  This approach to empower our people in their careers aligns to our performance management philosophy and processes and is reinforced across our suite of learning programs.\n•\nLeadership Development - We invest in developing leaders at all levels of our organization through targeted programs designed to foster leadership excellence in people managers, develop emerging leaders and strengthen our executive talent bench, providing a robust internal succession pipeline for our Executive Committee. These programs use a variety of engagement types including in-person immersions, virtual cohorts, and self-guided on demand exercises.\n•\nLearning for All – We have a centralized learning team that hosts personal and professional upskilling courses, available to all our people across the enterprise and in a variety of formats.  These offerings complement the efforts of our divisional and functional learning teams that provide product, client, and role-based skills training specific to their areas.\n•\nTeam Development – Our teams are at the heart of what we do at S&P Global, so we offer support and resources to help them stay connected with one another, navigate change, and continue to produce high-quality work.  We lead a variety of workshops focused on building and maintaining effective teams.\nCompetitive Compensation Programs\nWe believe compensation and recognition programs are critical to the overall people experience. Offering market competitive, people-centric and performance-driven compensation is key to our recruitment, talent management and retention strategies. As a result, management regularly assesses employee feedback, competitor research, and market data to ensure our programs remain competitive, equitable, and are designed with our people’s financial and social well-being in mind. Based on these insights, each year we continue to introduce new and enhanced “people first” capabilities in support of our philosophy. Our compensation program consists of a mix of:\n•\nAnnual Salary where base pay is determined by role, scope, external market rate and internal parity relative to geographic location.  Recognizes level of proficiency and skill exhibited as compared to role requirements.\n•\nAnnual Bonus as a cash reward acting as our main pay-for-performance vehicle through annual programs.  Recognizes achievement against individual, team, and group performance.\n•\nEquity awards for our strategic leaders acknowledging achievements of individual and organizational goals typically in recognition of contributions that positively influence strategic growth, operational alignment, and product innovation.\nIn 2023 we continued broadened initiatives to increase pay transparency, empowering our people leaders to manage pay conversations in an effort to continue attracting and retaining top talent.\nHybrid Work, Benefits, and Well-being\nThe health, safety and well-being of our people working around the globe is a top priority, and our facilities worldwide follow rigorous, internally and externally audited, occupational health and safety policies.\nIn early 2023, most of our employees remained working from home and we introduced a new flexible return to office model via a phased approach called anchor-flex.  This model was not mandated as a full return, rather defining regular days our people might be in the office and those where they would work virtually.  Throughout, we continued to promote health, safety and the welfare of our people.\n2023 facility upgrades include: snack and fruit options offered free of charge at all our global locations with healthful choices in mind; menstruation products provided free of charge at all locations; upgrades to nursing/wellness rooms, including hospital-grade Medela pump available in each office nursing room, as well as fridge, dimmable lighting, mirror, disinfectant wipes, and\n11\nTable of Contents\nhand moisturizer; enhancements to prayer, contemplation and wellness rooms to include carpets, locks, storage (cubicles, racks, or cabinet), and updated signage to include multiple uses.\nIn November 2023, we announced an update to our global guidelines on working in the office, so people aligned to an office are expected to come in at least 2 days per week or 9 days per month starting January 2024. We provided a two months’ transition period and a host of resources to help people plan for the transition and any adjustments they would need to make including dependent care, commuting, or other arrangements.  Recognizing that there will be circumstances and obligations that make virtual work a necessity for some of our people, we continue to offer the option of all-hybrid work for certain roles. In 2024, we will introduce a flexible summer month, during which we will relax the expectation for in-office days.\nWe focus on the well-being of our people aligned to our “people first” philosophy through expansion of our benefits offerings globally:\n•\nRecharge, flexible and unlimited time off to balance work and life in order to maximize the effectiveness of both.\n•\nParental leave of 26 weeks to bond with new arrivals.\n•\n10 days of paid leave per calendar year to care for a close relative or loved one who has a serious illness or health condition.\n•\nSick leave for a minimum of 10 business days or local statutory timeframe.\n•\nFlexible paid compassion leave following the loss of a loved one, based on individual needs and circumstances.\n•\nThree months’ pay to family members following the loss of an employee. Expanded paid compassion leave to include pregnancy loss and loss of a pet.\n•\nGlobal Cancer Support secures the salary of any employee unable to work due to a diagnosis of cancer or other chronic disease or serious illness for up to one year, so they can stay focused on their treatment and recovery.\nWe offer well-being programs that enrich work-life experiences and help our people prioritize their mental, physical, financial, and social well-being. Some of our inclusive benefits include:\n•\nWell-being Program support and resources focused on physical and mental well-being including fitness classes, mental health programs, and education on topics such as Mental Health, Preventative Health, Family Issues, DEI, and Professional Skills Development.\n•\nWell-being Reimbursement of team members for well-being-related activities, providing the flexibility for team members to decide how to use their well-being reimbursement to meet their specific wellness needs.\n•\nFinancial well-being reimbursement for financial, tax, and estate planning.\n•\nEnhanced Reproductive Wellness options including:\n◦\nMaven Parental Support to help improve parental health outcomes through equitable care with holistic, clinical support and coaching for pregnant employees and their partners.\n◦\nMaven Expressed Milk Shipping to help parents transition back to work by providing for the delivery of expressed milk home to baby.\n◦\nFertility IQ/Menopause IQ: Provides premier, on-demand digital education globally to support family building (Fertility IQ) and menopause topics (Menopause IQ).\n•\nEducational Support Policy & Student Loan Reimbursement: Subject to course of study, the Company will reimburse previously-approved tuition, registration/program fees and course-related books up to the country-specific amount. The Company will match the amount an employee has been reimbursed for further education with an equal amount for a current student loan. The sum of both amounts cannot exceed the country-specific annual maximum.\nRetention and Engagement\nIn order to attract and retain the high-quality talent needed to execute our long-term strategy of Powering Global Markets, we believe it is critical for our people to feel motivated and empowered. As a result, we strive to create a unified and inclusive workplace culture that promotes employee engagement, satisfaction, and performance; and that reflects our common corporate purpose and values.\nIn December 2023, we hosted “Accelerate Progress LIVE: Lead with Purpose,” an enterprise-wide event exploring our company purpose, how our people contribute, and its impact on our customers.  This was the first of its kind event for the Company and was bookended with support for our leaders to reinforce the key messages.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe invite employee feedback through a variety of channels for open communication and engagement, including small group employee round-table discussions with our business leaders and members of our Board of Directors, our annual VIBE employee engagement survey, as well as more frequent check-ins through employee “Pulse” surveys. The annual VIBE survey allows us to track progress in critical areas, such as workplace pride and satisfaction and inclusive culture, and gather actionable insights for improvements to our people strategy. We encourage managers to share VIBE survey results with their teams, prioritize action areas and pursue solutions. To reinforce management accountability, we also track employee survey scores in our enterprise and division balanced scorecards, with outcomes against survey engagement targets impacting short-term incentive outcomes.\nAvailable Information\nS&P Global’s investor relations website provides access to Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Proxy Statements, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, earnings releases and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

    "text": "The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nWe operate in the capital, commodities, and automotive markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, petrochemicals, metals & steel and agriculture; and the automotive markets include manufacturers, suppliers, dealerships, service shops and consumers. Certain risk factors are applicable to certain of our individual segments while other risk factors are applicable Company-wide.\nCybersecurity, Technology and Innovation Risks\nOur size, scale and role in the global markets increases our risk for cyber attacks and other cyber-security risks. Our information systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information, including material non-public information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our information systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers, including our vendors. Cyber threats continue to further evolve and continue to be more difficult to detect and successfully defend against. As a result, cyber threats have in the past and may in the future defeat the measures that we or our third-party service providers take to anticipate, detect, avoid, or mitigate such threats.\n•\nOur businesses often have access to material non-public information concerning the Company’s customers, including sovereigns, public and private companies, and other third parties around the world, the unauthorized disclosure of which could affect the trading markets for such customers’ securities and could damage such customers’ competitive positions. Some of our own products and services also include material non-public information that could affect trading markets. Unauthorized disclosure of this information as a result of cyber attacks and other unauthorized occurrences on our information systems and networks could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us.\n•\nThe cyber threats we and our third-party service providers (including our vendors) face are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated and include denial of service attacks, ransomware, spyware, phishing/smishing/vishing attacks, business compromise attacks, employee errors, negligence or malfeasance, the use of malicious codes or worms, payment fraud, and other unauthorized occurrences on, or conducted through, our or our third-party service providers’ (including our vendors’) information systems and networks, originating from a wide variety of sources, including criminals, terrorists, nation states, financially motivated actors, internal actors, and external service providers. The cyber risks the Company faces range from cyber attacks common to most industries, to more sophisticated and targeted attacks, including attacks carried out by state-sponsored actors, intended to obtain\n13\nTable of Contents\nunauthorized access to certain information or information systems or networks due in part to our prominence in the global marketplace, such as our ratings on debt issued by sovereigns and corporate issuers, our impending methodology changes in our benchmarks businesses, or the composition of our indices. Our third-party service providers, including our vendors, are also the subject of a variety of cyber attacks, including attacks carried out by state-sponsored actors.\n•\nWe and our third-party service providers, including our vendors, experience cyber attacks, data breaches and other cyber threats of varying degrees on a regular basis. The volume of such attacks, breaches and threats have increased over the years and we expect that volume to continue to increase. Breaches of our or our third-party service providers’ (including our vendors’) information systems and networks may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such third-party’s websites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us, our business or our customers. Although cyber attacks and data breaches on the Company and its third-party service providers have not had a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future.\n•\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software. While such vulnerabilities have not resulted in a material adverse effect on the Company, they require us to devote time and resources to remediation on a regular basis. Notwithstanding our efforts, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a material adverse effect resulting from vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software.\n•\nMisappropriation, improper modification, destruction, corruption or unavailability of our data and information, including personal data, due to cyber incidents, attacks or other security breaches, or the perception of such an occurrence, could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, lead to loss of customer confidence in our security measures and reliability, which would harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones, result in financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us, and lead to increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such incidents. We may be required to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of any errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service and we may have insufficient recourse against our third-party service providers, including our vendors. Additionally, our failure to timely or accurately communicate cyber incidents to relevant parties, including as a result of a failure of our third-party service providers, including our vendors, to inform us of incidents impacting their information systems or networks in a timely manner could result in regulatory or litigation risk, and reputational harm.\n•\nWe devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our information systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers, clients and employees. However, such measures may be circumvented or become obsolete, and additional measures that we take to prevent or mitigate cyber incidents may be expensive or ineffective. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our security measures will be sufficient to protect our information or information systems and networks.\n•\nWhile we conduct cyber due diligence during the acquisition process, following the completion of acquisitions, we have identified weaknesses and vulnerabilities in acquired entities’ information systems and networks, which expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own information systems or networks more vulnerable to a cyber attack. Such weaknesses and vulnerabilities have been, and may continue to be identified as we complete integration of IHS Markit Ltd. information systems and networks.\n•\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe markets in which we operate continuously change to adapt to customer needs. Our inability to innovate and compete with new or enhanced products and services of our competitors could impact our profitability.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets that continuously change to adapt to customer needs. We could experience material threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate. In order to maintain a competitive position, we invest in innovation, new offerings and enhancements, including new ways to deliver our products and services. These new or enhanced offerings resulting from our investments sometimes do not, and may not in the future, achieve market acceptance, profit or the level of profitability that we expect or have experienced historically.\nOur ability to develop, adapt, or implement new and improved processes and technology may materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nThe rapid change of technology is a key feature of all of the markets in which we operate. To succeed in the future, we will need to deploy improved processes and technology to innovate, design, develop, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner.\n•\nInnovation and constant development in support of new products and enhancements to existing products calls for the implementation of new and improved processes and technologies that require related change management efforts. While we employ a certain level of internal and external resources to mitigate the risks associated with implementing process and technology improvements, new processes and technologies that are still in development tend to be subject to more risks than established processes and technologies. For instance, certain of our new processes require manual\n14\nTable of Contents\ndata entry or collection before they can be automated, which subjects them to greater risk of human error. We may also face unexpected challenges in execution that may require more management attention than expected, thus diverting management time and energy from other businesses. The foregoing and other unforeseen factors could also result in additional commitments of financial resources and business disruptions.\n•\nWe are transitioning our technology to a cloud-based infrastructure, which is complex, time consuming, and involves substantial expenditures. Our utilization of cloud services is critical to developing and providing products and services to our customers, scaling our business for future growth, accurately maintaining data and otherwise operating our business; any such implementation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. We may discover material deficiencies in our design or implementation or maintenance of the new cloud-based systems that could adversely affect our business. Disruptions to either the outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced supplier negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems, and impair our ability to provide services to our customers.\n•\nEnhancing existing products and developing new products often requires effective collaboration across various divisions, functions and business lines of the Company. Ineffective or insufficient collaboration across divisions, functions and business lines decreases our ability to expand geographically, enhance products, innovate, increase sales, leads to brand confusion and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased availability of free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn recent years, more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available, particularly through the Internet, and advances in public cloud computing and open source software is expected to continue. Moreover, generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) may be used in a way that significantly increases access to publicly available free or relatively inexpensive information. Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information can reduce demand for our products and services. Demand could also be reduced as a result of cost-cutting initiatives at certain companies and organizations. Although we believe our products are enhanced by our analysis, tools, delivery mechanisms and applications, if a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers choose to use public sources as a substitute for our products or services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur approach to AI may not be successful, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAI is an emerging technology that is expected to fundamentally change the way data is gathered, produced, protected, licensed, processed, and consumed. Given the importance of data to our products and services, AI is becoming an increasingly important part of our business and industry.  We have established a Company-wide AI strategy to drive our approach to data protection, licensing and AI integration in our processes, products and services.  We have made significant investments in various AI initiatives. However, the AI landscape is complex and rapidly evolving, and new and enhanced laws and regulations, governmental or regulatory scrutiny, competition from established or emerging companies, litigation, ethical concerns, cybersecurity concerns, intellectual property concerns, or other complications could adversely impact our ability to protect our data and intellectual property, to develop and offer products and services that effectively use AI, to compete with other AI products or services, or to improve efficiency of existing products or services through the effective use of AI to remain competitive, or could increase our burden and cost of research, development and regulatory compliance.  For instance, competitors may deploy AI in ways that make processing of information relatively inexpensive or free, which could significantly reduce demand for our data.  Additionally, we may be unable to effectively license or otherwise protect our data from unintended use by AI.  For additional risks related to intellectual property rights, see the risk factor entitled “\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position\n.”  The development, testing and deployment of AI systems requires continued investment and may materially increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing cost involved in such systems. In addition, the number of approaches to integrating and commercializing AI is currently large, and many of those approaches may fail to gain market acceptance or become obsolete as AI continues to evolve. At this time, we are unable to predict which offerings will ultimately be successful.  Notwithstanding our investments, our products and services may become less marketable or less competitive, or potentially obsolete if either our approach to integrating AI into our products and services fails to gain market acceptance or our approach to protecting our data and intellectual property is ultimately inadequate.  Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSocial and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our offerings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of our offerings use new and evolving technologies, such as AI.  These new and evolving technologies often present social and ethical risks and challenges that could affect their adoption, and therefore our business.  For example, the use of AI could lead to harmful consequences such as accuracy issues, unintended biases or discriminatory outputs.  If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society or if we fail to properly remediate any social or ethical issues that may arise in our offerings, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, legal liability\n15\nTable of Contents\nor loss of public confidence, or our products and services may become less marketable or less competitive.  For our AI products and services to be competitive in the evolving and continually developing AI landscape, we must apply resources and make investments to secure such competitiveness and to ensure that our AI products and services are developed and implemented in a way to minimize unintended and harmful impacts. In addition, our failure to continue development and adoption of ethical and transparent policies and procedures related to AI could negatively impact our reputation and customer confidence.  Any of these social or ethical issues could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur use of open source software could result in litigation or impose unanticipated restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services.\nWe use open source software in our technology, most often as small components within a larger product or service. Open source code is also contained in some third-party software we rely on. The terms of many open source licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by United States (“U.S.”) or other courts. These licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services, licenses the software on unfavorable terms, or requires us to re-engineer our products and services or take other remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of licenses, which could be costly for us to defend.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position.\n•\nWe consider many of our products and services to be proprietary. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm the value of and revenue generated by such assets as well as our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. Businesses we acquire may also have intellectual property portfolios which increase the complexity of managing our intellectual property portfolio and protecting our competitive position.\n•\nOur products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of digital and other media. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights against infringement and misappropriation. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. For example, the legal landscape with respect to AI is rapidly evolving, and we do not yet know whether intellectual property laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate will enable us to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from unintended use by AI.  Additionally, we do business in a number of countries included on the Priority Watch List maintained by the Office of the United States Trade Representative which are currently thought to afford less protection to intellectual property rights generally than some other jurisdictions. The lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in jurisdictions in which we operate increases our vulnerability regarding unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermines our competitive position.  In addition, even in jurisdictions where there are strong protections for intellectual property rights, our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be impacted by the number of competitors attempting to infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property.\n•\nOur products also contain intellectual property of third-party sources. Any claims by third parties that we violated their intellectual property rights could result in termination of the relevant source agreement, litigation or reputational damage, or may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or to stop selling or redesign affected products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on network systems and the Internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.\n•\nOur products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks. Our customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the Internet.\n•\nOur ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party Internet providers or increased government regulation. Delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers.\n•\nIn addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers. Although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. As such, these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure such data and information.\nOur operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n16\nTable of Contents\n•\nOur ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including New York City, the location of our headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which we have offices.\n•\nThis may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful.\n•\nWe rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems, applications and services (e.g. Amazon Web Services (“AWS”)) to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.\n•\nThe physical or technological infrastructure used by us or our third-party service providers can become obsolete or restrictive, unavailable, incompatible with future versions of our products, fail to be comprehensive or accurate, or fail to operate effectively, and our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace it.\n•\nWe also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer.\n•\nWe cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nExposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries (including market studies) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nIn the normal course of business, both in the U.S. and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries (including market studies), as discussed under Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 13 –\nCommitments and Contingencies\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8,\nConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries (including market studies) will arise in the future.\n•\nMany of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries (including market studies) regularly relate to the activity of our Ratings, Indices, and Commodity Insights businesses. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to our regulated activities, antitrust matters, and other matters, such as environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters. From time to time, we also face proceedings, investigations or inquiries related to tax matters. Enhancements to our products and services combined with evolving regulation requires us to continuously evaluate our regulatory and compliance obligations, and government and self-regulatory agencies may conduct investigations to determine whether our products and services subject us to additional regulations.  Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries (including market studies) impose additional expenses on the Company, require the attention of senior management, and could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties, activity restrictions, reduced demand for our products and services, or negative impacts on our cash flows, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nIn view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation, government and regulatory enforcement matters, and changing political sentiments, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nAs litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n•\nRisks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the U.S. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against the Company in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. These\n17\nTable of Contents\nlitigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nWe may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the global privacy, data localization and data protection legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, and publish data and may impact our financial results.\n•\nWe, and certain types of information we collect, compile, use, and publish, are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients and employees in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Further, global privacy, data localization, data maintenance, data transfer and data protection legislation, regulatory, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly and continually evolving and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. There is also increasing concern among certain privacy and data protection advocates, government regulators, litigators, and the press regarding marketing and privacy matters as well as data protection, particularly as they relate to individual privacy, threats to personal information, and perceived national security interests. Costs and adaptation of our business practices to comply with and implement the increasing privacy-related and data protection, data maintenance and transfer restriction measures have been, and we expect will continue to be, significant, particularly as the laws and regulations across jurisdictions change frequently and sometimes conflict. In addition, such measures, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, increase our operating costs and require significant management time and attention, and may result in negative publicity and subject us to costs that may harm our business, including fines or damages as well as demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\n•\nThere has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer, accompanied by examinations of regulated entities, and legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature and interpretations by courts around the world of privacy and data protection laws around the world, including in jurisdictions such as the U.S. (including in an increasing number of U.S. states), the European Union (the “EU”), the People’s Republic of China and India, could have a significant impact on our processing of personal and sensitive information of our employees, vendors and customers and other data, and in turn, our business practices.\n•\nFailure to comply with privacy and data protection requirements could result in significant penalties. The EU’s comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (“GDPR”), for example, is a comprehensive regulation applying across all EU member states, providing for penalties of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, and the average GDPR penalties increased in 2023 compared to prior years.\n•\nWe devote meaningful time and financial resources to compliance with current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity, data protection and related laws and regulations. We have made, and expect to continue to make, capital investments and other expenditures to address cybersecurity preparedness and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. Any such expenses that we incur in the future, which could be material, will impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred, but may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to compromise our information or information technology systems.\n•\nContinued privacy and data protection concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations. Future laws and regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use, and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations, increased compliance or litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. It is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs or require changes in our processes, technologies, and data management.\n•\nWe are also from time to time subject to, or face assertions that we are subject to, additional obligations relating to personal and other data by contract or due to assertions that self-regulatory obligations or industry standards apply to our practices.\nFuture legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes, especially abrupt changes, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFuture legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes, such as financial services regulatory reform, energy or commodity-specific regulation, including oil, regulations related to pricing providers, sustainability, credit rating data, data privacy, operational resilience and cyber security, tax regulations, AI, ESG, government-sponsored enterprise reform and increased infrastructure spending and significant changes in trade policy (including sanctions), could impact our business. There are currently a number of laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate around the world that have recently been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered to which we or our clients will or may become subject, but at this time their impact on our business and results of operations remains uncertain. Changes in legislation, regulation or policy increase the likelihood that we will fail to appropriately adapt to changes in our compliance obligations,\n18\nTable of Contents\nparticularly when such changes happen abruptly, such as following a change in government. Any of the foregoing changes could increase our litigation and regulatory exposure, directly impact our results of operations and cash flows, adversely affect our ability to provide our products and services, or adversely impact the demand for our products and services. Such changes may also impact our business by creating increased volatility and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate. At this time, we cannot predict the scope or nature of these changes or assess what the overall effect of such potential changes could be on our results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreasing regulation of our Ratings business in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The businesses conducted by Ratings are regulated under the laws of various jurisdictions around the world, including the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the EU’s credit rating agency regulation, and the U.K.’s credit rating agency regulation.\n•\nThe U.S. Congress, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (\"IOSCO\"), the SEC, the European Commission, including through the European Securities Market Authority and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), as well as regulators in other countries in which Ratings operates, have reviewed the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies, and they may conduct such reviews in the future. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are from time to time considered by local, national and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including, for example,  provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings or to increase competition among credit rating agencies, provisions regarding remuneration and rotation of credit rating agencies, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. Other laws, regulations and rules are being considered or are likely to be considered in the future that may impact ancillary and other services provided by Ratings in addition to its credit rating products and services, for example regulatory oversight regimes for ESG ratings providers such as the proposal for an EU regulation on the transparency and integrity of ESG rating activities.\n•\nThese laws and regulations, and any other similar future rule-making, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and/or significant increased costs, which we may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. We may be required to incur significant expenses and/or take actions inconsistent with our business objectives in order to comply with such laws and regulations and to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be increased uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers’ businesses, and they may affect Ratings’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which Ratings’ ratings are developed, affect the manner in which Ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for our ratings or our other products and services and alter the economics of the credit ratings business. Each of these developments could materially increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of our credit ratings or our other products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for our credit ratings or our other products and services, and the manner in which our credit ratings are utilized.\n•\nAdditional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Indices and Commodity Insights businesses are subject to a global evolving regulatory landscape, which has and may continue to cause increased operating obligations, exposure, compliance risk and costs of doing business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nIn addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services and commodities industries.\n•\nCommodity Insights has aligned its operations with the Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies (\"PRA Principles\") issued by IOSCO and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks. Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime, control framework and operations with the Principles for Financial Benchmarks (\"Financial Benchmark Principles\") issued by IOSCO and engages an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of its adherence to the Financial Benchmark Principles.\n•\nCommodity Insights and Indices are subject to financial and commodity benchmark regulation in the EU (the “EU Benchmark Regulation”) and the U.K. (the “U.K. Benchmark Regulation”) as well as increasing benchmark regulation in other jurisdictions. Indices and Commodity Insights are both supervised by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets for the EU Benchmark Regulation. Indices is also supervised by the FCA for the U.K. Benchmark Regulation. Indices is also subject to the benchmark regulation in Australia under which it is required to and has obtained a license\n19\nTable of Contents\nfrom and is subject to the supervision of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission regarding its administration of the S&P ASX 200 index.\n•\nThe EU's package of legislative measures called the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (collectively \"MiFID II\") have applied in all EU Member States since 2018. MiFID II and potential subsequent amendments may result in changes to the manner in which Indices and Commodity Insights license their indices and price assessments, respectively, and could also have an indirect impact on the credit ratings and third-party research products offered by other divisions of the Company for use within the EU. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation may impose additional regulatory burdens on the activities of Indices and Commodity Insights in the EU over time, but their impact on, and costs to, the Company have not yet been substantive.\n•\nThe European Commission has adopted or proposed various options for regulatory intervention to address high energy prices including, among others, price limiting mechanisms on exchange traded gas products, the introduction of circuit breakers and the development of LNG import benchmarks.\n•\nThese laws, regulations and principles have impacted our Commodity Insights’ and Indices’ businesses by increasing their operating obligations, exposure, compliance risk, and costs of doing business.  Such impacts may continue or get worse as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur international business activities must comport with international trade restraints, including economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, which could affect our ability to market and/or sell our products and services into certain countries where we do business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines and penalties and related material adverse effects on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nAs a global company, we are subject to international trade restraints, including economic and financial sanction laws and embargoes. These laws include prohibitions or restrictions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons and entities.\n•\nEmbargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. These embargoes and sanctions laws have affected, and may in the future affect, our ability to continue to market and/or sell our products and services into these geographies and in turn adversely impact our revenue from such geographies. For example, in response to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, governments in the U.S., the EU, the U.K., Canada and others imposed financial and economic sanctions on certain industry segments and various parties in Russia and Belarus. We announced our suspension of commercial operations in Russia and Belarus in March 2022, which impacted revenue, particularly in Commodity Insights.\n•\nAdditional international trade restraints may be promulgated at any time and may require changes to our operations and increase our risk of noncompliance.\n•\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines and penalties and related material adverse effects on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company has previously settled and paid fines in connection with such matters.\nWe may become subject to liability or face reputational harm based on the use of our products by our clients.\n•\nSome of our products support the investment processes and other activities of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage or own trillions of dollars of assets. The use of our products as part of such activities, including the investment process, from time to time exposes us to claims for significant dollar amounts by our clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients.  Such claims have not materially adversely affected us to date, but there can be no assurance that future claims will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nThe products we develop or license, and the proprietary methodologies, models and processes on which these products rely, from time to time contain undetected errors or defects, despite testing and/or other quality assurance practices. Moreover, many of our products use new and evolving technologies, such as AI, that may contain their own undetected errors or defects. For example, the AI used in our products could include undetected errors or defects that lead to harmful consequences such as accuracy issues, unintended biases or discriminatory outputs. Errors or defects may exist during any part of a product’s life cycle and may persist notwithstanding testing and/or other quality assurance practices. Ineffective or insufficient collaboration within the Company increases the risk that such errors or defects may not be detected. Deploying products containing such errors or defects may damage our reputation, and the costs associated with remediating such errors or defects may have an impact on our profitability.\n•\nAny claim relating to our products, even one in which the outcome is ultimately favorable to us, involves a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n20\nTable of Contents\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nChanges in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, high interest rates, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nOur business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the U.S. and world commodity and financial markets.\n•\nEconomic conditions and volatility across the globe are generally affected by negative or uncertain economic and political conditions. In addition, natural and man-made disasters, public health crises (e.g., pandemics), and military conflict, such as the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, introduce volatility and uncertainty into the global capital and commodities markets and negatively impact general economic conditions. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets typically undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, increased volatility or an economic slowdown in any of those markets typically adversely affects our results of operations.  For example, military conflicts typically result in adverse and uncertain economic conditions such as negatively impacting global demand for goods and services; causing supply chain disruptions; increasing costs for transportation, energy and other raw materials; and causing an increase in cyber security incidents. Such conditions typically result in increased volatility and disruption to the global economy and the markets in which we operate, thereby adversely impacting our results of operations.\n•\nSince a significant component of our credit-rating and issuance based revenue is transaction-based, and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of rated debt securities issued in the capital markets, unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for rated debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue rated debt securities reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which Ratings provides credit ratings.\n•\nUnfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt or equity securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities negatively impact the revenue of certain business lines within Market Intelligence that are linked to debt and equity issuances.\n•\nOur Indices business is impacted by market volatility, asset levels or notional values of investment products based on our indices, and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives. Volatile capital markets, as well as changing investment styles, among other factors, may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product.\n•\nHigh or increasing interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered, which impact our Ratings segment and portions of our Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights and Indices segments, and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nOur Commodity Insights business is impacted by volatility in the commodities markets. Such volatility in our key markets could cause reduced demand for our products, impacting our revenues and margins. Changes in commodity price references, whether price assessments, benchmarks or the related trading activity in physical commodities and commodities derivatives, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n•\nHigh or increasing interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, and other market and economic factors may impact the supply and demand for new and used vehicles, which impacts our Mobility business.\n•\nDisruptions in the automotive supply chain impact production in the automotive industry and typically impact our Mobility business.\n•\nAny weakness in the macroeconomic environment, including due to recession, inflation, high or increasing interest rates and other factors, could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products.\n•\nThe foregoing factors generally affect our performance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInability to attract and retain key qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe development, maintenance, sale and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and ability of our highly skilled, educated and trained employees. Accordingly, our business is dependent on successfully attracting, retaining and training talented employees in a highly competitive business environment. Our ability to attract and retain talented employees is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. While we offer competitive salary and benefit packages, intense competition for talent within our markets is driving difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled employees. If we are less\n21\nTable of Contents\nsuccessful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to attract or retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services or achieve strategic goals may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our Company. For example, we acquired ChartIQ on January 3, 2023, TruSight Solutions LLC on January 4, 2023, and Market Scan Information Systems, Inc. on February 16, 2023. Additionally, on May 2, 2023, we sold our Engineering Solutions business. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks, as the market for acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions.\n•\nIf we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n•\nIf such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. Our acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions face difficulties, including, but not limited to, the following:\n◦\nthe process of integration being more expensive or requiring more resources than anticipated;\n◦\nan acquisition changing the composition of our markets and product mix, and difficulty gaining the skills necessary for such markets or products;\n◦\ndelays or difficulties consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including issues in integrating financial reporting, information technology infrastructure, data and content management systems and product platforms, communications and other systems;\n◦\ndelays or difficulties harmonizing corporate cultures, operating practices, management philosophies, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, compliance programs and other policies, procedures and processes;\n◦\nassuming unintended liabilities;\n◦\nunexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, including regulatory challenges that impact our ability to conduct due diligence;\n◦\nfailure to maintain employee morale or retain key personnel of the current or acquired business;\n◦\nfailure to retain existing business and operational relationships;\n◦\ncontinuing operational or financial obligations that arise under transition services agreements requiring significant management and operational resources that limit our ability to fully implement cost reduction and efficiency initiatives or other aspects of our transition plans, or divert the management’s focus from other business operations;\n◦\ndifficulty coordinating geographically separate organizations, including consolidating offices;\n◦\nthe impact of divestitures on our revenue growth being larger than projected due to greater dis-synergies or adverse effects on our overall product offerings than expected;\n◦\ndivestitures requiring continued financial involvement in the divested business through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations;\n◦\nincurring impairment charges or other losses related to divestitures; and\n◦\ndiversion of management’s focus from other business operations.\n•\nThe failure of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive, and our inability to successfully compete could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nThe markets for credit ratings, financial research, market data and solutions, index-based products, automotive data, commodities analytics and price assessments, ESG products and scores, and related news and information about these markets are intensely competitive. Our businesses compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of their offerings, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.\n•\nWhile our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers (including exchanges), we also face competition from non-traditional providers, many of whom are our clients, such as asset managers, investment banks, private equity and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses.\n•\nThe competitive landscape may also experience consolidation in the form of mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic partnerships, which results in competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies.\n22\nTable of Contents\n•\nIn addition, in some of the countries in which our businesses operate, governments have, and may in the future, provide financial or other support to locally-based competitors (particularly credit rating agencies) and have, and may from time to time in the future, establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria, benchmarks or benchmark providers, or procedures for evaluating local issuers.\n•\nChanges in the markets in which we compete may drive us to lower the fees we charge for our products and services in order to remain competitive.  In addition, if we are not able to successfully compete with our competitors, we may be required to significantly reduce the costs for our products or services, or we may lose significant market share, revenue or customers, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, certain of our fees are based on the performance of our customers, and such fees are negatively impacted when our customers’ performance is down, including due to changes in their markets.\nA significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\n•\nOur major expenditures include employee compensation and capital investments.\n•\nWe offer competitive salary and benefit packages to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including but not limited to changes in the cost of health insurance, post-retirement benefits, inflation, trends specific to the skill sets required for our workforce, and the amount of competition for qualified employees within our markets.\n•\nWe make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues.\n•\nWe rely on data provided by third-party data suppliers for a variety of our products and we rely significantly on AWS to provide, develop and maintain our cloud infrastructure. We are facing increasing costs from our third-party service providers due to a number of reasons, including inflationary pressures and costs associated with the increasing complexity of the data we require.\n•\nAlthough we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability or effectiveness of these investments.\n•\nA significant increase in any of the operating costs and expenses mentioned above could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nConsolidation of customers, reduced staffing levels of customers or reduced spending by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nOur businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the corporate, financial services, commodities and automotive industries. The consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.\n•\nOur customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. If a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n•\nAlternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial, commodity market and automotive products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, including by selecting other vendors with lower-cost offerings, or by self-sourcing their need for financial, commodity market and automotive products and services. If a significant portion of our customer base elects to consolidate their spending on financial, commodity market and automotive products and services with other vendors and not us or self-source their product and service needs, or if we lose a large portion of our business to lower priced competitors, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n•\nA material portion of our revenues in our Indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers, who have significant assets under management in index-based funds (including exchange-traded funds) and other index-based investment products. A loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire.\n•\nOur ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. Some of our products and their related value are dependent upon updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon continuing access to historical and current data.\n•\nMany of our suppliers are also our competitors, and they could change the terms of the data and products that they supply to us in order to gain competitive advantage against us, which could materially harm our business.\n•\nWe utilize certain information and data provided by third-party sources in a variety of ways, including information gathered by market participants and large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world.\n23\nTable of Contents\n•\nFrom time to time, the data from our suppliers has errors, is delayed, has design defects, is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all.  While such issues have not materially adversely affected us to date, the future occurrence of any such issue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nThe consolidation of our suppliers could result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce, which can impact the size of our supplier base, or an increase in fees charged by our suppliers, which can increase our operating costs.\n•\nSome of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice. Termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a significant data provider’s information could result in a substantial decrease of the available information for us to use (and offer our clients) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOutsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in material financial loss, increased costs, regulatory actions and penalties, reputational harm, unauthorized access to our systems, system or network disruption and improper disclosure of confidential information.\n•\nWe have outsourced certain functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies, and such functions may be further outsourced. From time to time, our third-party service providers do not perform to our standards, produce reliable results, perform in a timely manner, or perform at all. We also face the risk that our third-party service providers may fail to comply with legal requirements or maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm.\n•\nOutsourcing these functions also involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data. Failure of these third parties to maintain these safeguards could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs.\n•\nAWS provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a “cloud” computing service. Currently, we run a significant amount of our computing on AWS. Given this, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n•\nWe rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with whom we do business and to whom we outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality, including our AWS “cloud” computing services. Our service providers could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyber attacks, adverse changes to financial condition, bankruptcy or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. Thus, our plans to increase the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to “the cloud” or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure.\nOur inability to successfully recover should we or our third-party service providers experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.\n•\nShould we or our third-party service providers experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, civil unrest, protests, military conflict, terrorist attack, public health crisis (e.g., pandemic), security breach, cyber attack, data breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our or our third-party service provider’s personnel, our or our third-party service provider’s office facilities and the proper functioning of our or our third-party service provider’s computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. Global climate change is resulting, and is projected to continue to result, in certain natural disasters and adverse weather, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea‐level rise, flooding, heat waves, and cold waves, occurring more frequently or with greater intensity. In the event of any such disaster or other business continuity problem, we could experience operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel, or we could be exposed to the operational challenges of our third-party service providers, over which we have no control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n•\nWe regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOur reputation, credibility, and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our Company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n•\nOur reputation, credibility, and the strength of our brand are key competitive strengths.\n•\nGiven our role in the financial, commodities and automotive markets, our ability to attract and retain customers is uniquely affected by external perceptions of our reputation, credibility, and brand.\n•\nWe provide credit ratings, pricing and valuation services, benchmark products, ESG scores and indices, many of which depend on contributions or inputs from third parties or market participants. Our customers and other market participants expect us to be able to demonstrate that our products and services are produced independently and are not readily subject to manipulation. We believe our products and services are designed with appropriate methodologies, processes, and procedures to maintain independence and integrity; however, we may not be able to prevent third parties or market participants from working together or colluding to try to manipulate their inputs and thus the resulting outputs of our products and services. From time to time, we are involved in third-party investigations or litigation related to the markets and stakeholders our products and services serve. Any failures, negative publicity, investigations, or lawsuits that implicate the independence and integrity of our credit ratings, pricing and valuation services, benchmarks, and indices could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these products and services and could harm our reputation and our business.\n•\nNegative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with customers, prospects, regulators, and the public generally, which in turn could negatively impact, among other things, our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and suppliers, as well as suitable candidates for acquisitions or other combinations.  For example, we may face negative perceptions or publicity with respect to our sustainability and corporate responsibility policies and practices or our ESG products, methodologies, or scores, including as a result of a failure to meet publicly disclosed ESG and climate-related targets or goals, or as a result of misalignment with evolving market standards, ESG regulations and codes of conduct or regulatory expectations.  In addition, we may face similar negative perceptions or publicity as a result of “anti-ESG” sentiment among certain stakeholders, including governmental authorities, regulators, shareholders and customers.\n•\nOur divisions are all actively engaged in analyzing and providing views on economic conditions, including assessing the impact of events that create volatility and economic uncertainty, such as the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas and tensions across the Taiwan Strait. Notwithstanding the care we take in carrying out our work, the views and assumptions we express, the conclusions we draw, the actions we take (including, but not limited to, rating actions, revising the composition of our indices, etc.), and the work our divisions produce are likely to be heavily scrutinized with the benefit of hindsight. We have faced significant regulatory and media scrutiny following prior periods of volatility and economic uncertainty. Such scrutiny has in the past and may in the future impact our reputation, brand and credibility and result in government and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries and litigation.\n•\nGiven our businesses are often privy to material non-public information concerning our customers, our data could be improperly used, including for insider trading by our employees and third-party vendors with access to key systems. We have experienced insider trading incidents involving employees in the past, and it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third-party vendors. We take precautions to detect and prevent such activity, including training on insider trading policies for our employees, contractual obligations for our third-party vendors, and policies that require access restrictions for material non-public information, but such precautions are not guaranteed to deter misconduct. Any breach of our clients’ confidences as a result of employee or third-party vendor misconduct could harm our reputation.\n•\nDamage to our reputation, credibility, and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPublic health crises may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by a public health crisis, especially of an infectious disease like COVID-19. The steps governments take to prevent or contain such an event (such as travel restrictions, social distancing, quarantines, shelter in place orders or business shutdowns) may negatively impact our operations, or the operations of our suppliers or customers, or may limit our ability to interact with customers and effectively maintain and grow our operations, including through securing new subscriptions and renewals.  Public health crises may introduce volatility and uncertainty into the global financial and commodities markets and adverse general economic conditions. Risks posed to our businesses, financial condition and results of operations from volatility in the financial and commodities markets that could result from such an event are described in the risk factor above entitled “\nChanges in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, high interest rates, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business, financial condition or results of operations\n.”  Actions taken by governments to stabilize the markets and support economic growth may not be sufficient to address the market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity. The negative impact of a public health crisis on our clients could result in our products and services facing pricing pressure or delayed renewals, and challenges to new sales, which would in turn reduce revenue, ultimately impacting our results of operations. Moreover, if a public health crisis caused prolonged recessions in the U.S. and other major markets, our businesses would be materially and adversely\n25\nTable of Contents\naffected. Due to the uncertain nature of public health crises, we cannot predict the extent to which any such event would impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate change and the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy pose operational, commercial and regulatory risks.\nThe physical commodity and commodity derivative markets may be impacted by decisions by market participants and policy makers to address climate change. In addition, the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy involves changes to consumer and institutional preferences around energy consumption, and the possible failure of our products or services to facilitate the needs of customers during the transition to renewable energy could adversely impact our business and revenues. Changing preferences, including as a result of shifting market or political sentiment, could also have an adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of our customers, which could result in reduced revenues from those customers. We are also subject to risks relating to new or heightened climate change-related regulations or legislation, which could impact us and our customers and result in increased regulatory, compliance or operational costs. We are also subject to reputational risks relating to the perception of whether or not we are facilitating a migration away from fossil fuels. The risks associated with climate change and the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy are continuing to evolve rapidly, and we expect that climate change-related risks may increase over time.\nOur expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our business into major geographic and product markets (including sustainability, private markets and the People’s Republic of China), and we are in the process of such expansion efforts. Expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management. There can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nThe geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. These include, among others, risks relating to:\n◦\neconomic and political conditions around the world,\n◦\ninflation,\n◦\nhigh interest rates or fluctuation in interest rates, currency exchange rates or commodities markets,\n◦\nlimitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries,\n◦\ndiffering accounting principles and standards,\n◦\nincreases in taxes or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws (for example, the Pillar Two international tax framework established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which includes a global minimum tax of 15%),\n◦\npotential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law,\n◦\nchanges in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, including data localization requirements,\n◦\nthe possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls, withdrawal of licenses to operate, and other restrictive governmental actions,\n◦\ncompetition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions, and\n◦\ncivil unrest, protests, terrorism, unstable governments, geopolitical uncertainties and legal systems, and other factors.\nAdverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nAdditionally, we are subject to complex U.S., European and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, anti-money laundering laws, and other financial crimes laws. Our internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs related to these topics are not always effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Violations of such laws could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nCompliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and\n26\nTable of Contents\npenalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, or restrictions on business conduct that have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur indebtedness, or a downgrade to our credit ratings, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n•\nOur indebtedness could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our indebtedness obligations and our other ongoing business obligations, which may result in defaults; events of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt instruments, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, and the overall economy; placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; and increasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\n•\nOur ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our indebtedness obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, for many reasons, including to fund acquisitions. If we add additional indebtedness or other liabilities, the related risks that we face could intensify.\n27\nTable of Contents"

As a critical component of the Company’s risk management process, management has adopted an integrated risk management framework to continuously identify, assess, measure, manage, monitor and report current and emerging non-financial risks. As part of this framework, the Company has an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Committee which is chaired by the Company’s Chief Risk & Compliance Officer. Our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) is also a member of the ERM Committee.\nThe ERM Committee oversees the Company’s risk management framework, including the implementation of the framework components across the Company and promotes a strong Company-wide culture of risk management, compliance and control.\nEngagement of Third-party Support\nWe engage third-party services to conduct evaluations of our security controls, whether through penetration testing, independent audits or consulting on best practices to address new challenges. These evaluations include testing both the design and operational effectiveness of security controls. We also share and receive threat intelligence with our defense industrial base peers, government agencies, information sharing and analysis centers and cybersecurity associations.\nThird-party Risk Management\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers.\nImpact of Risks from Cybersecurity Threats\nWe are regularly subject to cybersecurity attacks.  None of the risks from cybersecurity threats we’ve faced to date have materially affected, and we do not believe are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\nGovernance.\nBoard Oversight of Cybersecurity Threats\nThe board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) has oversight responsibility for the Company’s risk management framework, including technology and cybersecurity risks facing the Company.\nOur Board, and Nominating and Audit Committees, gave significant consideration over the past several years to the appropriate Board and Committee oversight structure for risks associated with technology and cybersecurity. The full Board receives briefings from management on enterprise-wide technology, cybersecurity risk management and the overall technology and cybersecurity environment by management. Specifically, the full Board receives biannual reports from the Chief Digital Solutions Officer and the CISO.\nThe Board coordinates with the Audit Committee and Finance Committee to ensure active Board- and Committee-level oversight of the Company’s technology and cyber risk profile, enterprise technology and cyber strategies, and information security initiatives. In addition, the Board has delegated primary responsibility for oversight of the Company’s key risks, including cybersecurity, to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews technology and cybersecurity risks, as well as\n28\nTable of Contents\nthe Company’s risk mitigation processes and internal control procedures to protect sensitive business information. The Audit Committee also receives regular updates from the Chief Digital Solutions Officer and the CISO on the Company’s technology and cybersecurity programs. In addition, the Finance Committee oversees management’s strategy with regard to technology and associated risks, including cybersecurity risks, when considering major capital expenditures and acquisitions. The Board also receives regular updates from the Audit Committee and Finance Committee on their in-depth Committee-level reviews.\nRole of Management\nIn addition to the risk management activities undertaken by the ERM Committee, our corporate information security organization, led by our CISO, is responsible for our overall information security strategy, policy, security engineering, operations and cyber threat detection and response. The current CISO has more than 26 years of technology industry leadership, cybersecurity expertise and engineering and operations experience. The corporate information security organization manages and continually enhances the Company’s enterprise security structure with the goal of preventing cybersecurity incidents to the extent feasible, while simultaneously increasing our system resilience to minimize the business impact should an incident occur. Central to this organization is our cyber incident response team, which is responsible for the Company’s protection, detection and response capabilities.\nIn the event of a cybersecurity incident, the Company is equipped with an incident response plan that includes: (i) detection and analysis, (ii) containment and eradication, and (iii) remediation and (iv) preparation for future incidents. Incident responses are led by our Information Security team and supported by Legal, Compliance and other functions as appropriate. The CISO and the Chief Digital Solutions Officer provide regular updates to the Board and the Audit Committee concerning the Company’s technology and cybersecurity programs, associated risks and the Company’s efforts to help mitigate those risks."

These increases were partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023, a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue at Ratings and lower over-the-counter derivatives revenue at Indices.

Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary, partially offset by a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue. Asset linked fees remained relatively unchanged at Indices due to higher average levels of assets under management for ETFs, offset by product mix. The increase in sales-usage based royalties was primarily driven by higher exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices and an increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data and price assessments to commodity exchanges at Commodity Insights. Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence increased due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit and fixed income new issuance volumes.

Segment operating profit is not, however, a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.\nThe table below reconciles segment operating profit to total operating profit:\nN/M - Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful\n1\n2023 includes employee severance charges of $90 million, acquisition-related costs of $69 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $49 million, a gain on disposition of $46 million, an asset impairment of $5 million and an asset write-off of $1 million. 2022 includes a gain on disposition of $1.8 billion, employee severance charges of $90 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $35 million and acquisition-related costs of $2 million. 2021 includes employee severance charges of $3 million, a gain on disposition of $3 million, acquisition-related costs of $2 million and lease-related costs of $1 million. 2023, 2022 and 2021 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $561 million, $474 million and $65 million, respectively.\n2\n2023 includes employee severance charges of $10 million and an asset impairment of $1 million. 2022 includes employee severance charges of $24 million, legal costs of $5 million and an asset write-off of $1 million. 2021 includes a gain on disposition of $6 million, recovery of lease-related costs of $4 million and employee severance charges of $3 million. 2023, 2022 and 2021, include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $8 million, $7 million and $10 million, respectively.\n3\n2023 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $35 million, employee severance charges of $26 million and acquisition-related costs of $2 million. 2022 includes employee severance charges of $45 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $26 million. 2021 includes recovery of lease-related costs of $2 million. 2023, 2022 and 2021 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $131 million, $111 million and $8 million, respectively.\n4\n2023 includes employee severance charges of $9 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $3 million and acquisition-related costs of $2 million. 2022 includes an acquisition-related benefit of $14 million, employee severance charges of $4 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $3 million. 2023 and 2022 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $301 million and $241 million, respectively.\n5\n2023 includes employee severance charges of $5 million, a gain on disposition of $4 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $4 million. 2022 includes a gain on disposition of $52 million, employee severance charges of $14 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $2 million. 2021 includes recovery of lease-related costs of $1 million. 2023, 2022 and 2021 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $36 million, $31 million and $6 million, respectively.\n45\nTable of Contents\n6\n2023\nincludes\namortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $1 million. 2\n022 includes employee severance charges of $4 million and\namortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $35 million.\n7\n2023 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $147 million, a loss on disposition of $120 million, employee severance charges of $43 million, disposition-related costs of $24 million, lease impairments of $14 million and acquisition-related costs of $4 million. 2022 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $553 million, a S&P Foundation grant of $200 million, employee severance charges of $107 million, disposition-related costs of $24 million, a gain on acquisition of $10 million, an asset impairment of $9 million, acquisition-related costs of $8 million, lease impairments of $5 million and an asset write-off of $3 million. 2021 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $249 million, employee severance charges of $13 million,  lease-related costs of $4 million, a lease impairment of $3 million, Kensho retention related expenses of $2 million, acquisition-related costs of $2 million and a gain on disposition of $2 million. 2023, 2022 and 2021 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $3 million, $4 million and $7 million, respectively.\n8\n2023 includes an asset impairment of $2 million. 2023 and 2022 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $56 million and $55 million, respectively.\n2023\nSegment Operating Profit —\nDecreased 24% as compared to 2022. Excluding the unfavorable impact of a higher gain on dispositions in 2022 of 33 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2023 of 2 percentage points and higher acquisition-related costs of 1 percentage point, partially offset by higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 1 percentage point, segment operating profit increased 12%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher compensation costs and increased incentives. See “Segment Review” below for further information.\nCorporate Unallocated Expense\n—\nCorporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses. Corporate Unallocated expense decreased 49% compared to 2022. Excluding the impact of higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 of 15 percentage points, a S&P Foundation grant in 2022 of 7 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by a loss on disposition in 2023 of 4 percentage points, Corporate Unallocated expense increased 69% primarily due to increased incentives.\nEquity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\n— The Company holds an investment in a 50/50 joint venture arrangement with shared control with CME Group that combined each of the company’s post-trade services into a new joint venture, OSTTRA. The joint venture provides trade processing and risk mitigation operations and incorporates CME Group’s optimization businesses (Traiana, TriOptima, and Reset) and the Company’s MarkitSERV business. The combination is intended to increase operating efficiencies of both the company’s business to more effectively service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity, and credit asset classes. Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries includes the OSTTRA joint venture acquired in connection with the merger with IHS Markit. Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries was $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nForeign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by re-calculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual businesses functional currency.\n2022\nSegment Operating Profit —\nIncreased 27% as compared to 2021. Excluding the favorable impact of a higher gain on dispositions in 2022 of 41 percentage points, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2022 of 18 percentage points, higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 4 percentage points and IHS Markit merger related costs in 2022 of 1 percentage point, segment operating profit increased 9%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, lower incentive costs and lower occupancy costs from reduced real estate footprint, partially offset by a decrease in revenue at Ratings, expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, an increase in compensation costs driven by additional headcount and annual merit and promotion increases, the resumption of business travel from the lifting of COVID restrictions and an increase in technology expenses. See “Segment Review” below for further information.\nCorporate Unallocated Expense—\nCorporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses. Corporate Unallocated expense increased 132%  compared to 2021. Excluding higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 of 85 percentage points, a S&P Foundation grant in 2022 of 56 percentage points, higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 26 percentage points, disposition-related costs in 2022 of 7 percentage points, an asset impairment in 2022 of 2 percentage points and higher acquisition-related costs in 2022 of 1\n46\nTable of Contents\npercentage point, partially offset by a gain on acquisition in 2022 of 3 percentage points and lower amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2022 of 1 percentage point, Corporate Unallocated expense decreased 41%  primarily due to cost synergies and lower incentive costs.\nEquity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\n— The Company holds an investment in a 50/50 joint venture arrangement with shared control with CME Group that combined each of the company’s post-trade services into a new joint venture, OSTTRA.

The combination is intended to increase operating efficiencies of both the company’s business to more effectively service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity, and credit asset classes. Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries includes the OSTTRA joint venture acquired in connection with the merger with IHS Markit. Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries was $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nForeign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on operating profit of less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by re-calculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual businesses functional currency.\nOther Income , net\nOther expense (income), net primarily includes the net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and post retirement plans.\nOther expense, net for 2023 was $15 million and other income, net was\n$70 million and  $62 million for 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively\n. During 2023 and 2022, lump sum withdrawals exceeded the combined total anticipated annual service and interest cost of our U.S. retirement plan and U.K. plan, respectively, triggering the recognition of a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $23 million and $13 million, respectively. Excluding these pre-tax settlement charges, other income, net was\n$9 million\n,\n$83 million\n, and $62 million for 2023, 2022, 2021, respectively. The decrease in other income, net in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to losses on our mark-to-market investments in 2023 compared to gains in 2022 and the increase in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to a higher gain on investments in 2022.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense for 2023 increased $30 million compared to 2022 primarily due to the issuance of $750 million 5.25% senior notes in September of 2023 and incremental expense related to commercial paper borrowings. Net interest expense for 2022 increased $185 million compared to 2021 primarily due to higher debt balances. See Note 5 -\nDebt\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net\nIn 2022, we recognized an\n$8 million\nloss on extinguishment of debt which includes a tender premium paid to tendering note holders in accordance with the terms of the tender offer of $142 million, partially offset by a $134 million non-cash write-off related to the fair market value step up premium on extinguished debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 21.2%, 25.1% and 21.6% for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Fluctuation in tax rates by year is primarily due to tax charge on merger related divestitures and change in mix of income by jurisdiction.\nSegment Review\nMarket Intelligence\nMarket Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions.

Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence represents revenue from contracts for services that specify a fee based on, among other factors, the number of trades processed, assets under management, or the number of positions  valued. Non-subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily related to certain advisory, pricing conferences and events, and analytical services.\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\nN/M – Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful\n1\n2023 includes employee severance charges of $90 million, acquisition-related costs of $69 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $49 million, a gain on disposition of $46 million, an asset impairment of $5 million and an asset write-off of $1 million. 2022 includes a gain on dispositions of $1.8 billion, employee severance charges of $90 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $35 million and acquisition-related costs of $2 million. 2021 includes employee severance charges of $3 million, a gain on disposition of $3 million, acquisition-related costs of $2 million and lease-related costs of $1 million. 2023, 2022 and 2021 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $561 million, $474 million and $65 million, respectively.\n2023\nRevenue increased 15% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Subscription revenue growth for Market Intelligence Desktop products, RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect®, and data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions also contributed to revenue growth. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit decreased 71%.

Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.\n2022\nRevenue increased 74% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Subscription revenue growth for certain Market Intelligence Desktop products, RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect®, and certain data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions also contributed to revenue growth.

Product launches and innovation continued at Market Intelligence in 2023 with the introduction of several new products and product features leveraging technology investments.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nThe market for data, analytical capabilities and research services is intensely competitive, ranging from established firms to fast evolving market disruptors. Market Intelligence competes domestically and internationally based on a number of factors, including the quality and range of its data, analytical capabilities, research services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, and technological innovation.\nMarket Intelligence is subject to global regulation, particularly in the European Union, the U.K., the U.S. and increasingly so in other jurisdictions.  Several laws and regulations in the European Union, the U.K. and the U.S. have been adopted but not yet implemented, or have been proposed or are being considered, to which Market Intelligence, or its clients, will or may become subject, including laws and regulations related to pricing providers, sustainability, credit rating data, data privacy and cyber security and technology and organizational resilience.  For example, the EU passed the Digital Operational Resilience Act in December 2022 (“DORA”), which will take effect by the end of January 2025. DORA will impose operational resilience and cyber security standards and obligations, including technical and organizational standards and responsibilities which may require technology and/or organizational investment, upon (i) many Market Intelligence financial market clients, who may look to pass such obligations onto vendors like Market Intelligence, and (ii) information and communications technology providers designated by the EU as “Critical Third Party Providers,” which may, or may not, include Market Intelligence.  In addition, from time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.\nAt this time, the impact on Market Intelligence of any such recently adopted or proposed laws or regulations, or market studies, remains uncertain, but they could increase the regulatory exposure of Market Intelligence or the costs and legal risks relating to Market Intelligence’s activities, adversely affect the ability of Market Intelligence to provide its products and services, or result in changes in the demand for its products and services. If Market Intelligence fails to comply with any such laws or regulations, it could be subject to significant litigation, civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines. Regulatory developments may also present commercial opportunities to Market Intelligence to develop further or different services to enable better compliance by its clients.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Market Intelligence business, see Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Market Intelligence business, see Note 13 –\nCommitments and Contingencies\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8,\nConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRatings\nRatings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.\nRatings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:\n•\nratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and\n•\nbank loan ratings.\n50\nTable of Contents\nNon-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $154 million, $143 million\nan\nd $136 million, respectively.\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\n1\n2023 includes employee severance charges of $10 million and an asset impairment of $1 million. 2022\nincludes\nemployee severance charges of $24 million, legal costs of $5 million and an asset write-off of $1 million\n. 2021 includes a gain on disposition of $6 million, recovery of lease-related costs of $4 million and employee severance charges of $3 million. 2023, 2022 and 2021 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $8 million, $7 million and $10 million, respectively.\n2023\nRevenue increased 9%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue primarily driven by increased high-yield and investment-grade issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. An increase in bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity also contributed to transaction revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary, partially offset by a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories.\nOperating profit increased 11%. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance costs in 2022 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 10% due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher current-year compensation costs and prior-year write-downs in incentive compensation as result of financial performance.\n2022\nRevenue decreased 26% with an unfav\norable impact from foreign exchange rates of 3 percentage points. Transaction revenue decreased due to lower corporate bond ratings revenue driven by a decrease in high-yield and investment-grade issuance volumes and lower bank loan ratings revenue. A decrease in structured finance revenues primarily driven by decreased issuance of U.S. collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) also contributed to the decrease in transaction revenue. Reduced issuance volumes mainly resulted from unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in 2022 compared to strong issuance levels in the prior year period. Non-transaction revenue decreased 2% primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, a decrease in entity credit ratings revenue and lower\nRatings Evaluation Service (\n“RES”) revenue driven by decreased M&A activity, partially offset by an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary and an increase in surveillance revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 3 percentage points, non-transaction revenue increased 1%. Transaction\n51\nTable of Contents\nand non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories.\nOperating profit decreased 36%, with an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. Excluding the impact of employee severance charges in 2022 of 1 percentage point, operating profit decreased 35% primarily due to a decline in revenue partially offset by decrease in expenses. The decrease in expenses was driven by lower incentive costs due to weaker financial performance, lower outside services expenses, lower occupancy costs from reduced real estate footprint, partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by targeted investments into key areas of the business, and the resumption of business travel from the lifting of COVID restrictions.\nMarket Issuance Volumes\nWe monitor market issuance volumes regularly within Ratings. Market issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located. Structured Finance issuance includes amounts when a transaction closes, not when initially priced, and excludes domestically rated Chinese issuance. The following tables depict changes in issuance levels as compared to the prior year based on data from SDC Platinum for Corporate bond issuance and based on a composite of external data feeds and Ratings’ internal estimates for Structured Finance issuance.\nNote  – Global issuance includes U.S., Europe, Asia and the rest of the world.\n*\nIncludes Industrials and Financial Services.\n**\nIncludes rated and non-rated issuance.\n•\nCorporate issuance was up in the U.S. and Europe due to an increase in refinancing activity.\n*\nRepresents no activity in 2023 or 2022.\n•\nABS issuance increased in the U.S. and Europe driven by auto loans, with Europe also up from a low 2022 base.\n•\nCLO issuance was down in the U.S. and Europe structured credit markets due to a decline in new issuance.\n•\nCMBS and RMBS issuance was down in the U.S. reflecting unfavorable market conditions.\n•\nCovered bond (debt securities backed by mortgages or other high-quality assets that remain on the issuer's balance sheet) issuance in Europe increased as cheaper government funding programs slowed down.\n52\nTable of Contents\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nRevenue increased in 2023 primarily driven by an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue, bank loan ratings revenue and an increase in non-transaction revenue. Increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity drove increases in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue. CRISIL revenue increased across all segments, led by Global Benchmarking Analytics and Global Research & Risk Solutions. Sustainability initiatives and international expansion in China continue to be areas of focus for Ratings.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nGeneral\nRatings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries, and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company’s operations and the markets in which it operates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. In addition, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. We have reviewed the new laws, regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required. We do not believe that such new laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are from time to time considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including, for example, provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings or to increase competition among credit rating agencies, provisions regarding remuneration and rotation of credit rating agencies, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. Similarly, other laws, regulations and rules are being considered or are likely to be considered in the future that may impact ancillary and other services provided by Ratings in addition to its credit rating products and services, for example regulatory oversight regimes for ESG ratings providers such as the proposal for an EU regulation on the transparency and integrity of ESG rating activities.  The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to Ratings’ activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete and/or our remuneration, or result in changes in the demand for our products and services.\nIn the normal course of business both in the U.S. and abroad, Ratings (or the legal entities comprising Ratings) are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries (including market studies). Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of Ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into Ratings’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries (including market studies) could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties, activity restrictions or negative impacts on our cash flow, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.\nU.S.\nThe businesses conducted by our Ratings segment are, in certain cases, regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd Frank Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which our Ratings segment conducts business. The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S.\nS&P Global Ratings is a credit rating agency that is registered with the SEC as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). The SEC first began informally designating NRSROs in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the SEC’s Net Capital Rule. The Reform Act created a new SEC registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as NRSROs. Under the Reform Act, the SEC is given authority and oversight of NRSROs and can censure NRSROs, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases. The rules implemented by the SEC pursuant to the Reform Act, the Dodd Frank Act and the Exchange Act address, among other things, prevention or misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest, documentation and assessment of internal controls, and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. The public portions of the current version of S&P Global Ratings’ Form NRSRO are available on S&P Global Ratings’ website.\nEuropean Union\nIn the European Union (\"EU\"), the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions. In 2009, the European Parliament passed a regulation (“CRA1”) that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the EU, which became effective in 2010. CRA1\n53\nTable of Contents\nrequires the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the EU. Ratings was granted registration in October of 2011. In January of 2011, the EU established the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), which, among other things, has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the EU.\nAdditional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013. Commonly referred to as CRA3, these rules, among other things:\n•\nimpose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers;\n•\nrequire member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations;\n•\nimpose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer;\n•\nimpose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed; and\n•\nimpose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.\nFrom January 2025, Ratings will be subject in the EU to new operational resilience and cyber security standards under the Digital Operational Resilience Act, including technical and organizational standards and responsibilities which may require technology and/or organizational investment.\nThe financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the EU.\nUnited Kingdom\nFollowing its exit from the European Union, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) established a credit rating agencies oversight regime with rules that closely mirror those in place in the EU. Ratings was granted registration with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) on January 1, 2021. It is possible that the rules applicable to credit rating agencies in the U.K. will diverge from those in the EU in the future as a result of changes to one or the other legislative regime or differing approaches by the FCA and ESMA.\nOther Jurisdictions\nOutside of the U.S., the EU and the U.K., regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies. Ratings is subject to regulations in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements. Regulators in additional countries may introduce new regulations in the future.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Ratings business, see Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Commodity Insights provides essential price data, analytics, industry insights and software & services, enabling the commodity and energy markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency.\nCommodity Insights includes the following business lines:\n•\nEnergy & Resources Data & Insights — includes data, news, insights, and analytics for petroleum, gas, power & renewables, petrochemicals, metals & steel, agriculture, and other commodities;\n•\nPrice Assessments — includes price assessments and benchmarks, and forward curves;\n•\nUpstream Data & Insights — includes exploration & production data and insights, software and analytics; and\n•\nAdvisory & Transactional Services — includes consulting services, conferences, events and global trading services.\n54\nTable of Contents\nCommodity Insights’ revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:\n•\nSubscription revenue\n—\nprimarily from subscriptions to our market data and market insights (price assessments, market reports and commentary and analytics) along with other information products and software term licenses;\n•\nSales usage-based royalties\n—\nprimarily from licensing our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges; and\n•\nNon-subscription revenue\n—\nconference sponsorship, consulting engagements, events, and perpetual software licenses.\nSee Note 2 -\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion including information on the merger with IHS Markit.\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\nN/M- Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful\n1\n2023 include\ns IHS Markit merger costs of $35 million, employee severance charges of $26 million and acquisition-related costs of $2 million. 2022 inc\nludes\nemployee severance charges of $45 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $26 million\n. 2021 includes recovery of lease-related costs of $2 million. 2023, 2022 and 2021 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $131 million, $111 million, and $8 million, respectively.\n2023\nRevenue increased 16% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts and higher conference revenue. An increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data and price assessments to commodity exchanges mainly due to increased trading volumes also contributed to revenue growth. The Energy & Resources Data & Insights, Price Assessments and Upstream Data & Insights businesses continue to be the most significant revenue streams, followed by the Advisory & Transactional Services business. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\n55\nTable of Contents\nOperating profit increased 19%. Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2023 of 6 percentage points and higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 3 percentage point, partially offset by higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 6 percentage points, operating profit increased 16%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, higher compensation costs, increased incentives, an increase in costs related to the Commodity Insights conferences in 2023 and an increase in strategic investments. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.\n2022\nRevenue increased 66% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts and higher conference revenue driven by the return of in-person attendance at Commodity Insights conferences in 2022 compared to virtual events in 2021. The Energy & Resources Data & Insights, Price Assessments and Upstream Data & Insights businesses continue to be the most significant revenue drivers, followed by the Advisory & Transactional Services business, which contributed large growth in the first quarter of 2022. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 9%. Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 19 percentage points, employee severance charges in 2022 of 8 percentage points and IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 of 5 percentage points, operating profit increased 41%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, an increase in costs related to the Commodity Insights conferences in 2022, higher compensation costs, the resumption of business travel from the lifting of COVID restrictions and an increase in operating costs to support business initiatives at Commodity Insights. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nIn 2023, the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, sustained demand for market data and market insights products, higher conference revenue and an increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data and price assessments to commodity exchanges mainly due to increased trading volumes contributed to revenue growth. Commodity Insights launched new products in 2023 including Platts Connect, a web/mobile based application integrating Platts & IHS Markit’s energy and commodities content through one integrated platform. Commodity Insights continues to focus on developing new products and product features leveraging technology investments and developing key product offerings in sustainability, including energy transition.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nCommodity Insights' price assessment business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny.  Commodity Insights is subject to commodity benchmark regulation in the EU (the “EU Benchmark Regulation”) and the U.K. (the \"U.K. Benchmark Regulation\"), as well as increasing regulation in other jurisdictions. Commodity Insights has obtained authorization and is now supervised by the\nDutch Authority for the Financial Markets\nin the Netherlands under the EU Benchmark Regulation, and it will likely need to take similar steps in other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom when the transitional period under the EU Benchmark Regulation (and its equivalent under the U.K. Benchmark Regulation) ends, as well as in jurisdictions outside of Europe implementing similar legislation.\nThe EU's package of legislative measures called the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (collectively \"MiFID II\")have applied in all EU Member States since 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research and direct  how asset managers pay for research either out of a research payment account or from a firm’s profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the E.U. Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). MiFID II and potential subsequent amendments may result in changes to the manner in which the Commodity Insights business licenses its price assessments. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation may impose additional regulatory burdens on Commodity Insights activities in the EU over time, but their impact on, and costs to, the Company have not yet been substantive.\nIn October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies (\"PRA Principles\"), which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCommodity Insights has aligned its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.\nFrom time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Commodity Insights business, see Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Commodity Insights business, see Note 13 –\nCommitments and Contingencies\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8,\nConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMobility\nMobility is a leading provider of solutions serving the full automotive value chain including vehicle manufacturers (OEMs), automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies.\nIn February of 2023, we completed the acquisition of Market Scan Information Systems Inc. (“Market Scan”), a leading provider of automotive pricing and incentive intelligence, including Automotive Payments as a Service\nTM\nand its powerful payment calculation engine. The addition of Market Scan to Mobility enabled the integration of detailed transaction intelligence in areas that are complementary to existing services for dealers, OEMs, lenders, and other market participants. The acquisition of Market Scan is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nMobility includes the following business lines:\n•\nDealer\n—\nincludes analytics to predict future buyers, targeted marketing, and vehicle history data to allow people to shop, buy, service and sell used cars;\n•\nManufacturing\n—\nincludes insights, forecasts and advisory services spanning the entire automotive value chain, from product planning to marketing, sales and the aftermarket; and\n•\nFinancial\n—\nincludes reports and data feeds to support lenders and insurance companies\n.\nMobility’s revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:\n•\nSubscription revenue\n—\nMobility’s core information products provide critical information and insights to all global OEMs, most of the world’s leading suppliers, and the majority of North American dealerships. Mobility operates across both the new and used car markets. Mobility provides data and insight on future vehicles sales and production, including detailed forecasts on technology and vehicle components; supplies car makers and dealers with market reporting products, predictive analytics and marketing automation software; and supports dealers with vehicle history reports, used car listings and service retention services. Mobility also sells a range of services to financial institutions, to support their marketing, insurance underwriting and claims management activities; and\n•\nNon-subscription revenue\n—\nOne-time transactional sales of data that are non-cyclical in nature – and that are usually tied to underlying business metrics such as OEM marketing spend or safety recall activity – as well as consulting and advisory services.\nThe Mobility business was acquired in connection with the merger with IHS Markit on February 28, 2022 and financial results are included since the date of acquisition.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\nN/M- Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful\n1\n2023 includes employee severance charges of $9 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $3 million and acquisition-related costs of $2 million. 2022 includes an acquisition-related benefit of $14 million, employee severance charges of $4 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $3 million. 2023 and 2022 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $301 million and $241 million, respectively.\n2023\nRevenue increased 30% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, price increases and new business growth within the Dealer business as well as the favorable impact of the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023. Increases within the Financial business due to strong underwriting volumes and the Manufacturing business due to strong recall activity and uptick in marketing solutions also contributed to revenue growth. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 22%. Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2023 of 5 percentage points, an acquisition-related benefit in 2022 of 1 percentage point and higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 29% driven by revenue growth, partially offset by the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, higher compensation costs, increased incentives, higher technology costs and expenses associated with the acquisition of Market Scan. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points.\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nIn 2023, Mobility delivered revenue growth across its businesses. Specifically, strong new business growth and the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023 within the Dealer business contributed to revenue growth. Mobility continued to focus on multiple growth opportunities including: evolving our forecasting business to encompass new technologies and new forms of mobility; supporting the industry in its transformation to hybrid electric vehicles and digital retail; enabling consumers to shop, buy, service and sell used cars; and, leveraging the power of S&P Global to develop products for financial markets and to facilitate the industry’s transition towards sustainable mobility.\n58\nTable of Contents\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nCertain types of information that our Mobility business collects, compiles, stores, uses, transfers, publishes and/or sells is subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates. There is an increasing public concern regarding, and resulting regulations of, privacy, data, and consumer protection issues. Certain laws and regulations to which our Mobility business is subject pertain to personally identifiable information relating to individuals. Such laws and regulations constrain the collection, use, storage, and transfer of personally identifiable information, and impose other obligations with which we must comply. Other regulation geared at consumer protection such as the Federal Trade Commission's CARS Rule announced in December 2023 sets a framework to ensure transparency throughout the vehicle buying and leasing process and could therefore impact Mobility's products and services. If our Mobility business fails to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation and civil or criminal penalties (including monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines) in one or more jurisdictions and reputational damage resulting in the loss of data, brand equity and business. To conduct our operations, our Mobility business also moves data across national borders and consequently can be subject to a variety of evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security in an increasing number of jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, such as the U.S. Driver's Privacy Protection Act (\"DPPA\"), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the cyber-security law adopted by China in 2017, the separate consumer privacy laws in California and other states in the U.S., as well as other jurisdictions considering imposing such restrictions. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which our Mobility business operates, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. It is possible that our Mobility business could be prohibited or constrained from collecting or disseminating certain types of data or from providing certain products or services. If our Mobility business fails to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation, civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. For example, a failure to comply with the GDPR could result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues or in the case of a DPPA violation, U.S. courts may award liquidated damages of $2,500 per individual's personal information. Additional risks are presented by the evolving landscape related to sanctions and export control laws. The landscape related to these laws is evolving rapidly and presents compliance challenges to all businesses covered by these laws. In addition, from time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Mobility business, see Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products, and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $52 million ($43 million after-tax) for the sale of a family of leveraged loan indices in Loss (gain) on dispositions in the consolidated statements of income.\nIndices derives revenue from asset-linked fees when investors direct funds into its proprietary designed or owned indexes, sales usage-based royalties of its indices, as well as data subscription arrangements. Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources:\n•\nInvestment vehicles\n—\nasset-linked fees such as ETFs and mutual funds, that are based on the S&P Dow Jones Indices’ benchmarks that generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;\n•\nExchange traded derivatives\n—\ngenerate sales usage-based royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;\n•\nIndex-related licensing fees\n—\nfixed or variable annual and per-issue asset-linked fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and\n•\nData and customized index subscription fees\n—\nfees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\n1\n2023 includes employee severance charges of $5 million, a gain on disposition of $4 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $4 million. 2022 i\nncludes\na gain on disposition of $52 million, employee severance charges of $14 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $2 million\n.\n2021 includes\nrecovery of lease-related costs of $1 million\n. 2023, 2022 and 2021 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $36 million, $31 million and $6 million.\n2023\nRevenue at Indices increased 5% primarily due to higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by continued strength in average trading volume and higher data subscription revenue, partially offset by lower over-the-counter derivatives revenue. Asset linked fees remained relatively unchanged at Indices due to higher average levels of assets under management (“AUM”) for ETFs, offset by product mix. Average levels of AUM for ETFs increased 8% to $2.895 trillion and ending AUM for ETFs increased 27% to $3.303 trillion compared to 2022. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit remained unchanged, decreasing less than 1%. Excluding the impact of a higher gain on dispositions in 2022 of 5 percentage points and higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2023 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by  higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 5% due to revenue growth partially offset by increased compensation costs and incentives. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\n2022\nRevenue at Indices increased 17% primarily due to higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by higher average trading volume from increased volatility, higher average levels of AUM for mutual funds, higher data subscription revenue and the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Ending AUM for ETFs in 2022 was $2.601 trillion. Excluding AUM related to the merger with IHS Markit, ending AUM for ETFs decreased 12% to $2.466 trillion and average levels of AUM for ETFs\n60\nTable of Contents\nincreased 5% to $2.526 trillion compared to 2021. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 16%. Excluding the impact of a gain on disposition of 7 percentage points, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 4 percentage points and employee severance charges in 2022 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 15%. The impact of revenue growth and lower incentive costs were partially offset by an increase in outside services expenses, strategic investments, higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases, higher data costs, the resumption of business travel from the lifting of COVID restrictions and the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nRevenue increased in 2023 primarily due to higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by continued strength in average trading volume, higher data subscription revenue and higher average levels of AUM for ETFs, partially offset by lower over-the-counter derivatives revenue. Indices continues to be a leading index provider for the ETF market space. Sustainability, thematic and factor indices and multi-asset-class indices continue to be key strategic growth areas for Indices.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nThe financial benchmarks industry is subject to specific benchmark regulation in the European Union (the \"EU Benchmark Regulation\"), the United Kingdom (the \"U.K. Benchmark Regulation\"), and Australia (the \"Australia Benchmark Regulation\"). Various other jurisdictions, including the United States, India, Canada and South Africa, are also considering the regulation of financial benchmarks through new or existing regimes.\nAlthough they vary in scope, the requirements of the EU Benchmark Regulation, the U.K. Benchmark Regulation and the Australian Benchmark Regulation are similar. Indices currently maintains a benchmark administrator in both the Netherlands (authorized by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM)) for its benchmark activities in the European Union and in the United Kingdom (authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority) for its\nbenchmark activities in the United Kingdom. The Australian Benchmark Regulation requires a license from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (“ASIC”), which Indices has obtained. These benchmark regulations have and may continue to cause increased operating obligations, exposure, compliance risk, and costs of doing business for Indices.\nIn July of 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks (the “Financial Benchmark Principles”), intended to promote the reliability of financial benchmarks. The Financial Benchmark Principles address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by Indices. Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime, control framework and operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles and engages an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of its adherence to the Financial Benchmark Principles.\nFrom time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Indices business, see Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

See Note 2 -\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the sale of Engineering Solutions and the merger with IHS Markit.\nEngineering Solutions included our Product Design offerings that provided technical professionals with the information and insight required to more effectively design products, optimize engineering projects and outcomes, solve technical problems and address complex supply chain issues. Our offerings utilized advanced knowledge discovery technologies, research tools, and software-based engineering decision engines to advance innovation, maximize productivity, improve quality and reduce risk.\n61\nTable of Contents\nEngineering Solutions’ revenue was generated primarily through the following sources:\n•\nSubscription revenue\n—\nprimarily from subscriptions to our Product Design offerings providing standards, codes and specifications; applied technical reference; engineering journals, reports, best practices, and other vetted technical reference; and patents and patent applications, which includes Engineering Workbench; Goldfire’s cognitive search and other advanced knowledge discovery capabilities that help pinpoint answers buried in enterprise systems and unstructured data enabling engineers and technical professionals to accelerate problem solving; and\n•\nNon-subscription revenue\n—\nprimarily from retail transaction and consulting services.\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\nN/M- Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful\n1\n2023 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $1 million. 2022 includes employee severance charges of $4 million and amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $35 million.\n2023\nRevenue decreased 59% as a result of the sale of Engineering Solutions. Operating profit increased 24%. Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2022 of 77 percentage points and employee severance charges in 2022 of 10 percentage points, operating profit decreased 63% as a result of the sale of Engineering Solutions. As of May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of Engineering Solutions and the results are included through that date. The Engineering Solutions business was acquired in connection with the merger with IHS Markit on February 28, 2022 and the financial results are included since the date of acquisition through May 2, 2023.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nThe legal and regulatory environment for the Engineering Solutions business is similar to our Mobility Business. See “\nMobility – Legal and Regulatory Environment\n” above for additional details about the legal and regulatory environment for our Engineering Solutions business.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Engineering Solutions business, see Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Engineering Solutions business, see Note 13 –\nCommitments and Contingencies\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8,\nConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n62\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators. In 2024, cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs in the short term and into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.\nCash Flow Overview\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIn 2023, free cash flow increased to $3.3 billion compared to $2.2 billion in 2022 primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities as discussed below. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.\nOperating activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased to $3.7 billion in 2023 as compared to $2.6 billion in 2022. The increase is mainly due to higher operating results in 2023, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022, higher taxes paid on divestitures in 2022 and a grant payment to the S&P Global Foundation in 2022.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased to $2.6 billion in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease is mainly due to a decrease in operating results, an increase in IHS Markit merger costs, higher taxes paid on divestitures and a grant payment to the S&P Global Foundation in 2022.\nDuring 2023, our cash taxes were adversely impacted by the requirement to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses under Section 174. Although Congress is considering legislation that would reinstate and extend Section 174 expensing for certain research and experimental expenditures, the possibility that this will happen is uncertain. Refer to Note 4 –\nTaxes on Income\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions are in the process of implementing it. The Company is currently monitoring these developments and is in the process of evaluating the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nInvesting activities\nOur cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.\nCash provided by investing activities was $0.6 billion for 2023 as compared to $3.6 billion in 2022, primarily due to higher cash proceeds received from dispositions in 2022 related to the dispositions of CUSIP Global Services, Oil Price Information Services, the Leveraged Commentary and Data business and a related family of leveraged loan indices, and the Base Chemicals business.\nCash provided by investing activities was $3.6 billion for 2022 as compared to cash used for investing activities of $0.1 billion in 2021, primarily due to cash received from the dispositions of CUSIP Global Services, Oil Price Information Services, the\n63\nTable of Contents\nLeveraged Commentary and Data business and a related family of leveraged loan indices, and the Base Chemicals business in 2022.\nRefer to Note 2 –\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nFinancing activities\nOur cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily inflows from long-term and short-term debt borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash used for financing activities decreased to $4.3 billion in 2023 from $11.3 billion in 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases in 2023.\nCash used for financing activities increased to $11.3 billion in 2022 from $1.0 billion in 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in cash used for share repurchases in 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we purchased a total of 8.6 million shares for $3.3 billion of cash. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased a total of 33.5 million shares for $12.0 billion of cash. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not use cash to purchase any shares. See Note 9\n— Equity\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements.\nOn June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2020 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 12% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. As of December 31, 2023, 18.7 million shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program and the 2020 Repurchase Program was completed.\nAdditional Financing\nWe have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (our “credit facility”) that will terminate on April 26, 2026. As of December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding commercial paper. As of December 31, 2022, there was $188 million of commercial paper outstanding.\nCommitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 8 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.\nThe only financial covenant required under our credit facility is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.\nDividends\nOn January 23, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.91 per share.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nThe senior notes described below were issued by S&P Global Inc. and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company.\n•\nOn September 12, 2023, we issued $750 million of 5.25% senior notes due in 2033.\n•\nOn March 1, 2023, S&P Global Inc. issued new senior notes that have been registered with the SEC and guaranteed by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC in exchange for the following series of unregistered senior notes of like principal amount and terms:\n•\n$700 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2028 that were originally issued on March 2, 2022;\n•\n$921 million of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2029 that were originally issued on March 2, 2022;\n64\nTable of Contents\n•\n$1,237 million of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2027 that were originally issued on March 18, 2022;\n•\n$1,227 million of 2.70% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2029 that were originally issued on March 18, 2022;\n•\n$1,492 million of 2.90% Senior Notes due 2032 that were originally issued on March 18, 2022;\n•\n$974 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due 2052 that were originally issued on March 18, 2022; and\n•\n$500 million of 3.90% Senior Notes due 2062 that were originally issued on March 18, 2022.\n•\nOn August 13, 2020, we issued $600 million of 1.25% senior notes due in 2030 and $700 million of 2.3% senior notes due in 2060.\n•\nOn November 26, 2019, we issued $500 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2029 and $600 million of 3.25% senior notes due in 2049.\n•\nOn May 17, 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.5% senior notes due in 2048.\n•\nOn September 22, 2016, we issued $500 million of 2.95% senior notes due in 2027.\n•\nOn May 26, 2015, we issued $700 million of 4.0% senior notes due in 2025.\n•\nOn November 2, 2007 we issued $400 million of 6.55% Senior Notes due 2037.\nThe notes above are unsecured and unsubordinated and rank equally and ratably with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The guarantees are the subsidiary guarantor’s unsecured and unsubordinated debt and rank equally and ratably with all of the subsidiary guarantor’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt.\nThe guarantees of the subsidiary guarantor may be released and discharged upon (i) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the subsidiary guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the subsidiary guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a person who, prior to such sale or other disposition, is an affiliate of the Company); (ii) upon defeasance or discharge of any applicable series of the notes, as described above; or (iii) at such time as the subsidiary guarantor ceases to guarantee indebtedness for borrowed money, other than a discharge through payment thereon, under any Credit Facility of the Company, other than any such Credit Facility of the Company the guarantee of which by the subsidiary guarantor will be released concurrently with the release of the subsidiary guarantor’s guarantees of the notes.\nOther subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either S&P Global Inc. or Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC (the  “Obligor Group”) which are referred to as the “Non-Obligor Group”.\nThe following tables set forth the summarized financial information of the Obligor Group on a combined basis. This  summarized financial information excludes the Non-Obligor Group. Intercompany balances and transactions between members of the Obligor Group have been eliminated. This information is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nSummarized results of operations for the year ended December 31 is as follows:\nSummarized balance sheet information as of December 31 is as follows:\nContractual Obligations\nWe typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized, but are disclosed herein.\n65\nTable of Contents\nFor example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance.\nWe believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for 2024.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2023, over the next several years. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the footnotes to the table:\n1\nOur debt obligations are described in Note 5 –\nDebt\nto our consolidated financial statement.\n2\nSee Note 13 –\nCommitments and Contingencies\nto our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our operating lease obligations\n.\n3\nOther consists primarily of commitments for unconditional purchase obligations in contracts for information-technology outsourcing and certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $230 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. We have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because, until formal resolutions are reached, reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have recorded $3.8 billion for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC partnership discussed in Note 9 –\nEquity\nto our consolidated financial statements.  Specifically, this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, whereby, after December 31, 2017, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC (“CGIS”) has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20% of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. We have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make.\nWe make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans. During 2023, we contributed $10 million to our retirement plans. Expected employer contributions in 2024 are $11 million and $3 million for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. In 2024, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. See Note 7 –\nEmployee Benefits\nto our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n66\nTable of Contents\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow.\nWe believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock.\nThe presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow:\nN/M – Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nManagement considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this MD&A.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n67\nTable of Contents\nRevenue recognition\nUnder ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 1 -\nAccounting Policies\nto our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nBusiness combinations\nWe apply the purchase method of accounting to our business combinations. All of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration are allocated based on their estimated fair values. Fair value determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions about several highly subjective variables, including future cash flows, discount rates, and expected business performance. There are also different valuation models and inputs for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. Our estimates and assumptions may be based, in part, on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data. These determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. Depending on the size of the purchase price of a particular acquisition, the mix of intangible assets acquired, and expected business performance, the purchase price allocation could be materially impacted by applying a different set of assumptions and estimates.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions, and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. The impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately $29 million.\nWe incorporate the forecasted impact of future economic conditions into our allowance for doubtful accounts measurement process.  In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2024.\nAccounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management’s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $35.7 billion and $35.4 billion, respectively. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\nGoodwill\nAs part of our annual impairment test of our five reporting units, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a quantitative impairment test. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. For 2023, based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair values were greater than their respective carrying amounts.\n68\nTable of Contents\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.\nWe performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nRetirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits\nOur employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from our assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants. While we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.\nThe following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits:\n•\nDiscount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.\n•\nThe expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term.\nOur discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our U.S. retirement plans are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.1 billion in pension benefit obligation for our U.S. retirement plans. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in an estimated decrease or increase to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $28 million and an increase in 2024 pension expense of approximately $1 million. An increase or decrease of 1 percentage point in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease or increase of approximately $14 million to 2024 pension expense.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.\n69\nTable of Contents\nJudgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2024. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have approximately $7.1 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $4.3 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We recognize a liability for such contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nThe fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $3.8 billion in redeemable noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ultimate amount paid for the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business could be significantly different because the redemption amount depends on the future results of operations of the business.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the weighted average cost of capital used in the Company's income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 10%. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of capital would decrease or increase the redemption value by approximately $81 million or $108 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the terminal growth rate used in the Company's income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 2.2%. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the redemption value by approximately $54 million or $27 million, respectively.\nRECENT\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 1 –\nAccounting Policies\nto our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards. We do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods.\n70\nTable of Contents"

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/\nERNST & YOUNG LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 8, 2024\n75\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n76\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n77\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n78\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n79\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\n1\nExcludes $\n241\nmillion, $\n249\nmillion and $\n215\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n80\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.\nAccounting Policies\nNature of operations\nS&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity and automotive markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms and issuers; the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, petrochemicals, metals & steel and agriculture; and the automotive markets include manufacturers, suppliers, dealerships, service shops and consumers.\nOur operations consist of\nsix\nreportable segments: S&P Global Market Intelligence (“Market Intelligence”), S&P Global Ratings (“Ratings”), S&P Global Commodity Insights (“Commodity Insights”), S&P Global Mobility (“Mobility”), S&P Dow Jones Indices (“Indices”) and S&P Global Engineering Solutions (“Engineering Solutions”).\n•\nMarket Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions.\n•\nRatings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.\n•\nCommodity Insights is a leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.\n•\nMobility is a leading provider of solutions serving the full automotive value chain including vehicle manufacturers (OEMs), automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies.\n•\nIndices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.\n•\nAs of May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of Engineering Solutions, a provider of engineering standards and related technical knowledge, and the results are included through that date.\nOn May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of Engineering Solutions to Allium Buyer LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”). We received the full proceeds from the sale of $\n975\nmillion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, which we expect to result in approximately $\n750\nmillion in after-tax proceeds. The assets and liabilities of Engineering Solutions were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $\n120\nmillion in Loss (gain) on dispositions and disposition-related costs of $\n16\nmillion in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income ($\n182\nmillion after-tax, net of a release of a deferred tax liability of $\n157\nmillion) related to the sale of Engineering Solutions. The transaction followed our announced intent in November of 2022 to divest the business. Engineering Solutions became part of the Company following our merger with IHS Markit.\nOn February 28, 2022, we completed the merger with IHS Markit Ltd (“IHS Markit”), and as a result, IHS Markit and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of S&P Global, and the financial results include IHS Markit from the date of acquisition.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnder ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nSubscription revenue\nSubscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily derived from distribution of data, valuation services, analytics, third party research, and credit ratings-related information through both feed and web-based channels. Subscription revenue at Market Intelligence also includes software and hosted product offerings which provide maintenance and continuous access to our platforms over the contract term. Subscription revenue at Commodity Insights is primarily from subscriptions to our market data and market insights (price assessments, market reports and commentary and analytics) along with other information products and software term licenses. Subscription revenue at Mobility is primarily derived from products that provide data and insight on future vehicles sales and production, including detailed forecasts on technology and vehicle components; supply car\n81\nTable of Contents\nmakers and dealers with market reporting products, predictive analytics and marketing automation software; and support dealers with vehicle history reports, used car listings and service retention solutions. Subscription revenue at Mobility also include a range of services to financial institutions, to support their marketing, insurance underwriting and claims management activities. Subscription revenue at Indices is derived from the contracts for underlying data of our indexes to support our customers' management of index funds, portfolio analytics, and research. Subscription revenue at Engineering Solutions was primarily from subscriptions to our Product Design offerings providing standards, codes and specifications; applied technical reference; engineering journals, reports, best practices, and other vetted technical reference; and patents and patent applications.\nFor subscription products and services, we generally provide continuous access to dynamic data sets and analytics for a defined period, with revenue recognized ratably as our performance obligation to provide access to our data and analytics is progressively fulfilled over the stated term of the contract.\nNon-transaction revenue\nNon-transaction revenue at Ratings primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment revenue elimination of $\n177\nmillion, $\n169\nmillion and $\n146\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, mainly consisting of the royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.\nFor non-transaction revenue related to Rating’s surveillance services, we continuously monitor factors that impact the creditworthiness of an issuer over the contractual term with revenue recognized to the extent that our performance obligation is progressively fulfilled over the term contract. Because surveillance services are continuously provided throughout the term of the contract, our measure of progress towards fulfillment of our obligation to monitor a rating is a time-based output measure with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract.\nNon-subscription / Transaction revenue\nTransaction revenue at our Ratings segment primarily includes fees associated with:\n•\nratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments; as well as structured finance instruments; and\n•\nbank loan ratings.\nTransaction revenue is recognized at the point in time when our performance obligation is satisfied by issuing a rating on our customer's instruments and when we have a right to payment and the customer can benefit from the significant risks and rewards of ownership.\nNon-subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily related to certain advisory, pricing conferences and events, and analytical services. Non-subscription revenue at Mobility include one-time transactional sales of data that are non-cyclical in nature — and that are usually tied to underlying business metrics such as vehicle manufacturers marketing spend or safety recall activity — as well as consulting and advisory services. Non-subscription revenue at Commodity Insights is primarily related to conference sponsorship, consulting engagements, events, and perpetual software licenses. Non-subscription revenue at Engineering Solutions was primarily from retail transaction and consulting services.\nAsset-linked fees\nAsset-linked fees at Indices are primarily related to royalties payments based on the value of assets under management in our customers exchange-traded funds and mutual funds.\nFor asset-linked products and services, we provide licenses conveying continuous access to our index and benchmark-related intellectual property during a specified contract term. Revenue is recognized when the extent that our customers have used our licensed intellectual property can be quantified. Recognition of revenue for our asset-linked fee arrangements is subject to the \"recognition constraint\" for usage-based royalty payments because we cannot reasonably predict the value of the assets that will be invested in index funds structured using our intellectual property until it is either publicly available or when we are notified by our customers. Revenue derived from an asset-linked fee arrangement is measured and recognized when the certainty of the extent of its utilization of our index products by our customers is known.\n82\nTable of Contents\nSales usage-based royalties\nSales usage-based royalty revenue at our Indices segment is primarily related to trading based fees from exchange-traded derivatives. Sales and usage-based royalty revenue at our Commodity Insights segment is primarily related to licensing of its proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges.\nFor sales usage-based royalty products and services, we provide licenses conveying the right to continuous access to our intellectual property over the contract term, with revenue recognized when the extent of our license’s utilization can be quantified, or more specifically, when trading volumes are known and publicly available to us or when we are notified by our customers. Recognition of revenue of fees tied to trading volumes is subject to the recognition constraint for a usage-based royalty promised by our customers in exchange for the license of our intellectual property, with revenue recognized when trading volumes are known.\nRecurring variable revenue\nRecurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence represents revenue from contracts for services that specify a fee based on, among other factors, the number of trades processed, assets under management, or the number of positions valued.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. Revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one performance obligation is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned. The fair value of the service components are determined using an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately. If the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable, we make our best estimate of the services’ stand-alone selling price and record revenue as it is earned over the service period.\nReceivables\nWe record a receivable when a customer is billed or when revenue is recognized prior to billing a customer. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual period.\nContract Assets\nContract assets include unbilled amounts from when the Company transfers service to a customer before a customer pays consideration or before payment is due. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, contract assets were $\n75\nmillion and $\n60\nmillion, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets.\nUnearned Revenue\nWe record unearned revenue when cash payments are received in advance of our performance. The increase in the unearned revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily driven by cash payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $\n2.8\nbillion of revenues recognized that were included in the unearned revenue balance at the beginning of the period.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of contracts for work that has not yet been performed. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $\n4.5\nbillion. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately fifty-five percent and eighty-five percent of the remaining performance obligations over the next\n12\nand\n24\nmonths, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nWe do not disclose the value of unfulfilled performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts where revenue is a usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that the costs associated with certain sales commission programs are incremental to the costs to obtain contracts with customers and therefore meet the criteria to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $\n234\nmillion and $\n175\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The capitalized asset will be amortized over a period consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, calculated based on the customer term and the average life of the products and services underlying the contracts which has been\n83\nTable of Contents\ndetermined to be approximately\n5\nyears. The expense is recorded within selling and general expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling and general expenses.\nEquity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nThe Company holds an investment in a\n50\n/\n50\njoint venture arrangement with shared control with CME Group that combined each of the company’s post-trade services into a new joint venture, OSTTRA. The joint venture provides trade processing and risk mitigation operations and incorporates CME Group’s optimization businesses (Traiana, TriOptima, and Reset) and the Company’s MarkitSERV business. The combination is intended to increase operating efficiencies of both the company’s business to more effectively service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity, and credit asset classes. Our share of earnings or losses are recognized in Equity in income on unconsolidated subsidiaries in our consolidated statements of income.\nOther Expense (Income), net\nThe components of other expense (income), net for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nWe classify a disposal group to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal group; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nA disposal group that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale.\nThe fair value of a disposal group less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any subsequent changes are reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group as held for sale in the current period in our consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn determining whether a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be presented as a discontinued operation, we make a determination whether the disposal represents a strategic shift that had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results. A component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished both operationally and for financial reporting purposes. If we conclude that the disposal represents a strategic shift, then the results of operations of the group of assets being disposed of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are aggregated for separate presentation apart from our continuing operating results in the consolidated financial statements.\n84\nTable of Contents\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and our share of earnings or losses of joint ventures and affiliated companies under the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company applies the guidelines set forth in Topic 810 of the ASC in assessing its interests in variable interest entities to decide whether to consolidate an entity. The Company has reviewed the potential variable interest entities and determined that there are no consolidation requirements under Topic 810 of the ASC.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include ordinary bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that consist primarily of money market funds with unrestricted daily liquidity and fixed term time deposits. Such investments and bank deposits are stated at cost, which approximates market value, and were $\n1.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. These investments are not subject to significant market risk.\nRestricted cash\nCash that is subject to legal restrictions or is unavailable for general operating purposes is classified as restricted cash.\nRestricted cash included in our consolidated balance sheets was $\n1\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nShort-term investments\nShort-term investments are securities with original maturities greater than 90 days that are available for use in our operations in the next twelve months. The short-term investments, primarily consisting of certificates of deposit and mutual funds, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value, which is estimated based on the net asset value of these investments. Interest and dividends are recorded in income when earned.\nAccounts receivable\nCredit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition. Accounts receivable, which include billings consistent with terms of contractual arrangements, are recorded at net realizable value.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions, and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators.\nCapitalized technology costs\nWe capitalize certain software development and website implementation costs. Capitalized costs only include incremental, direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop the software after the preliminary project stage is completed, funding has been committed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Incremental costs are expenditures that are out-of-pocket to us and are not part of an allocation or existing expense base. Software development and website implementation costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs are amortized from the year the software is ready for its intended use over its estimated useful life,\nthree\nto\nseven years\n, using the straight-line method. Periodically, we evaluate the amortization methods, remaining lives and recoverability of such costs. Capitalized software development and website implementation costs are included in other non-current assets and are presented net of accumulated amortization.\nGross capitalized technology costs were $\n303\nmillion and $\n259\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized technology costs was $\n194\nmillion and $\n190\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFair Value\nCertain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value and classified within a fair value hierarchy based on inputs used when measuring fair value. We have foreign exchange forward contracts, cross currency and interest rate swaps that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis.\nOther financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity and highly liquid nature of these instruments.\nThe fair value of our\n85\nTable of Contents\nlong-term debt borrowings were $\n10.3\nbillion and $\n9.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.\nAccounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management’s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.\nLeases\nWe determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement.  We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of\n1\nyear to\n10\nyears, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to\n15\nyears, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within\n1\nyear. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of use (\"ROU\") assets and associated lease liabilities. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses.\nOperating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have\nfive\nreporting units with goodwill that are evaluated for impairment.\nWe initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. If, based on our evaluation we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts we perform a quantitative impairment test.\nWhen conducting our impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. Fair value of the reporting units are estimated using the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted free cash flow (“DCF”) analyses and are corroborated using the market approach, which incorporates the use of revenue and earnings multiples based on market data. The DCF analyses are based on the current operating budgets and estimated long-term growth projections for each reporting unit. Future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit, adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate. In addition, we analyze any difference between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness, taking into account certain factors including control premiums. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach to\n86\nTable of Contents\nestimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nSignificant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.\nWe performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that\nno\nimpairment existed for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nEquity Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nEquity investments for which we exercise significant influence, but do not have control over the investee, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option or there is a readily determinable fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are included in other expense (income), net. Equity investments for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded in other expense (income), net. Our equity investments are included in Equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of earnings or losses are recognized in other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of income. We periodically evaluate all our equity investments for impairment.\nThe OSTTRA joint venture is accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and our share of earnings or losses are recognized in Equity in income on unconsolidated subsidiaries in our consolidated statements of income.\nForeign currency translation\nWe have operations in many foreign countries. For most international operations, the local currency is the functional currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the United States (\n“U.S.”\n) dollar is the functional currency. For local currency operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of equity.\nDepreciation\nThe costs of property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based upon the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements from\n15\nto\n40\nyears and equipment and furniture from\n2\nto\n10\nyears. The costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases.\nAdvertising expense\nThe cost of advertising is expensed as incurred.\nWe incurred $\n209\nmillion, $\n177\nmillion and $\n39\nmillion in advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.\nJudgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.\n87\nTable of Contents\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2024. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have approximately $\n7.1\nbillion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $\n4.3\nbillion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nThe agreement with the minority partners of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by our minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Since redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control, this interest is presented on our consolidated balance sheets under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interest.” If the interest were to be redeemed, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and  market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches incorporate Level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income.\nSee Note 9 –\nEquity\nfor further detail.\nContingencies\nWe accrue for loss contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record our best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn December of 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting guidance that expands disclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The guidance is effective for for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company’s disclosures.\nIn November of 2023, the FASB issued accounting guidance that expands reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company’s disclosures.\nIn March of 2023, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires all entities to amortize leasehold improvements associated with common control leases over the useful life to the common control group. The guidance was effective on January 1, 2024 and the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March of 2020, the FASB issued accounting guidance to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current contract modifications and hedge accounting guidance in light of the expected market transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to alternative rates. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The transactions primarily include (1) contract modifications, (2) hedging\n88\nTable of Contents\nrelationships, and (3) sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. In December of 2022, the FASB amended its guidance to defer the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may elect to adopt the amendments prospectively to transactions existing as of or entered into from the date of adoption through December 31, 2024. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nReclassification\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparability purposes.\n2.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions\n2023\nAcquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2023 included:\n•\nOn February 16, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Market Scan Information Systems, Inc. (“Market Scan”), a leading provider of automotive pricing and incentive intelligence, including Automotive Payments as a Service and its powerful payment calculation engine. The addition of Market Scan to Mobility enabled the integration of detailed transaction intelligence in areas that are complementary to existing services for dealers, OEMs, lenders, and other market participants. The acquisition of Market Scan is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\n•\nOn January 3, 2023, we completed the acquisition of ChartIQ, a premier charting provider for the financial services industry. ChartIQ is a professional grade charting solution that allows users to visualize data with a fully interactive web-based library that works seamlessly across web, mobile and desktop. It provides advanced capabilities including trade visualization, options analytics, technical analysis and more. Additionally, ChartIQ allows clients to visualize vendor-supplied data combined with their own proprietary content, alternative datasets or analytics. The acquisition is part of our Market Intelligence segment and further enhances our S&P Capital IQ Pro platform and other workflow solutions to provide the industry with leading visualization capabilities. The acquisition of ChartIQ is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\n•\nOn January 4, 2023, we completed the acquisition of TruSight Solutions LLC (“TruSight”) a provider of third-party vendor risk assessments. The acquisition was integrated into our Market Intelligence segment and further expanded the breadth and depth of S&P Global’s third party vendor risk management solutions by offering high-quality validated assessment data to clients designed to reduce further the vendor due diligence burden on service providers to the financial services industry. The acquisition of TruSight is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nNone of our acquisitions completed during 2023 were material individually or in the aggregate, including the pro forma impact on earnings. For acquisitions during 2023 that were accounted for using the purchase method, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. The goodwill recognized on our acquisitions is largely attributable to anticipated operational synergies and growth opportunities as a result of the acquisition. The intangible assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are being amortized over their anticipated use\nful\nlives of\n5\n-\n7\nyears.\n2022\nOn December 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the Shades of Green business from the Center for International Climate Research (“CICERO”), Norway's foremost institute for interdisciplinary climate research. The acquisition was integrated into S&P Global Ratings and further expanded the breadth and depth of its second party opinions (SPOs) offering. SPOs are independent assessments of a company's financing or framework's alignment with market standards and typically provided before any borrowing is raised. The acquisition of the Shades of Green business is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\n89\nTable of Contents\nMerger with IHS Markit\nOn February 28, 2022, we completed the merger with IHS Markit by acquiring\n100\n% of the IHS Markit common stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition, and as a result, IHS Markit and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of S&P Global. Upon completion of the merger with IHS Markit, IHS Markit stockholders received\n113.8\nmillion shares of S&P Global’s common stock, at an exchange ratio of\n0.2838\nS&P Global shares for each share of IHS Markit common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The Company also issued approximately\n0.9\nmillion replacement equity award shares for IHS Markit equity awards that were assumed pursuant to the merger agreement.\nThe fair value of the consideration transferred for IHS Markit was approximately $\n43.5\nbillion as of the merger date, which consisted of the following:\n*Excludes\n25,219,470\nIHS Markit shares held by the Markit Group Holdings Limited Employee Benefit Trust (\n“\nEBT\n”\n). The shares held by the EBT were converted in the merger into S&P Global shares at the exchange ratio of\n0.2838\nand will continue to be held by the trustee in the EBT.\n**Based on S&P Global's closing stock price on February 25, 2022\n.\nAllocation of Purchase Price\nThe merger with IHS Markit was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, of which $\n699\nmillion is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributed to synergies from future expected economic benefits, including enhanced revenue growth from expanded capabilities and geographic presence as well as substantial cost savings from duplicative overhead, streamlined op\nerations and enhanced operational efficiency.\nThe allocation of purchase price recorded for IHS Markit is as follows:\n90\nTable of Contents\nAcquired Identifiable Intangible Assets\nThe following table sets forth the fair values of the components of the identifiable intangible assets acquired and their useful lives:\nAcquisition-Related Expenses\nThe Company incurred acquisition-related costs of $\n236\nmillion related to the IHS Markit merger for the year ended December 31, 2023, $\n619\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $\n249\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. These costs were included in selling and general expenses within the Company’s consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPro forma information\n91\nTable of Contents\nSince the acquisition date, the results of operations for IHS Markit of $\n3.799\nbillion of revenue and $\n659\nmillion of operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2022, have been included within the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nThe following unaudited supplemental pro forma combined financial information presents the\nCompany’s results of operations for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nand\nDecember 31, 2021\nas if the acquisition of IHS Markit had occurred on January 1, 2021. The pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the Company’s operating results that may have actually occurred had the acquisition of IHS Markit been completed on January 1, 2021.\nThe pro forma results do not include anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acquisition.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information reflects pro forma adjustments to present the combined pro forma results of operations as if the acquisition had occurre\nd on January 1, 2021 to give effect to certain events the Company believes to be directly attributable to the acquisition.\n2021\nAcquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2021 included:\n•\nIn\nDecember of 2021, as part of our Sustainable1 investments, we completed the acquisition of The Climate Service, Inc. (“TCS\n”\n), which has developed a climate risk analytics platform assisting corporates, investors and governments with assessing physical climate risks. Sustainable1 is S&P Global's single source of essential sustainability intelligence, bringing together S&P Global's resources and full product suite of data, benchmarking, analytics, evaluations and indices that provide customers with a 360-degree view to help achieve their sustainability goals. The acquisition added capabilities to S&P Global's leading portfolio of essential\nenvironmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) insights and solutions for its customers. Through this acquisition, S&P Global is able to offer its clients even more transparent, robust and comprehensive climate data, models and analytics. We accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition of The Climate Service, Inc. is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nNone of our acquisitions completed during 2021 were material individually or in the aggregate, including the pro forma impact on earnings. For acquisitions during 2021 that were accounted for using the purchase method, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. The goodwill recognized on our acquisitions is largely attributable to anticipated operational synergies and growth opportunities as a result of the acquisition. The intangible assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are being amortized over their anticipated useful lives of\n7\nyears.\nNon-cash investing activities\nLiabilities assumed in conjunction with our acquisitions are as follows:\nDivestitures\n2023\n92\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed\nthe following disposition and received the following contingent payment\nthat resulted in a pre-tax loss of $\n70\nmillion, which was included in Loss (gain) on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income:\n•\nOn May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of Engineering Solutions to Allium Buyer LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”). We received the full proceeds from the sale of $\n975\nmillion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, which we expect to result in approximately $\n750\nmillion in after-tax proceeds. The assets and liabilities of Engineering Solutions were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwe recorded a pre-tax loss of $\n120\nmillion in Loss (gain) on dispositions and disposition-related costs of $\n16\nmillion in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income ($\n182\nmillion after-tax, net of a release of a deferred tax liability of $\n157\nmillion)\nrelated to the sale of Engineering Solutions. The transaction followed our announced intent in November of 2022 to divest the business. Engineering Solutions became part of the Company following our merger with IHS Markit.\n•\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we received a contingent payment following the sale of Leveraged Commentary and Data (“LCD”) along with a related family of leveraged loan indices in June of 2022. The contingent payment was payable\nsix months\nfollowing the closing upon the achievement of certain conditions related to the transition of LCD customer relationships. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the contingent payment resulted in a pre-tax gain of $\n46\nmillion ($\n34\nmillion after-tax) related to the sale of LCD in our Market Intelligence segment and $\n4\nmillion ($\n3\nmillion after-tax) in Loss (gain) on dispositions related to the sale of a family of leveraged loan indices in our Indices segment.\n2022\nAs a condition of securing regulatory approval for the merger, S&P Global and IHS Markit agreed to divest of certain of their businesses.

We have indefinite-lived assets with a carrying value of  $\n846\nmillion  as of  December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n•\n2023 and 2022 both include $\n380\nmillion and $\n90\nmillion for Dow Jones Indices intellectual property and the Dow Jones tradename, respectively, that we recorded as part of the transaction to form S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC in 2012.\n•\n2023 and 2022 both include $\n185\nmillion within our Market Intelligence segment for the SNL tradename.\n•\n2023 and 2022 both include $\n132\nmillion within our Indices segment for the balance of the IP rights in a family of indices derived from the S&P 500, solidifying Indices IP in and to the S&P 500 index family.\n•\n2023 and 2022 both include $\n59\nmillion within our Indices segment for the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index intellectual property and the Broad Market Indices intellectual property.\nThe following table summarizes our definite-lived intangible assets:\n1\nRelates to Engineering Solutions, which is classified as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\n2\nPrimarily relates to the impact of foreign exchange and valuation adjustments for prior period acquisitions.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to\n25\nyears. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets as of December 31, 2023 is approximately\n22\nyears.\n95\nTable of Contents\nAmortization expense was $\n1,042\nmillion, $\n905\nmillion and $\n96\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nExpected amortization expense for intangible assets over the next five years for the years ended December 31, assuming no further acquisitions or dispositions, is as follows:\n4.\nTaxes on Income\nIncome before taxes on income resulting from domestic and foreign operations is as follows:\nThe provision for taxes on income consists of the following:\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes is as follows:\nFluctuation in tax rates by year is primarily due to tax charge on merger related divestitures and change in mix of income by jurisdiction.\n96\nTable of Contents\nWe have elected to recognize the tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) as a period expense in the year the tax is incurred. GILTI expense is included in Other, net above.\nThe principal temporary differences between the accounting for income and expenses for financial reporting and income tax purposes are as follows:\nWe record valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that such deferred income tax assets will not be realized based upon all the available evidence. The valuation allowance is primarily related to operating losses.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have approximately\n$\n7.1\nbillion\nof undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which\n$\n4.3\nbillion\nis reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations. We have not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable.\nWe made net income tax payments tot\naling $\n1,279\nmillion in 2023, $\n1,555\nmillion in 2022, and $\n883\nmillion in 2021. As of December 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $\n1,177\nmillion\n, of which a significant portion has an unlimited carryover period under current law.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nThe total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was\n$\n230\nmillion\n, $\n223\nmillion and $\n147\nmillion, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the change in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a net increase of tax expense of\n$\n5\nmillion\n.\n97\nTable of Contents\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the balance sheet may be reduced by up to approximately\n$\n12\nmillion\nin the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of local tax examinations and expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits, we had accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits of\n$\n50\nmillion\nand $\n38\nmillion as of  December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe U.S. federal income tax audits for 2018 through 2023 are in process. During 2023, we completed state and foreign tax audits and, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2015. Th\ne impact to tax expense in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was not material.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2024. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.\nFor tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development costs pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 174. Section 174 requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development costs and amortize them over 5 years for expenditures attributed to domestic research and 15 years for expenditures attributed to foreign research. This provision affected a significant proportion of the Company for the first time in 2023. During 2023, our cash taxes were adversely impacted by the requirement to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses under Section 174. Although Congress is considering legislation that would reinstate and extend Section 174 expensing for certain research and experimental expenditures, the possibility that this will happen is uncertain.\n98\nTable of Contents\n5.\nDebt\nA summary of short-term and long-term debt outstanding is as follows:\n1\nWe made a $\n38\nmillion payment on the retirement of our\n4.125\n% senior notes in the third quarter of 2023.\n2\nInterest payments are due semiannually on May 1 and November 1.\n3\nInterest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15.\n4\nInterest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1.\n5\nInterest payments are due semiannually on January 22 and July 22, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n3\nmillion.\n6\nInterest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1, beginning on September 30, 2022, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n10\nmillion.\n7\nInterest payments are due semiannually on February 1 and August 1.\n8\nInterest payments are due semiannually on May 1 and November 1.\n9\nInterest payments are due semiannually on June 1 and December 1, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n3\nmillion.\n10\nInterest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1, beginning on September 1, 2022, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n14\nmillion.\n11\nInterest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n5\nmillion.\n12\nInterest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1, beginning on September 1, 2022, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n26\nmillion.\n13\nInterest payments are due semiannually on March 15 and September 15, beginning on March 15, 2024, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n7\nmillion.\n99\nTable of Contents\n14\nInterest payments are due semiannually on May 15 and November 15, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n2\nmillion.\n15\nInterest payments are due semiannually on May 15 and November 15, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n11\nmillion.\n16\nInterest payments are due semiannually on June 1 and December 1, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n10\nmillion.\n17\nInterest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1, beginning on September 1, 2022, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n25\nmillion.\n18\nInterest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n17\nmillion.\n19\nInterest payments are due semiannually on March 1 and September 1, beginning on September 1, 2022, and as of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n14\nmillion.\nAnnual long-term debt maturities are scheduled as follows based on book values as of December 31, 2023: $\n47\nmillion due in 2024, $\n4\nmillion due in 2025, $\n3\nmillion due in 2026; $\n1.7\nbillion due in 2027; $\n810\nmillion due in 2028; and $\n8.9\nbillion due thereafter.\nThe fair value of our total debt borrowings was $\n10.3\nbillion\nand $\n9.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.\nOn September 12, 2023, we issued $\n750\nmillion of\n5.25\n% senior notes due in 2033. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company used the net proceeds to repay its outstanding commercial paper borrowings.\nOn February 28, 2022, we completed the merger with IHS Markit in an all-stock transaction. In the transaction, we assumed IHS Markit’s publicly traded debt, with an outstanding principal balance of $\n4.6\nbillion, which was recorded at fair value of $\n4.9\nbillion on the acquisition date.  Debt assumed consisted of the following:\n•\n5.00\n% Senior Notes due November 1, 2022 with an outstanding principal balance of $\n748\nmillion.\n•\n4.125\n% Senior Notes due August 1, 2023 with an outstanding principal balance of $\n500\nmillion.\n•\n3.625\n% Senior Notes due May 1, 2024 with an outstanding principal balance of $\n400\nmillion.\n•\n4.75\n% Senior Notes due February 15, 2025 with an outstanding principal balance of $\n800\nmillion.\n•\n4.00\n% Senior Notes due March 1, 2026 with an outstanding principal balance of $\n500\nmillion.\n•\n4.75\n% Senior Notes due August 1, 2028 with an outstanding principal balance of $\n750\nmillion.\n•\n4.25\n% Senior Notes due May 1, 2029 with an outstanding principal balance of $\n950\nmillion.\nThe adjustment to fair value of these Senior Notes of approximately $\n292\nmillion on the acquisition date is being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining contractual terms of the Senior Notes.\nOn March 2, 2022, we completed the offer (the “Exchange Offer”) to exchange outstanding notes issued by IHS Markit for new notes issued by us and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity date and redemption terms as each corresponding series of exchange IHS Markit notes and cash. Of the approximately $\n4.6\nbillion in aggregate principal amount of IHS Markit’s Senior Notes offered in the exchange,\n96\n%, or approximately $\n4.5\nbillion, were tendered and accepted. The portion not exchanged, approximately $\n175\nmillion, remained outstanding across\nseven\nseries of Senior Notes issued by IHS Markit. The Exchange Offer was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes resulting in a portion of the unamortized fair value adjustment of the IHS Markit Senior Notes allocated to the new debt issued by S&P Global on the settlement date of the exchange. See Note 2\n—\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nfor additional information on the merger.\nOn March 18, 2022, we issued $\n1,250\nmillion of\n2.45\n% Senior Notes due 2027, $\n1,250\nmillion of\n2.7\n% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2029, $\n1,500\nmillion of\n2.9\n% Senior Notes due 2032, $\n1,000\nmillion of\n3.7\n% Senior Notes due 2052, and $\n500\nmillion of\n3.9\n% Senior Notes due 2062. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC. In the first quarter of 2022, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the new debt issuance to fund the redemption and extinguishment of the outstanding principal amount of our\n4.125\n% Senior\n100\nTable of Contents\nNotes due 2023,\n3.625\n% Senior Notes due 2024, and our\n4.0\n% Senior Notes due 2026 which were former IHS Markit Notes that were exchanged to SPGI Notes as part of the Exchange Offer. In addition, we also used part of the net proceeds from the new debt issuance noted above to fund the early tender as well as a subsequent full redemption of our\n5.0\n% Senior Notes due 2022 and the\n4.750\n% Senior Notes due 2025, both of which were former IHS Markit Notes that were exchanged to SPGI Notes as part of the Exchange Offer, as well as our\n4.0\n% Senior Notes due 2025. The majority of these transactions settled within the first quarter of 2022, however, given the timing of certain redemptions, a lesser portion of these settled in the second quarter of 2022, including the redemption and extinguishment of the $\n287\nmillion outstanding principal amount on our\n4.0\n% senior notes due in 2025, and a portion of the outstanding principal amounts of our\n5.0\n% senior notes due in 2022 and our\n4.75\n% senior notes due in 2025, of approximately $\n52\nmillion and $\n247\nmillion, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a\nn $\n8\nmillion lo\nss on extinguishment of debt. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes a $\n142\nmillion tender premium paid to tendering note holders in accordance with the terms of the tender offer, partially offset by a $\n134\nmillion non-cash write-off related to the fair market value step up premium on extinguished debt.\nWe have the ability to borrow a total of $\n2.0\nbillion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $\n2.0\nbillion\nfive-year\ncredit agreement (our “credit facility”) that will terminate on April 26, 2026. As of December 31, 2023, we had\nno\noutstanding commercial paper. As of December 31, 2022, there was $\n188\nmillion of commercial paper outstanding.\nCommitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of\n8\nbasis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.\nThe only financial covenant required under our credit facility is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than\n4\nto 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.\n6.\nDerivative Instruments\nOur exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and held cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we held a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing. These contracts are recorded at fair value that is based on foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivative contracts within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nUndesignated Derivative Instruments\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate notional value of these outstanding forward contracts was $\n2.6\nbillion and $\n1.8\nbillion, respectively. The changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in prepaid and other assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The amount recorded in prepaid and other current assets was $\n69\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount recorded in other current liabilities was $\n1\nmillion and $\n37\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount recorded in selling and general expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 related to these contracts was a net gain $\n81\nmillion, a net loss of $\n45\nmillion and a net gain of $\n9\nmillion, respectively.\n101\nTable of Contents\nNet Investment Hedges\nAs of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we held cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in one of our European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. These swaps are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and are scheduled to mature in 2024, 2029 and 2030. The notional value of our outstanding cross currency swaps designated as a net investment hedge was $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in the fair value of these swaps are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of other comprehensive income (loss), and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges based on changes in spot exchange rates. Accordingly, amounts related to the cross currency swaps recognized directly in net income represent net periodic interest settlements and accruals, which are recognized in interest expense, net. We recognized net interest income of $\n25\nmillion, net interest expense of $\n31\nmillion and net interest income of $\n20\nmillion during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCash Flow Hedges\nForeign Exchange Forward Contracts\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Indian rupee, British pound, and Euro exposures through the fourth quarter of 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These contracts are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future revenue and operating costs and are scheduled to mature within\ntwenty-four months\n. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into revenue and selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we estimate that $\n7\nmillion of pre-tax gain related to foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.\nThe aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $\n529\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nAs of  December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we held positions in a series of interest rate swaps. These contracts are intended to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing and are scheduled to mature beginning in the first quarter of 2027. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and will be subsequently reclassified into interest expense, net in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was $\n813\nmillion and $\n1.4\nbillion, respectively, with the current period reduction attributable to the issuance of $\n750\nmillion\n5.25\n% senior notes in September of 2023.\n102\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides information on the location and fair value amounts of our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nThe following table provides information on the location and amounts of pre-tax gains (losses) on our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the years ended December 31:\n103\nTable of Contents\nThe activity related to the change in unrealized gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows for the years ended December 31:\n7.\nEmployee Benefits\nWe maintain a number of active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees. The majority of our defined benefit plans are frozen. As a result, no new employees will be permitted to enter these plans and no additional benefits for current participants in the frozen plans will be accrued.\nWe also have supplemental benefit plans that provide senior management with supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor a voluntary 401(k) plan under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees’ compensation to the employees’ accounts.\nWe also provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits for active employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans and supplemental life insurance plan are contributory, while the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans.\nWe recognize the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.\nNet periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans other than the service cost component are included in other income, net in our consolidated statements of income.\n104\nTable of Contents\nBenefit Obligation\nA summary of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, as well as the funded status for the retirement and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (benefits paid in the table below include only those amounts contributed directly to or paid directly from plan assets):\n1\nRelates to the impact of lump sum benefit payments to terminated vested participants to settle existing pension obligations owed under the plan. The non-cash pretax settlement charge reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nFor purposes of determining annual pension cost, prior service costs are being amortized straight-line over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants expected to receive benefits.\n105\nTable of Contents\nA summary of net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans for the years ended December 31, is as follows:\n1\nLump sum withdrawals exceeded the combined total anticipated annual service and interest cost of our U.S. retirement plan during the year ended December 31, 2023 and U.K. plan during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, triggering the recognition of non-cash pre-tax settlement charges of $\n23\nmillion, $\n13\nmillion and  $\n3\nmillion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOur U.K. retirement plan accounted for a cost of $\n4\nmillion in 2023 and a benefit of  $\n6\nmillion and $\n22\nmillion in 2022 and 2021, respectively, of the net periodic benefit cost attributable to the funded plans.\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax for the years ended   December 31, are as follows:\n1\nLump sum withdrawals exceeded the combined total anticipated annual service and interest cost of our U.S. retirement plan during the year ended December 31, 2023 and U.K. plan during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, triggering the recognition of non-cash pre-tax settlement charges of $\n23\nmillion, $\n13\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe total cost for our retirement plans was $\n170\nmillion for 2023, $\n124\nmillion for 2022 and $\n93\nmillion for 2021. Included in the total retirement plans cost are defined contribution plans cost of $\n120\nmillion, $\n88\nmillion and $\n86\nmillion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAssumptions\n1\nEffective January 1, 2023, we changed our discount rate assumption on our U.S. retirement plans to\n5.63\n% from\n3.05\n% in 2022 and changed our discount rate assumption on our U.K. plan to\n4.76\n% from\n1.87\n% in 2022.\n106\nTable of Contents\n2\nThe expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term. Effective January 1, 2023, our return on assets assumptions for the U.S. retirement plans and U.K plan remained unchanged at\n6.00\n% and\n5.50\n%, respectively.\nCash Flows\nExpected employer contributions in 2024 are $\n11\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. In 2024, we may elect to make non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status.\nInformation about the expected cash flows for our retirement and postretirement plans is as follows:\n1\nReflects the total benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants’ share of the cost.\n2\nReflects the total benefits expected to be paid from our assets.\nFair Value of Plan Assets\nIn accordance with authoritative guidance for fair value measurements certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe fair value of our defined benefit plans assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, by asset class is as follows:\n107\nTable of Contents\n1\nIncludes securities that are mainly investment grade obligations of issuers in the U.S.\n2\nIncludes a fund which holds real estate properties in the U.K.\n3\n2023 and 2022 includes the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index, the Standard & Poor’s MidCap 400 Composite Stock Index, a short-term investment fund which is a common collective trust vehicle, and other various asset classes. Additionally, 2023 includes the Standard & Poor’s MidCap 600 Composite Stock Index.\n4\nIncludes securities that are tracked in the S&P Smallcap 600 index.\n5\nIncludes funds that invest in global infrastructure for the U.K. Pension.\nFor securities that are quoted in active markets, the trustee/custodian determines fair value by applying securities’ prices obtained from its pricing vendors. For commingled funds that are not actively traded, the trustee applies pricing information provided by investment management firms to the unit quantities of such funds. Investment management firms employ their own pricing vendors to value the securities underlying each commingled fund. Underlying securities that are not actively traded derive their prices from investment managers, which in turn, employ vendors that use pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow, comparables). The domestic defined benefit plans have no investment in our stock, except through the S&P 500 commingled trust index fund.\nThe trustee obtains estimated prices from vendors for securities that are not easily quotable and they are categorized accordingly as Level 3.\nThe following table details further information on our plan assets where we have used significant unobservable inputs:\nPension Trusts’ Asset Allocations\nThere are\ntwo\npension trusts,\none\nin the U.S. and\none\nin the U.K.\n•\nThe U.S. pension trust had assets of $\n1,176\nmillion and $\n1,185\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, and the target allocations in 2023 include\n90\n% fixed income,\n5\n% domestic equities,\n3\n% international equities and\n2\n% cash and cash equivalents.\n•\nThe U.K. pension trust had assets of $\n297\nmillion and $\n279\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and the target allocations in 2023 include\n67\n% fixed income,\n16\n% equities,\n12\n% real estate and\n5\n% diversified growth funds.\n108\nTable of Contents\nThe pension assets are invested with the goal of producing a combination of capital growth, income and a liability hedge. The mix of assets is established after consideration of the long-term performance and risk characteristics of asset classes. Investments are selected based on their potential to enhance returns, preserve capital and reduce overall volatility. Holdings are diversified within each asset class. The portfolios employ a mix of index and actively managed equity strategies by market capitalization, style, geographic regions and economic sectors. The fixed income strategies include U.S. long duration securities, intermediate credit, high yield, and U.K. debt instruments. The short-term portfolio, whose primary goal is capital preservation for liquidity purposes, is composed of government and government-agency securities, uninvested cash, receivables and payables. The portfolios do not employ any financial leverage.\nU.S. Defined Contribution Plan\nAssets of the defined contribution plan in the U.S. consist primarily of investment options, which include actively managed equity, indexed equity, actively managed equity/bond funds, target date funds, S&P Global Inc. common stock, stable value and money market strategies. There is also a self-directed mutual fund investment option. The plan purchased\n146,600\nshares and sold\n179,569\nshares of S&P Global Inc. common stock in 2023 and purchased\n67,248\nshares and sold\n60,473\nshares of S&P Global Inc. common stock in 2022. The plan held approximately\n1.2\nmillion shares of S&P Global Inc. common stock as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with market values of $\n518\nmillion and $\n402\nmillion, respectively. The plan received dividends on S&P Global Inc. common stock of $\n4.5\nmillion and $\n4.0\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n8.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees under the 2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and to our eligible non-employee members of the Board of Directors under a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan.\nNo further awards may be granted under the 2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”), although awards granted under the 2002 Plan prior to the adoption of the new 2019 Plan in June of 2019 remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.\n•\n2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”)\n– The 2019 Plan permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance awards, and other stock-based awards.\n•\nDirector Deferred Stock Ownership Plan (the “Director Plan”)\n– Under the Director Plan, common stock reserved may be credited to deferred stock accounts for eligible non-employee members of the Board of Directors. In general, the plan requires that\n50\n% of eligible Directors’ annual compensation and dividend equivalents be credited to deferred stock accounts. Each Director may also elect to defer all or a portion of the remaining compensation and have an equivalent number of shares credited to their deferred stock account. Recipients under this plan are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service. Shares will be delivered as of the date a recipient ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors or within\nfive years\nthereafter, if so elected. The plan will remain in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors or until no shares of stock remain available under the plan.\n•\n2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan and the Amended and Restated IHS Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “IHS Markit’s equity plans”)\n– In connection with the merger with IHS Markit, we assumed the outstanding restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, deferred stock units, and stock options granted under IHS Markit’s equity plans, converted using the\n0.2838\nmerger exchange ratio. From the merger date, no additional awards under these plans may be granted; however, the outstanding awards that were converted at the merger date continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.\nThe number of common shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan are as follows:\n1\nShares reserved for issuance under the Director Plan are less than\n1.0\nmillion at both December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n109\nTable of Contents\nWe issue treasury shares upon exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted stock other stock-based awards. To offset the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans, we periodically repurchase shares. See Note 9 –\nEquity\nfor further discussion.\nStock-based compensation expense and the corresponding tax benefit are as follows:\nStock Options\nStock options may not be granted at a price less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted vest over a\nfour-year\nservice period and have a maximum term of\n10\nyears. Stock option compensation costs are recognized from the date of grant, utilizing a\nfour-year\ngraded vesting method. Under this method, more than half of the costs are recognized over the first\ntwelve months\n, approximately one-quarter of the costs are recognized over a\ntwenty-four month\nperiod starting from the date of grant, approximately one-tenth of the costs are recognized over a\nthirty-six month\nperiod starting from the date of grant, and the remaining costs are recognized over a\nforty-eight month\nperiod starting from the date of grant.\nThere were\nno\nstock options granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nStock option activity is as follows:\nInformation regarding our stock option exercises is as follows:\nRestricted Stock and Other Stock-Based Awards\nRestricted stock and other stock-based awards (performance and non-performance) have been granted under the 2002 Plan and 2019 Plan. Performance unit awards only vest if we achieve certain financial goals over the performance period. Restricted stock non-performance awards have various vesting periods (generally\nthree years\n). Recipients of restricted stock and unit awards are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service.\nThe stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and other stock-based awards is determined based on the market price of our stock at the grant date of the award applied to the total number of awards that are anticipated to fully vest. For performance awards, adjustments are made to expense consistent with the expected percent achievement of the performance goals.\n110\nTable of Contents\nRestricted stock and other stock-based award activity is as follows:\n9.\nEquity\nCapital Stock\nTwo\nmillion shares of preferred stock, par value $\n1\nper share, are authorized;\nnone\nhave been issued.\nOn January 23, 2024, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividends for 2024 to a quarterly common stock dividend of $\n0.91\nper share.\n1\nThe quarterly dividend rate was $\n0.90\nper share for the year ended December 31 2023.\nThe quarterly dividend rate was $\n0.77\nper share in the first quarter of 2022 and increased to $\n0.85\nper share beginning in the second quarter of 2022. The quarterly dividend rate was $\n0.77\nper share for the year ended December 31 2021.\nStock Repurchases\nOn June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of\n30\nmillion shares (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately\n9\n% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of\n30\nmillion shares (the “2020 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately\n12\n% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time.\nOur purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of December 31, 2023,\n18.7\nmillion shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program and the 2020 repurchase program was completed. Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.\nWe have entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution delivers additional shares. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR agreement based on the volume weighted-average share price, less a discount. We account for our ASR agreements as\ntwo\ntransactions: a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The shares delivered under\n111\nTable of Contents\nthe ASR agreements resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The repurchased shares are held in Treasury. The forward stock purchase contracts were classified as equity instruments.\nThe terms of each ASR agreement entered into for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, structured as outlined above, are as follows:\n1\nThe ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $\n1.3\nbillion and initially received shares valued at\n85\n% of the $\n1.3\nbillion at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on November 13, 2023 when the Company received an initial delivery of\n2.8\nmillion shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on February 7, 2024 and received an additional\n0.2\nmillion shares. We repurchased a total of\n3.0\nmillion shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price $\n428.45\n. per share. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program.\n2\nThe ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $\n500\nmillion and initially received shares valued at\n85\n% of the $\n500\nmillion at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on August 7, 2023 when the Company received an initial delivery of\n1.1\nmillion shares from the ASR program.

The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program.\n6\nThe ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $\n2.5\nbillion and initially received shares valued at\n87.5\n% of the $\n2.5\nbillion at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on August 9, 2022 when the Company received an initial delivery of\n5.8\nmillion shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on October 25, 2022 and received an additional\n1.6\nmillion shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 and 2020 Repurchase Program.\n7\nThe ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $\n1.5\nbillion and initially received shares valued at\n85\n% of the $\n1.5\nbillion at a share price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on May 13, 2022 when the Company received an initial delivery of\n3.8\nmillion shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on August 2, 2022 and received an additional\n0.6\nmillion shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2020 Repurchase Program.\n8\nThe ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $\n7\nbillion and initially received shares valued at\n85\n% of the $\n7\nbillion at a share equal to the then market price of the Company's common stock on March 1, 2022 when the company received an initial delivery of\n15.2\nmillion shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on August 9, 2022 and received an additional\n4.1\nmillion shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2020 Repurchase Program.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we purchased a total of\n8.6\nmillion shares for $\n3.3\nbillion of cash. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased a total of\n33.5\nmillion shares for $\n12.0\nbillion of cash. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did\nnot\nuse cash to purchase any shares.\n112\nTable of Contents\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nThe agreement with the minority partners that own\n27\n% of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Specifically, under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC (“CGIS”) has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least\n20\n% of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. In addition, in the event there is a change of control of the Company, for the\n15\ndays following a change in control, CME Group and CGIS will have the right to put their interest to us at the then fair value of CME Group’s and CGIS’ minority interest.\nIf interests were to be redeemed under this agreement, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. This interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interest” with an initial value based on fair value for the portion attributable to the net assets we acquired, and based on our historical cost for the portion attributable to our S&P Index business. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income.\nNoncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity.\nCh\nanges to redeemable noncontrolling interest during the year ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n1\nRelates to foreign currency translation adjustments\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2023:\n1\nIncludes an unrealized gain related to our cross currency swaps. See note 6 – Derivative Instruments for additional detail of items recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n2\nReflects amortization of net actuarial losses and is net of a tax provision of $\n1\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 7\n—\nEmployee Benefits\nfor additional details of items reclassed from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings.\n113\nTable of Contents\n3\nSee Note 6 –\nDerivative Instruments\nfor additional details of items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings.\n10.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS, except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of stock options and restricted performance shares calculated using the treasury stock method.\nThe calculation for basic and diluted EPS is as follows:\nWe have certain stock options and restricted performance shares that are potentially excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded when the average market price of our common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period or when a net loss exists because the effect would have been antidilutive. Additionally, restricted performance shares are excluded because the necessary vesting conditions had not been met or when a net loss exists. As of\nDecember 31, 2023\n, 2022 and 2021, there were\nno\nstock options excluded. Restricted performance shares outstandin\ng of\n0.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2023,\n0.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and\n0.5\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, respectively, were excl\nuded.\n11.\nRestructuring\nWe continuously evaluate our cost structure to identify cost savings associated with streamlining our management structure. Our 2023 and 2022 restructuring plans consisted of company-wide workforce reductions of approximately\n1,050\nand\n1,440\npositions, respectively, and are further detailed below. The charges for each restructuring plan are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income and the reserves are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income during the period when it is determined they are no longer needed.\n114\nTable of Contents\nThe initial restructuring charge recorded and the ending reserve balance as of December 31, 2023 by segment is as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $\n183\nmillion primarily related to employee severance charges for the 2023 restructuring plan and have reduced the reserve by $\n31\nmillion. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we have reduced the reserve for the 2022 restructuring plan by $\n262\nmillion. The reductions primarily related to cash payments for employee severance charges.\n12.\nSegment and Geographic Information\nAs discussed in Note 1 –\nAccounting Policies\n, we have\nsix\nreportable segments: Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility, Indices, and Engineering Solutions.\nOur Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision-maker and evaluates performance of our segments and allocates resources based primarily on operating profit. Segment operating profit does not include Corporate Unallocated expense, equity in income on unconsolidated subsidiaries, other expense (income), net, interest expense, net, or loss on extinguishment of debt as these are amounts that do not affect the operating results of our reportable segments.

See Note 2 –\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nfor further discussion.\nWe do not have operations in any foreign country that represent more than\n8\n% of our consolidated revenue. Transfers between geographic areas are recorded at agreed upon prices and intercompany revenue and profit are eliminated. No single customer accounted for more than\n10\n% of our consolidated revenue.\n119\nTable of Contents\nThe following provides revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region:\nSee Note 2 –\nAcquisitions and\nDivestitures\nand Note 11 –\nRestructuring\n, for actions that impacted the segment operating results.\n13.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLeases\nWe determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement.  We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of\n1\nyear to\n10\nyears, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to\n15\nyears, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within\n1\nyear. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses.\nOperating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The February 28, 2022 merger with IHS Markit resulted in an increase in ROU assets and operating lease liabilities of $\n230\nmillion and $\n268\nmillion, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n26\nmillion, $\n132\nmillion and $\n31\nmillion, respectively, related to the impairment and abandonment of operating lease related ROU assets. The pre-tax impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily associated with reductions in the anticipated sublease income on vacated leased facilities following the deterioration of local market conditions and consolidating our real estate facilities following the merger with IHS Markit. The impairment charges are included in selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income.\n120\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides information on the location and amounts of our leases on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThe components of lease expense for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\nSupplemental information related to leases for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases as of December 31 are as follows:\nMaturities of lease liabilities for our operating leases are as follows:\n121\nTable of Contents\nRelated Party Agreement\nIn June of 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with the holder of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC noncontrolling interest, CME Group, which replaced the 2005 license agreement between Indices and CME Group. Under the terms of the License Agreement, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC receives a share of the profits from the trading and clearing of CME Group’s equity index products. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned $\n174\nmillion $\n170\nmillion and $\n139\nmillion of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement, respectively. The entire amount of this revenue is included in our consolidated statement of income and the portion related to the\n27\n% noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nContractual Obligations\nWe typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized. For example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance. In the first quarter of 2023, S&P Global and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) entered into a multi-year strategic collaboration agreement with a purchase obligation of $\n1.0\nbillion, before incremental credits, over a\nfive-year\nperiod. With AWS as its preferred cloud provider, S&P Global will enhance its cloud infrastructure, accelerate business growth, engineer new innovations for key industry segments, and help their customers navigate rapidly changing market conditions\n.\nLegal & Regulatory Matters\nIn the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often subjected to government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries.\nA class action lawsuit was filed in Australia on August 7, 2020 against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company.  A separate lawsuit was filed against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company in Australia on February 2, 2021 by\ntwo\nentities within the Basis Capital investment group. The lawsuits both relate to alleged investment losses in collateralized debt obligations rated by Ratings prior to the financial crisis.  We can provide no assurance that we will not be obligated to pay significant amounts in order to resolve these matters on terms deemed acceptable.\nFrom time to time, the Company receives customer complaints.  The Company believes it has strong contractual protections in the terms and conditions included in its arrangements with customers.  Nonetheless, in the interest of managing customer relationships, the Company from time to time engages in dialogue with such customers in an effort to resolve such complaints, and if such complaints cannot be resolved through dialogue, may face litigation regarding such complaints.  The Company does not expect to incur material losses as a result of these matters.\nMoreover, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities, antitrust matters and other matters, such as ESG. For example, as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (\"NRSRO\") registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Exchange Act, S&P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. S&P Global Ratings is currently responding to requests for documents and information from the SEC in connection with an investigation concerning S&P Global Ratings’ compliance with record retention requirements relating to electronic business communications sent or received via electronic messaging channels. As has been publicly reported, the SEC has undertaken similar investigations across various industries, including other NRSROs. Although S&P Global seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC or another regulator raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulator will not seek remedies against S&P Global for one or more compliance deficiencies. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.\nIn view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity (if any) restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that such outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on\n122\nTable of Contents\nour consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n123\nTable of Contents"

The number of performance stock unit awards is based on the target number of units granted.\n2\nRestricted stock units, performance stock units and director deferred phantom stock units do not have an exercise price and are delivered without any payment or consideration other than service.\n3\nIncluded in this number are 483,834 shares reserved for issuance under the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. The remaining 18,332,189 shares are reserved for issuance under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) for performance stock, restricted stock, other stock-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights.\n4\nUnder the terms of the 2019 Plan, shares subject to an award or shares paid in settlement of a dividend equivalent reduce the number of shares available under the 2019 Plan by one share for each such share granted or paid.\nThe 2019 Plan is also governed by certain share recapture provisions.  Only shares underlying awards granted under the 2019 Plan that are forfeited, expired, cancelled, terminated, settled in cash or property other than shares, or otherwise not distributable, are added back to the shares available for issuance. Shares withheld to satisfy the exercise price of an award or to satisfy any required tax withholding obligations, or that are repurchased by the Company with option proceeds are not added back to the shares available for issuance.\nInformation on the number of shares our common stock beneficially owned by each director and named executive officer, by all directors and executive officers as a group and on each beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock is contained under the caption “Ownership of Company Stock” in our 2024 Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference."
