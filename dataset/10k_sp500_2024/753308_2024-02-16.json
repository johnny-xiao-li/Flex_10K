    "text": "OVERVIEW\nNEE is one of the largest electric power and energy infrastructure companies in North America and a leader in the renewable energy industry. NEE has two principal businesses, FPL and NEER. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. FPL’s strategic focus is centered on investing in generation, transmission and distribution facilities to deliver on its value proposition of low customer bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy for the benefit of its approximately\n5.9 million\ncustomer accounts. NEER is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun, as well as a world leader in battery storage. NEER’s strategic focus is centered on the development, construction and operation of long-term contracted assets throughout the U.S. and Canada, primarily consisting of clean energy assets, such as renewable generation facilities, and electric transmission facilities, as well as providing other clean energy solutions to its customers.\nIn January 2019, NEE acquired Gulf Power Company, a rate-regulated electric utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in northwest Florida. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However, during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities in the former service areas of FPL and Gulf Power Company. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one electric ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs (see FPL – FPL Regulation – FPL Electric Rate Regulation – Base Rates – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025).\nAs described in more detail in the following sections, NEE seeks to create value in its two principal businesses by meeting its customers' needs more economically and more reliably than its competitors. NEE's strategy has resulted in profitable growth over sustained periods at both FPL and NEER. Management seeks to grow each business (see Note 15 – Commitments) in a manner consistent with the varying opportunities available to it; however, management believes that the diversification and balance represented by FPL and NEER is a valuable characteristic of the enterprise and recognizes that each business contributes to NEE's financial strength in different ways. FPL and NEER share a common platform with the objective of lowering costs, creating efficiencies and encouraging innovative ideas for their businesses. NEE and its subsidiaries, with employees totaling approximately 16,800 as of December 31, 2023, continue to develop and implement enterprise-wide initiatives focused on improving productivity, process effectiveness and quality.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law which, among other things, extends the period for wind and solar tax credits, expands the tax credits to support a broader range of renewable technologies and allows renewable energy tax credits to be transferred. See NEER – Clean Energy and Other Operations – Clean Energy – Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects. NEE believes the IRA provides long-term visibility and supports the growth of its businesses.\nNEE's reportable segments for financial reporting purposes are FPL and NEER (see Note 16). NEECH, a wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, owns and provides funding for NEE's operating subsidiaries, other than FPL and its subsidiaries. NEP, an affiliate of NextEra Energy Resources, acquires, manages and owns contracted clean energy assets with stable, long-term cash flows. See NEER section below for further discussion of NEP. The following diagram depicts NEE's simplified ownership structure:\n4\nFPL\nFPL is a rate-regulated electric utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in Florida. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. At December 31, 2023, FPL had 33,276 MW of net generating capacity, approximately 90,000 circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines and 883 substations. FPL provides service to its electric customers through an integrated transmission and distribution system that links its generation facilities to its customers.\nFPL serves more than 12 million people through approximately 5.9 million customer accounts. The following map shows FPL's service areas and plant locations as of February 16, 2024, which cover most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and are in ten counties throughout northwest Florida (see FPL Sources of Generation below).\n5\nCUSTOMERS AND REVENUE\nFPL's primary source of operating revenues is from its retail customer base; it also serves a limited number of wholesale customers within Florida. The percentage of FPL's operating revenues and customer accounts\nby customer class were as follows:\nFor both retail and wholesale customers, the prices (or rates) that FPL may charge are approved by regulatory bodies, by the FPSC in the case of retail customers and by the FERC in the case of wholesale customers. In general, under U.S. and Florida law, regulated rates are intended to cover the cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Since the regulatory bodies have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed, there can be no guarantee that FPL will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of its costs through regulated rates. See FPL Regulation below.\nFPL seeks to maintain attractive rates for its customers. Since rates are largely cost-based, maintaining low rates requires a strategy focused on developing and maintaining a low-cost position, including the implementation of ideas generated from cost savings initiatives.\nFRANCHISE AGREEMENTS AND COMPETITION\nFPL's service to its electric retail customers is provided primarily under franchise agreements negotiated with municipalities or counties. During the term of a franchise agreement, which is typically 30 years, the municipality or county agrees not to form its own utility,\nand FPL has the right to offer electric service to residents. At December 31, 2023, FPL held 226 franchise agreements with various municipalities and counties in Florida with varying expiration dates through 2053. These franchise agreements cover the vast majority of FPL's retail customer base in Florida. At December 31, 2023, FPL also provided service to customers in 10 other municipalities and to 27\nunincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements pursuant to the general obligation to serve as a public utility. FPL relies upon Florida law for access to public rights of way.\nBecause any customer may elect to provide their own electric services, FPL effectively must compete for an individual customer's business. As a practical matter, few customers provide their own service at the present time since FPL's cost of service is lower than the cost of self-generation for a significant majority of customers. Changing technology (particularly increasing efficiency of solar power generation), tax incentives, economic conditions, regulatory changes, increasing cost-competitiveness of rooftop solar and batteries and other factors could alter the favorable relative cost position that FPL currently enjoys; however, FPL seeks as a matter of strategy to ensure that it delivers superior value, in the form of comparatively low customer bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy.\nIn addition to self-generation by residential, commercial and industrial customers, FPL also faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale and industrial customers and from alternative energy sources. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, operating revenues from wholesale and ind\nustrial electric customers combined represented approximately\n5%, 7% and 6%, respectively, of FPL's total operating revenues.\nFor the building of new steam and solar generating capacity of 75 MW or greater, the FPSC requires investor-owned electric utilities, including FPL, to issue a request for proposal (RFP) except when the FPSC determines that an exception from the RFP process is in the public interest. The RFP process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity. If a bidder has the most cost-effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and/or operating generating capacity of the type proposed, the investor-owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a PPA with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC approve the terms of the PPA and, if appropriate, provide the required authorization for the construction of the bidder's generating capacity.\n6\nFPL\nSOURCES OF GENERATION\nAt December 31, 2023, FPL's resources for serving load consisted of approximately 33,520 MW of net generating capacity, of which\n33,276\nMW were from FPL-owned facilities and\n244\nMW were available through PPAs. FPL owned and operated\n44\nunits with generating capacity of 24,254 MW that primarily use natural gas and 66 solar generation facilities with generating capacity totaling 4,803 MW. In addition, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated 4 nuclear units with net generating capacity totaling 3,502 MW (see Nuclear Operations below) and had joint ownership interests in 3 coal units located in Mississippi and Georgia it did not operate with net generating capacity totaling 717 MW. FPL retired its share of two coal units in Mississippi in January 2024 and the remaining one in Georgia is expected to be retired in 2028. See Note 7 – Jointly-Owned Electric Plants regarding the retirement of these plants. FPL also develops and constructs battery storage projects, which when combined with its solar projects, serve to enhance its ability to meet customer needs for a nearly firm generation source. At December 31, 2023, FPL had 469 MW of battery storage capacity that delivers energy to the transmission system. FPL customer usage and operating revenues are typically higher during the summer months, largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in its service area. Occasionally, unusually cold temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in electricity usage for short periods of time.\nThrough 2025, FPL plans to add new solar generation with cost recovery through base rates, either through a Solar Base Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) or SolarTogether\n®\n(a voluntary community solar program that gives FPL electric customers an opportunity to participate directly in the expansion of solar energy where participants pay a fixed monthly subscription charge and receive credits on their related monthly customer bill). FPL placed 894 MW of solar generating capacity in service in January 2024 and is currently in the process of constructing an additional 1,341 MW and 894 MW of solar generating capacity, which is expected to be placed in service in 2024 and in 2025, respectively (see FPL Regulation – FPL Electric Rate Regulation – Base Rates – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below).\nFuel Sources\nFPL relies upon a mix of fuel sources for its generation facilities, the ability of some of its generation facilities to operate on both natural gas and low sulfur diesel, and on purchased power to maintain the flexibility to achieve a more economical fuel mix in order to respond to market and industry\ndevelopments. See discussion of planned solar generation additions above. In 2023, FPL placed a hydrogen facility in service that blends green hydrogen with natural gas at an existing natural gas generation facility.\nSignificant Fuel and Transportation Contracts.\nAt December 31, 2023, FPL had the following significant fuel and transportation contracts in place:\n•\nfirm transportation contracts with ten different transportation suppliers for natural gas pipeline capacity for an aggregate maximum delivery quantity of 2,836,000 MMBtu/day with expiration dates through 2042\n(see Note 15 – Contracts);\n•\nseveral contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates through 2037; and\n•\nshort- and medium-term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of FPL's anticipated needs for natural gas,\n7\nwith the remainder of FPL's natural gas requirements being purchased in the spot market.\nNuclear Operations\nAt December 31, 2023, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated the four nuclear units in Florida discussed below. FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time.\n______________________\n(a)    In 2021, FPL filed an application with the NRC to renew both St. Lucie operating licenses for an additional 20 years. License renewals are pending.\n(b)    Excludes 147 MW operated by FPL but owned by non-affiliates.\n(c)    In 2022, FPL filed a site-specific environmental impact statement with the NRC related to the previously approved 20-year renewal application for both Turkey Point operating licenses. Approval of the additional 20 years of operations is pending.\nNRC regulations require FPL to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. If the license renewals are approved by the NRC, FPL's plans provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be shut down in 2056 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 commencing in 2063. If the NRC approves an additional 20 years of operations, FPL's plans provide for the dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 with decommissioning activities commencing in 2052 and 2053, respectively.\nFPL's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through license expiration, as well as through any pending license extensions.\nFPL ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING\nFPL's Energy Marketing & Trading division (EMT) buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, low sulfur diesel, electricity and renewable energy credits (RECs) from certain FPL solar generation assets. EMT procures natural gas and low sulfur diesel for FPL's use in power generation and sells excess natural gas, low sulfur diesel and electricity. EMT also uses derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. Substantially all of the results of EMT's activities are passed through to customers in the fuel or capacity clauses. See Management's Discussion – Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity and Note 3.\nFPL REGULATION\nFPL's operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and other organizations, including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\nthe FPSC, which has jurisdiction over retail rates, service area, issuances of securities, and planning, siting and construction of facilities, among other things;\n•\nthe FERC, which oversees the acquisition and disposition of electric generation, transmission and other facilities, transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce, proposals to build and operate interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy, among other things;\n•\nthe NERC, which, through its regional entities, establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards, subject to approval by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system blackouts;\n•\nthe NRC, which has jurisdiction over the operation of nuclear power plants through the issuance of operating licenses, rules, regulations and orders; and\n•\nthe EPA, which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in some cases delegating authority to state agencies. The EPA also works with industries and all levels of government, including federal and state governments, in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.\n8\nFPL Electric Rate Regulation\nThe FPSC sets rates at a level that is intended to allow the utility the opportunity to collect from retail customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to its cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. To accomplish this, the FPSC uses various ratemaking mechanisms, including, among other things, base rates and cost recovery clauses. Although FPL and Gulf Power Company merged effective January 1, 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate rate making entities until January 1, 2022 when new unified rates and tariffs became effective for the combined utility system (including the former Gulf Power Company service area). See Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below.\nBase Rates\n.\nIn general, the basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other costs, are recovered through base rates, which are designed to recover the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system. These basic costs include O&M expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a return on investment in assets used and useful in providing electric service (rate base). At the time base rates are established, the allowed rate of return on rate base approximates the FPSC's determination of the utility's estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which\nincludes its costs for outstanding debt and an allowed return on common equity. The FPSC monitors the utility's actual regulatory ROE through a surveillance report that is filed monthly with the FPSC. The FPSC does not provide assurance that any regulatory ROE will be achieved. Base rates are determined in rate proceedings o\nr through negotiated settlements of those proceedings. Proceedings can occur at the initiative of the utility or upon action by the FPSC. Existing base rates remain in effect until new base rates are approved by the FPSC.\nBase Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025\n– In December 2021, the FPSC issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2021 rate agreement).\nKey elements of the 2021 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2022 through at least December 2025, include, among other things, the following:\n•\nNew retail base rates and charges were established for the combined utility system (including the former Gulf Power Company service area) resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues:\n◦\n$692 million beginning January 1, 2022, and\n◦\n$560 million beginning January 1, 2023.\n•\nIn addition, FPL is eligible to receive, subject to conditions specified in the 2021 rate agreement, base rate increases associated with the addition of up to 894 MW annually of new solar generation through the SoBRA mechanism in each of 2024 and 2025, and may carry forward any unused MW in 2024 to 2025. FPL has agreed to an installed cost cap of $1,250 per kW and will be required to demonstrate that these proposed solar facilities are cost effective.\n•\nFPL's authorized regulatory ROE was 10.60%, with a range of 9.70% to 11.70%. However, in the event the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate was 2.49% or greater over a consecutive six-month period, FPL was authorized to increase the regulatory ROE to 10.80% with a range of 9.80% to 11.80%. During August 2022, this provision was triggered and effective September 1, 2022, FPL's authorized regulatory ROE and ROE range were increased. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below 9.80%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above 11.80%, any party with standing may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates.\n•\nSubject to certain conditions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2021 rate agreement, up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, provided that in any year of the 2021 rate agreement FPL must amortize at least enough reserve amount to maintain its minimum authorized regulatory ROE and also may not amortize any reserve amount that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of its maximum authorized regulatory ROE.\n•\nFPL is authorized to expand SolarTogether\n®\nby constructing an additional 1,788 MW of solar generation from 2022 through 2025, such that the total capacity of SolarTogether\n®\nwould be 3,278 MW.\n•\nFuture storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kWh of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4 surcharge. See Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\n•\nIf federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the 2021 rate agreement, FPL will prospectively adjust base rates after a review by the FPSC. As a result of the enactment of the IRA (see NEER – Clean Energy and Other Operations – Clean Energy – Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects), FPL's customers are expected to save approximately $400 million over the remaining term of the 2021 rate agreement which includes a $36 million one-time refund made in January 2023.\nOn September 28, 2023, the Florida Supreme Court ruled on the appeal of the FPSC’s final order regarding FPL’s 2021 rate agreement by Floridians Against Increased Rates, Inc. and, as a group, Florida Rising, Inc., Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Inc. and League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida. The ruling remands the FPSC's order back to the FPSC. While management is unable to predict with certainty the eventual outcome, FPL believes the FPSC's subsequent order will maintain its determination that the 2021 rate agreement is in the public interest and should remain intact.\nBase Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021\n– From January 2017 to December 2021, FPL operated under a base rate agreement (2016 rate agreement) that provided for, among other things, a regulatory ROE of 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60% and, subject to certain conditions, the right to reduce depreciation expense up to $1.25 billion (reserve),\n9\nprovided that in any year of the 2016 rate agreement FPL was required to amortize enough reserve to maintain an earned regulatory ROE within the range of 9.60% to 11.60%.\nCost Recovery Clauses\n.\nCost recovery clauses are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through these clauses. Cost recovery clause costs are recovered through levelized monthly charges per kWh or kW, depending on the customer's rate class. These cost recovery clause charges are calculated annually based on estimated costs and estimated customer usage for the following year, plus or minus true-up adjustments to reflect the estimated over or under recovery of costs for the current and prior periods. An adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved during the course of a year to reflect revised estimates. FPL recovers costs from customers through the following clauses:\n•\nFuel\n–\nprimarily fuel costs, the most significant of the cost recovery clauses in terms of operating revenues (see Note 1\n–\nRate Regulation);\n•\nStorm Protection Plan\n–\ncosts associated with an FPSC-approved transmission and distribution storm protection plan, which includes costs for hardening of overhead transmission and distribution lines, undergrounding of certain distribution lines and\nvegetation management;\n•\nCapacity – primarily certain costs associated with the acquisition of several electric generation facilities (see Note 1 – Rate Regulation) and capacity payments related to PPAs;\n•\nEnergy Conservatio\nn\n–\ncosts associated with implementing energy conservation programs; and\n•\nEnvironmental – certain costs of complying with federal, state and local environmental regulations enacted after April 1993 and costs associated with certain of FPL's solar facilities placed in service prior to 2016.\nThe FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. These costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when generation units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities.\nFERC\nThe Federal Power Act grants the FERC exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, electric utilities must file for FERC acceptance and maintain tariffs and rate schedules which govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. Wholesale power sales tariffs on file at FERC may authorize sales at cost-based rates or, where the seller lacks market power, at market-based rates. The Federal Power Act also gives the FERC authority to certify and oversee an electric reliability organization with authority to establish and independently enforce mandatory reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk-power system. See NERC below. Electric utilities are subject to accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements administered by the FERC. The FERC also places certain limitations on transactions between electric utilities and their affiliates.\nNERC\nThe NERC has been certified by the FERC as an electric reliability organization. The NERC's mandate is to ensure the reliability and security of the North American bulk-power system through the establishment and enforcement of reliability standards approved by FERC. The NERC's regional entities also enforce reliability standards approved by the FERC. FPL is subject to these reliability standards and incurs costs to ensure compliance with continually heightened requirements, and can incur significant penalties for failing to comply with them.\nFPL Environmental Regulation\nFPL is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. FPL expects to seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations.\nFPL HUMAN CAPITAL\nFPL had approximately 9,500\nemployees at December 31, 2023, with approximately 31% of these employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers\n(IBEW). The collective bargaining agreements\nhave approximate\nly two- to three-year terms and expire between April 2024 and January 2025.\n10\nNEER\nNEER,\ncomprised of NEE's competitive energy and rate-regulated transmission businesses, is a diversified clean energy business with a strategy that emphasizes the development, construction and operation of long-term contracted assets with a focus on clean energy. NEE reports NextEra Energy Resources and NEET, a rate-regulated transmission business, on a combined basis for segment reporting purposes, and the combined segment is referred to as NEER. The NEER segment owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets in the U.S. a\nnd Canada and also includes assets and investments in other businesses with a clean energy focus, such as battery storage and renewable fuels. NEER, with appr\noximately 30,600 MW of total net generating capacity\nat December 31, 2023, is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the U.S., including approximately 30,080 MW of net generating capacity across 41 states and 520 MW of net generating capacity in 4 Canadian provinces\n.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2023\n,\nNEER operates facilities, in which it has partial or full ownership interests, with a total generating capacity of approximately 37,700 MW. NEER primarily sells its capacity and/or energy output through\nlong-term power sales agreements with utilities, retail electricity providers, power cooperatives, municipal electric providers and commercial and industrial customers.\nNEER produces the majority of its electricity from clean and renewable sources as described more fully below. In addition, NEER develops and constructs battery storage projects, which when combined with its renewable projects, serve to enhance its ability to meet customers' firm capacity needs, or as standalone facilities. NEER is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun based on 2023 MWh produced on a net generation basis, as well as a world leader in battery storage. The NEER segment also owns, develops, constructs and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities in North America. At December 31, 2023, NEER's rate-regulated transmission facilities and the transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid are comprised of approximately 330 substations and 3,585 circuit miles of transmission lines.\nNEER also engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities, including entering into financial and physical contracts. These contracts primarily include power and fuel commodities and their related products for the purpose of providing full energy and capacity requirements services, primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets, and offering customized power and fuel and related risk management services to wholesale customers, as well as to hedge the production from NEER's generation assets that is not sold under long-term power supply agreements. In addition, NEER participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production through operating and non-operating ownership interests, and in pipeline infrastructure construction, management and operations, through either wholly owned subsidiaries or noncontrolling or joint venture interests, hereafter referred to as the gas infrastructure business. NEER also hedges the expected output from its gas infrastructure production assets to protect against price movements.\nNEP\n–\nThrough NEP OpCo, NEP acquires, manages and owns contracted clean energy assets with stable long-term cash flows with a focus on renewable energy projects. NEP's assets include energy projects contributed by or acquired from NextEra Energy Resources, or acquired from third parties, as well as ownership interests in a contracted natural gas pipeline acquired from third parties. NEP also invests to repower or expand certain of its assets. NextEra Energy Resources' indirect limited partnership interest in NEP OpCo based on the number of outstanding NEP OpCo common units was approximately 51.4% at December 31, 2023.\nNextEra Energy Resources accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings\n(losses)\nof equity method investees and accounts for its project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2023, NEP owned, or had a partial ownership interest in, a portfolio of contracted renewable energy assets consisting of wind, solar and battery storage projects with energy project capacity totaling approximately 10,118 MW and a contracted natural gas pipeline all located in the U.S. as further discussed in Clean Energy and Other Operations.\nNextEra Energy Resources operates essentially all of the energy projects in NEP's portfolio and its ownership interest in the portfolio's capacity was approximately 4,786 MW at December 31, 2023.\nCLEAN ENERGY AND OTHER OPERATIONS\nNEER sells products associated with its generation facilities (energy, capacity, RECs and ancillary services) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities are located. Customer transactions may be supplied from NEER generation facilities or from purchases in the wholesale markets, or from a combination thereof. See Markets and Competition below.\n11\nNEER's generation and battery storage projects, natural gas pipelines and transmission facilities (including noncontrolling or joint venture interests) at December 31, 2023 are as follows:\n12\nClean Energy\nGeneration Assets\nNEER's portfolio of generation assets primarily consists of generation facilities with long-term power sales agreements for substantially all of their capacity and/or energy output. Information related to contracted generation assets at December 31, 2023 was as follows:\n•\nrepresented approximately 28,759 MW of total net generating capacity;\n•\nweighted-average remaining contract term of the power sales agreements, including the remaining life of the PTCs associated with repowered wind facilities, of approximately 15 years, based on forecasted contributions to earnings and forecasted amounts of electricity produced by the repowered wind facilities; and\n•\nseveral contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel for all nuclear units with expiration dates through 2033 (see Note 15 – Contracts).\nNEER's merchant generation assets primarily consist of generation facilities that do not have long-term power sales agreements to sell their capacity and/or energy output and therefore require active marketing and hedging. Merchant generation assets at December 31, 2023 represented approximately 1,842 MW of total net generating capacity, including 805 MW from nuclear generation and 1,032 MW from other peak generation facilities, and are primarily located in the Northeast region of the U.S. NEER utilizes swaps, options, futures and forwards to lock in pricing and manage the commodity price risk inherent in power sales and fuel purchases.\n13\nNEER Generation Assets Fuel/Technology Mix\nDuring 2023, NextEra Energy Resources generated approximately 96 million megawatt hours utilizing the following mix of fuel\nsources for generation facilities in which it has an ownership interest:\nWind Facilities\n•\nlocated in 23 states in the U.S. and 4 provinces in Canada;\n•\noperated a total generating capacity of approximately 24,970 MW at December 31, 2023;\n•\nownership interests in a total net generating capacity of approximately 20,147 MW at December 31, 2023;\n◦\nessentially all MW are from contracted wind assets located primarily throughout Texas and the West and Midwest\nregions of the U.S. and Canada;\n◦\nadded approximately 1,651 MW of new generating capacity\nin the U.S. in 2023 and sold assets to NEP totaling approximately 292 MW (see Note 1\n–\nDisposal of Businesses/Assets and\nSale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests\n).\nSolar Facilities\n•\nlocated in 31 states in the U.S.;\n•\noperated photovoltaic and solar thermal facilities with a total generating capacity of approximately 7,650 MW at December 31, 2023;\n•\nownership interests in solar facilities with a total net generating capacity of approximately 5,856 MW at December 31, 2023;\n◦\nessentially all MW are from contracted solar facilities located primarily throughout the West and South regions of the U.S.;\n◦\nadded approximately 2,073 MW of generating capacity in the U.S. in 2023 and sold assets to NEP totaling approximately 122 MW (see Note 1\n–\nDisposal of Businesses/Assets and\nSale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests\n).\nNuclear Facilities\nAt December 31, 2023, NextEra Energy Resources was the sole owner of the two Point Beach nuclear units shown in the table below and was the largest joint owner of the Seabrook nuclear facility shown in the table below. NEER's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time.\n14\n______________________\n(a)    Excludes 147 MW operated by NEER but owned by non-affiliates.\n(b)    Includes 297 MW sold under a long-term contract.\n(c)    NEER sells all of the output of Point Beach Units Nos. 1 and 2 under long-term contracts through their current operating license expiration dates.\n(d)    In 2020, NEER filed an application with the NRC to renew both Point Beach operating licenses for an additional 20 years. License renewals are pending.\nNEER is responsible for all nuclear unit operations and the ultimate decommissioning of the nuclear units, the cost of which is shared on a pro-rata basis by the joint owners with respect to the Seabrook unit. NRC regulations require plant owners to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. NEER's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which, based on existing regulations, are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through current license expiration, as well as through any pending license extensions.\nNEER also maintains an approximately 70% interest in Duane Arnold, a nuclear facility located in Iowa that ceased operations in August 2020. NEER submitted a site-specific cost estimate and plan for decontamination and decommissioning to the NRC. All spent nuclear fuel housed onsite is in long-term dry storage until the DOE is able to take possession. NEER estimates that the cost of decommissioning Duane Arnold is fully funded and expects completion by approximately 2080.\nOther Clean Energy\nNEER's portfolio also includes assets and investments in other businesses with a clean energy focus, such as battery storage and renewable fuels. At December 31, 2023, NextEra Energy Resources had net\nownership interests in approximately 2,624 MW of battery storage capacity.\nIn addition, NextEra Energy Resources owns, or has a partial ownership interest in, a portfolio of 29 biogas projects, one of which is an operating renewable natural gas facility and the others of which are primarily operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities.\nPolicy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Pursuant to the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, wind and solar generation facilities are depreciated for tax purposes over a five-year period even though the useful life of such facilities is generally much longer than five years.\nOwners of wind and solar facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended several times for wind (the previous PTC for solar expired in 2006). The IRA expanded the PTC to include solar generation facilities and extended the 100% PTC and the 30% ITC to wind and solar generation facilities that start construction before the later of 2034 or the end of the calendar year following the year in which greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. electric generation are reduced by 75% from 2022 levels (phaseout). Accordingly, owners of wind and solar generation facilities placed in service in 2022 or later are eligible to claim a PTC (or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the facility during the first ten years of commercial operation. Alternatively, an ITC equal to 30% of the cost of the facility may be claimed in lieu of the PTC. A facility must also meet certain labor requirements to qualify for the 100% PTC or 30% ITC rate or construction must have started on the facility before January 29, 2023. In addition, the PTC is increased by 10% and the ITC rate is increased by 10 percentage points for facilities that satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirements. Retrofitted wind and solar generation facilities may qualify for a PTC or an ITC if the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the retrofitted facility’s total fair value.\nIn addition, the IRA expanded the 30% ITC to include storage projects placed in service after 2022 (previously, such projects qualified only if they were connected to and charged by a renewable generation facility that claimed the ITC) as well as certain property with respect to renewable natural gas facilities that are placed in service after 2022 and begin construction before 2025. The 30% ITC to storage projects is subject to the phaseout. The IRA created a PTC of $3/kilogram of green (low emission) hydrogen produced at a facility after 2022 and during the first ten years of commercial operation (or a 30% ITC in lieu of the PTC), provided that construction of the facility begins before 2033. These credits are also subject to certain other requirements. In addition, storage projects and hydrogen facilities claiming an ITC are eligible for a 10 percentage point increase in the ITC rate if the facilities satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirements. A wind or solar project that provides electricity to a green hydrogen facility may qualify for the PTC or ITC and the hydrogen facility may separately qualify for its own PTC or ITC.\n15\nFor taxable years beginning after 2022, renewable energy tax credits generated during the year can be transferred to an unrelated purchaser for cash, providing an additional path, along with sales of differential membership interests, for developers to monetize the value of renewable energy tax credits.\nOther countries, including Canada, provide for incentives like feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy projects. The feed-in-tariffs promote renewable energy investments by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy producers, typically based on the cost of generation of each technology.\nOther Operations\nGas Infrastructure Business\n– At December 31, 2023, NextEra Energy Resources had ownership interests in natural gas pipelines, the most significant of which are discussed below, and in oil and gas shale formations located primarily in the Midwest and South regions of the U.S.\n______________________\n(a)    See Note 15 – Contracts for a discussion of transportation contracts with FPL.\n(b)       See Note 15 – Contracts for a discussion of a transportation contract with a NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary.\nIn December 2023, NEP completed the sale of its ownership interests in a portfolio of natural gas pipelines located in south Texas.\nRate-Regulated Transmission\n– At December 31, 2023, certain entities within the NEER segment had ownership interests in rate-regulated transmission and related facilities.\n______________________\n(a)    Includes a 26-mile transmission line and 5 substations, in which NEET owns a 65% interest.\n(b)    Direct current\n(c)    Includes a substation, in which NEET owns an 88.3% interest.\nCustomer Supply\n–\nNEER provides commodities-related products to customers, engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities and includes the operations of a retail electricity provider. Through NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary PMI, NEER:\n•\nmanages risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices and optimizes the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure production assets through the use of swaps, options, futures and forwards;\n•\nsells output from NEER's plants that is not sold under long-term contracts and procures fuel for use by NEER's generation fleet;\n•\nprovides full energy and capacity requirements to customers; and\n•\nmarkets and trades energy-related commodity products, including power and fuel, as well as marketing and trading services to customers.\n16\nMARKETS AND COMPETITION\nElectricity markets in the U.S. and Canada are regional and diverse in character. All are extensively regulated, and competition in these markets is shaped and constrained by regulation. The nature of the products offered varies based on the specifics of regulation in each region. Generally, in addition to the natural constraints on pricing freedom presented by competition, NEER may also face specific constraints in the form of price caps, or maximum allowed prices, for certain products. NEER's ability to sell the output of its generation facilities may also be constrained by available transmission capacity, which can vary from time to time and can have a significant impact on pricing.\nThe degree and nature of competition is different in wholesale markets than in retail markets. A majority of NEER's revenues are derived from sales of energy, capacity, credits and ancillary products under long-term PPAs to customers located in wholesale electricity markets. Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. NEER primarily competes on the basis of price, but believes the green attributes of NEER's generation assets, its track record of completing projects on schedule, its creditworthiness and its ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solutions to wholesale customers are competitive advantages. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NEER competes with depending on the market. In wholesale markets, customers' needs are met through a variety of means, including long-term bilateral contracts, standardized bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and risk management services.\nIn general, U.S. and Canadian electricity markets encompass three classes of services: energy and related energy credits, capacity and ancillary services. Energy services relate to the physical delivery of power; capacity services relate to the availability of MW capacity of a power generation asset; and ancillary services are other services that relate to power generation assets, such as load regulation and spinning and non-spinning reserves. The exact nature of these classes of services is defined in part by regional tariffs. Not all regions have a capacity services class, and the specific definitions of ancillary services vary from region to region.\nRTOs and ISOs exist throughout much of North America to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic areas and to run markets. NEER operates in all RTO and ISO jurisdictions. At December 31, 2023, NEER also had generation facilities with a total net generating capacity of approximately 7,944 MW that fall within reliability regions that are not under the jurisdiction of an established RTO or ISO, including 5,743 MW within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and 2,119 MW within the SERC Reliability Corporation. Although each RTO and ISO may have differing objectives and structures, some benefits of these entities include regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing larger wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity providers.\n17\nNEER has operations that fall within the following RTOs and ISOs\n:\nNEER competes in different regions to differing degrees, but in general it seeks to enter into long-term bilateral contracts for the full output of its generation facilities. At December 31, 2023, approximately 94% of NEER's net generating capacity was committed under long-term contracts. Where long-term contracts are not in effect, NEER sells the output of its facilities into daily spot markets. In such cases, NEER will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contracts, typically of less than three years duration, to hedge the price risk associated with selling into a daily spot market. Such bilateral contracts, which may be hedges either for physical delivery or for financial (pricing) offset, serve to protect a portion of the revenue that NEER expects to derive from the associated generation facility. Contracts that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of a generation facility but are not recorded as hedges under GAAP are referred to as “non-qualifying hedges” for adjusted earnings purposes. See Management's Discussion – Overview – Adjusted Earnings.\nCertain facilities within the NEER wind and solar generation portfolio produce RECs and other environmental attributes which are typically sold along with the energy from the plants under long-term contracts, or may be sold separately from wind and solar generation not sold under long-term contracts. The purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting rights and ownership of the environmental attributes.\nWhile the majority of NEER's revenue is derived from the output of its generation facilities, NEER is also an active competitor in several regions in the wholesale full requirements business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel products and services to a variety of customers. In the full requirements service, typically, the supplier agrees to meet the customer's needs for a full range of products for every hour of the day, at a fixed price, for a predetermined period of time, thereby assuming the risk of fluctuations in the customer's volume requirements.\nExpanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NEER. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient facilities that can sell power in competitive markets. NEER seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its facilities.\n18\nNEER REGULATION\nThe energy markets in which NEER operates are subject to domestic and foreign regulation, as the case may be, including local, state and federal regulation, and other specific rules.\nAt December 31, 2023\n, essentially all of NEER's generation facilities\nlocated in the U.S. have received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. Exempt wholesale generators own or operate a facility exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers. They are barred from selling electricity directly to retail customers. While projects with exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various restrictions, each project must still comply with other federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, those regarding siting, construction, operation, licensing, pollution abatement and other environmental laws.\nAdditionally, most of the NEER facilities located in the U.S. are subject to FERC regulations and market rules and the NERC's mandatory reliability standards, all of its facilities are subject to environmental laws and the EPA's environmental regulations, and its nuclear facilities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. See FPL – FPL Regulation for additional discussion of FERC, NERC, NRC and EPA regulations. Rates of NEER's rate-regulated transmission businesses are set by regulatory bodies as noted in Clean Energy and Other Operations – Other Operations – Rate-Regulated Transmission. With the exception of facilities located in ERCOT, the FERC has jurisdiction over various aspects of NEER's business in the U.S., including the oversight and investigation of competitive wholesale energy markets, regulation of the transmission and sale of natural gas, and oversight of environmental matters related to natural gas projects and major electricity policy initiatives. The PUCT has jurisdiction, including the regulation of rates and services, oversight of competitive markets, and enforcement of statutes and rules, over NEER facilities located in ERCOT.\nCertain entities within the NEER segment and their affiliates are also subject to federal and provincial or regional regulations in Canada related to energy operations, energy markets and environmental standards. In Canada, activities related to owning and operating wind and solar projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are regulated at the provincial level. In Ontario, for example, electric generation facilities must be licensed by the OEB and may also be required to complete registrations and maintain market participant status with the IESO, in which case they must agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions of the market rules for the Ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC.\nIn addition, NEER is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. In order to better anticipate potential regulatory changes, NEER continues to actively evaluate and participate in regional market redesigns of existing operating rules for the integration of renewable energy resources and for the purchase and sale of energy commodities.\nNEER HUMAN CAPITAL\nNEER had approximately 7,300 employees at December 31, 2023. NEER has collective bargaining agreements with the IBEW, the Utility Workers Union of Amer\nica and the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America, which collectively repr\nesent approximately 6% of NEER's employees. The collective bargaining agreements have approximately\ntwo- to four-year terms and expire between June 2024 and December 2025.\nNEE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nNEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water quality and usage, waste management, wildlife protection and historical resources, for the siting, construction and ongoing operations of their facilities. The U.S. government and certain states and regions, as well as the Government of Canada and its provinces, have taken and continue to take certain actions, such as proposing and finalizing regulations or setting targets or goals, regarding the regulation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation. On May 23, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule that would restrict carbon emissions for both new and existing fossil power plants that meet specific criteria. FPL expects any costs to comply with the final rule, if enacted, to qualify for recovery under the environmental clause, subject to FPSC approval. The environmental laws in the U.S., including, among others, the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), provide for the protection of numerous species, including endangered species and/or their habitats, migratory birds, bats and eagles. In 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the northern long-eared bat as endangered, with two more species expected to be listed in 2024 and 2025. The environmental laws in Canada, including, among others, the Species at Risk Act, provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are endangered or threatened and the management of species of special concern. Complying with these environmental laws and regulations could result in, among other things, changes in the design and operation of, and additional costs associated with, existing facilities and changes or delays in the location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. Failure to comply could result in fines, penalties, criminal sanctions or injunctions. NEE's rate-regulated subsidiaries expect to seek recovery for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations, which recovery for FPL would be through the environmental clause.\n19\nWEBSITE ACCESS TO SEC FILINGS\nNEE and FPL make their SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on NEE's internet website, www.nexteraenergy.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information and materials available on NEE's website (or any of its subsidiaries' or affiliates' websites) are not incorporated by reference into this combined Form 10-K.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n(a)\n______________________\n(a)\nInformation is as of February 16, 2024.

    "text": "Risks Relating to NEE's and FPL's Business\nThe business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond the control of NEE and FPL. These risks, whether or not expressly stated with respect to any particular risk factor, as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or that are currently believed to not be material to the business, may materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL and may cause actual results of\nNEE and FPL to differ substantially from those that NEE or FPL currently expects or seeks. In that event, the market price for the securities of NEE or FPL could decline. Accordingly, the risks described below should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and in future reports that NEE and FPL file with the SEC.\nRegulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their business.\nThe operations of NEE and FPL are subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulation. This extensive regulatory framework, portions of which are more specifically identified in the following risk factors, regulates, among other things and to varying degrees, NEE's and FPL's industry, businesses, operations, and rates and cost structures, including: permitting, planning, construction and operation of electric generation, storage, transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas, oil and other fuel production, transportation, processing and storage facilities; acquisitions, disposals, depreciation and amortization of facilities and other assets; decommissioning costs and funding; service reliability; wholesale and retail competition; and commodities trading and derivatives transactions. In their business planning and in the management of their operations, NEE and FPL must address the effects of regulation on their business and any inability or failure to do so adequately could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if they are unable to recover in a timely manner any significant amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise.\nFPL operates as an electric utility and is subject to the jurisdiction of the FPSC over a wide range of business activities, including, among other items, the retail rates charged to its customers through base rates and cost recovery clauses, the terms and conditions of its services, procurement of electricity for its customers and fuel for its plant operations, issuances of securities, and aspects of the siting, planning, construction and operation of its generation plants and transmission and distribution systems for the sale of electric energy. The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery by FPL of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred, including those incurred to transition to lower carbon emission technology, and to determine the level of return that FPL is permitted to earn on invested capital. The regulatory process, which may be adversely affected by the geopolitical, political, regulatory, operational and economic environment in Florida and elsewhere, limits or could otherwise adversely impact FPL's earnings. The regulatory process also does not provide any assurance as to achievement of authorized or other earnings levels, or that FPL will be permitted to earn an acceptable return on capital investments it wishes to make. NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if any material amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital cannot be recovered through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise. Certain other subsidiaries of NEE are utilities subject to the jurisdiction of their regulators and are subject to similar risks.\nRegulatory decisions that are important to NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by political, regulatory, operational and economic factors.\nThe local and national political, regulatory and economic environment has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on regulatory decisions with negative consequences for NEE and FPL. These decisions, which may come from any level of government, may require, for example, FPL or NEER to cancel or delay planned development activities, to reduce or delay other planned capital expenditures or to pay for investments or otherwise incur costs that it may not be able to recover through rates or otherwise, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.\nAny reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support utility scale renewable energy, including, but not limited to, tax laws, policies and incentives, RPS and feed-in-tariffs, or the imposition of additional taxes, tariffs, duties or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects, NEE and FPL abandoning the development of renewable energy projects, a loss of investments in renewable energy projects and reduced project returns, any of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n21\nNEE depends heavily on government policies that support utility scale renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of developing and operating wind and solar energy projects in regions in which NEER and FPL operate or plan to develop and operate renewable energy facilities. The federal government, a majority of state governments in the U.S. and portions of Canada provide incentives, such as tax incentives, RPS or feed-in-tariffs, that support or are designed to support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facilities, such as wind and solar energy facilities. The development of renewable energy facilities at acceptable prices has not historically been burdened by actions taken by the U.S. government. However, as a result of budgetary constraints, geopolitical factors, political factors or otherwise, governments from time to time may review their laws and policies that support, or do not overly burden, the development and operation of renewable energy facilities and, instead, consider actions that would make the laws and policies less conducive to the development and operation of renewable energy facilities. Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy, such as the IRA, or the imposition of additional taxes, tariffs, duties or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it, such as policies in place that limit certain imports from China and other Southeast Asian countries, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects, NEE and FPL abandoning the development of renewable energy projects, a loss of investments in the projects and reduced project returns, any of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected as a result of new or revised laws or regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations.\nNEE's and FPL's business is influenced by various legislative and regulatory initiatives, including, but not limited to, new or revised laws, including international trade laws, regulations and interpretations, constitutional ballot and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation or restructuring of the energy industry, regulation of the commodities trading and derivatives markets, and regulation of environmental matters, such as regulation of air emissions, regulation of water consumption and water discharges, and regulation of gas and oil infrastructure operations, as well as associated environmental permitting. Changes in the nature of the regulation of NEE's and FPL's business could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. NEE and FPL are unable to predict future legislative or regulatory changes, including through constitutional ballot initiatives or changed legal or regulatory interpretations, although any such changes may increase costs and competitive pressures on NEE and FPL, which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFPL has limited, but growing, competition in the Florida market for retail electricity customers and is not subject to a RPS. Any changes in Florida law or regulation, whether through new or modified legislation or regulation or through citizen-approved state constitutional ballot initiatives, which increase competition in the Florida retail electricity market, such as government incentives that would further facilitate the installation of solar generation facilities on residential or other rooftops, would permit third-party sales of electricity or would mandate the transition to renewable energy at FPL, could have a material adverse effect on FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. There can be no assurance that FPL would be able to respond adequately to such regulatory changes, which could have a material adverse effect on FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEER is subject to FERC rules related to transmission that are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale market on practically a nationwide basis. NEE cannot predict the impact of changing FERC rules or policies of the RTOs and ISOs, such as rules governing generator interconnection procedures and transmission planning requirements and cost allocation methodologies, or the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand, which are typically driven by factors beyond NEE's control. There can be no assurance that NEER will be able to respond adequately or sufficiently quickly to such rules and developments, which may impact the ability, timeline and cost of interconnecting new or repowered energy projects to the transmission system and the availability of transmission system capacity to deliver energy products to market, or to any changes that reverse or restrict the competitive restructuring of the energy industry in those jurisdictions in which such restructuring has occurred. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE and FPL are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and other standards that may result in capital expenditures, increased operating costs and various liabilities, and may require NEE and FPL to limit or eliminate certain operations.\nNEE and FPL are subject to domestic environmental laws, regulations and other standards, including, but not limited to, extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality and usage, soil quality, climate change, emissions of greenhouse gases, waste management, hazardous wastes, marine, avian, bat and other wildlife mortality and habitat protection, historical artifact preservation, natural resources, health (including, but not limited to, electric and magnetic fields from power lines and substations), safety and RPS, that could, among other things, prevent or delay the development of power generation, power or natural gas transmission, or other infrastructure projects, restrict or enjoin the output of some existing facilities, limit the availability and use of some fuels required for the production of electricity, require additional pollution control equipment, and otherwise increase costs, increase capital expenditures and limit or eliminate certain\n22\noperations. Certain subsidiaries of NEE are also subject to foreign environmental laws, regulations and other standards and, as such, are subject to similar risks.\nThere are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations, and those costs could be even more significant in the future as a result of new requirements, stricter or more expansive application of existing environmental laws and regulations, and the addition of species, such as additional bat species, to the endangered species list.\nViolations of current or future laws, rules, regulations or other standards could expose NEE and FPL to regulatory and legal proceedings, disputes with, and legal challenges by, governmental entities and third parties, and potentially significant civil fines, criminal penalties and other sanctions, such as restrictions on how NextEra Energy Resources develops, sites and operates wind facilities. These violations could result in, without limitation, litigation regarding property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance and enforcement by citizens or governmental authorities of environmental requirements. For example, one of NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries is currently on probation as a result of accidental collisions of eagles into wind turbines at a number of NextEra Energy Resources' wind facilities. If NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiary violates the terms of the probation, or fails to obtain eagle “take” permits under the BGEPA or incidental take permits under the ESA for certain of its wind facilities and additional eagles or listed species, like cave bats, perish in collisions with facility turbines, NextEra Energy Resources or its subsidiaries could face criminal prosecution under these laws.\nNEE's and FPL's business could be negatively affected by federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of greenhouse gas emissions.\nFederal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide and methane, from electric generation units using fuels, such as natural gas. The potential effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on NEE's and FPL's electric generation units are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions, the relative availability of greenhouse gas emission reduction offsets, the development of cost-effective, commercial-scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures, and the range of available compliance alternatives.\nWhile NEE's and FPL's electric generation portfolio emits greenhouse gases at a lower rate of emissions than most of the U.S. electric generation sector, the results of operations of NEE and FPL could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state laws or regulations impose any new greenhouse gas emission limits. Any future limits on greenhouse gas emissions could:\n•\ncreate substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emissions allowances;\n•\nmake some of NEE's and FPL's electric generation units uneconomical to operate in the long term;\n•\nrequire significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology, fuel switching, or the replacement of high-emitting generation facilities with lower-emitting generation facilities; or\n•\naffect the availability or cost of fuel, such as natural gas.\nThere can be no assurance that NEE or FPL would be able to completely recover any such costs or investments, which could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nExtensive federal regulation of the operations and businesses of NEE and FPL exposes NEE and FPL to significant and increasing compliance costs and may also expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions for compliance failures.\nNEE's and FPL's operations and businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation, which generally imposes significant and increasing compliance costs on their operations and businesses. Additionally, any actual or alleged compliance failures could result in significant costs and other potentially adverse effects of regulatory investigations, proceedings, settlements, decisions and claims, including, among other items, potentially significant monetary penalties. As an example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, NEE and FPL, as owners and operators of bulk-power transmission systems and/or electric generation facilities, are subject to mandatory reliability standards. Compliance with these mandatory reliability standards may subject NEE and FPL to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. If FPL or NEE is found not to be in compliance with these standards, they may incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions. Both the costs of regulatory compliance and the costs that may be imposed as a result of any actual or alleged compliance failures could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n23\nChanges in tax laws, guidance or policies, including but not limited to changes in corporate income tax rates, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE's and FPL's provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities require significant judgments and the use of estimates. Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions and tax credits, including, but not limited to, estimates for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and the ability to utilize tax benefit carryforwards, such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Actual income taxes could vary significantly from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of, among other things, changes in tax laws, guidance or policies, including changes in corporate income tax rates, the issuance of guidance related to the qualification for renewable energy tax credits, the financial condition and results of operations of NEE and FPL, and the resolution of audit issues raised by taxing authorities. These factors, including the ultimate resolution of income tax matters, may result in material adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected due to adverse results of litigation.\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially affected by adverse results of litigation. Unfavorable resolution of legal or administrative proceedings in which NEE or FPL is involved or other future legal or administrative proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.\nAllegations of violations of law by FPL or NEE have the potential to result in fines, penalties, or other sanctions or effects, as well as cause reputational damage for FPL and NEE, and could hamper FPL’s and NEE’s effectiveness in interacting with governmental authorities.\nFPL’s and NEE’s business and reputation could be adversely affected by allegations that FPL or NEE has violated laws, by any investigations or proceedings that arise from such allegations, or by ultimate determinations of legal violations. For example, media articles have been published that allege, among other things, Florida state and federal campaign finance law violations by FPL. These articles are referenced in a complaint subsequently filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) that alleges certain violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act. FPL and NEE cannot guarantee that the FEC complaint process will not ultimately result in a finding that FPL or NEE violated federal campaign finance or other laws, that applicable federal or state governmental authorities may not investigate or take enforcement actions with respect to the allegations or assert that legal violations by FPL or NEE have occurred, or that violations may not ultimately be found by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authorities to have occurred.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the completion or pendency of any internal review or investigation by FPL or NEE of any allegations of legal violations, including of the allegations regarding campaign finance laws set forth in the media articles or FEC complaint, FPL and NEE cannot provide assurance that any of the foregoing will not result in the imposition of material fines, penalties, or otherwise result in other sanctions or effects on FPL or NEE, or will not have a material adverse impact on the reputation of NEE or FPL or on the effectiveness of their interactions with governmental regulators or other authorities.\nDevelopment and Operational Risks\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer if NEE and FPL do not proceed with projects under development or are unable to complete the construction of, or capital improvements to, electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities or other facilities on schedule or within budget.\nNEE's and FPL's ability to proceed with projects under development and to complete construction of, and capital improvement projects for, their electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities on schedule and within budget have been, in limited instances, and in the future may be, adversely affected by escalating costs for materials and labor and regulatory compliance, inability to obtain or renew necessary licenses, rights-of-way, permits or other approvals on acceptable terms or on schedule, disputes involving contractors, labor organizations, land owners, governmental entities, environmental groups, Native American and aboriginal groups, lessors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties, negative publicity, transmission interconnection issues, geopolitical factors, supply chain disruptions, inflation, rising interest rates and other factors. For example, the ability of NEE and FPL to develop solar generation facilities is dependent on the international supply chain for solar panels and associated equipment, and governmental or regulatory actions have caused minor, and could in the future cause material, disruptions in the ability of NEE and FPL to acquire solar panels on time and at acceptable costs. If any development project or construction or capital improvement project is not completed, is delayed or is subject to cost overruns, certain associated costs may not be approved for recovery or otherwise be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms that may be available, and NEE and FPL could become obligated to make delay or termination payments or become obligated for other damages under contracts, could experience the loss of tax credits or tax incentives, or delayed or diminished returns, and could be required to write off all or a portion of their investment in the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n24\nNEE and FPL face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities.\nNEE and FPL own, develop, construct, manage and operate electric generation and transmission facilities and natural gas transmission facilities. A key component of NEE's and FPL's growth is their ability to construct and operate generation and transmission facilities to meet customer needs. As part of these operations, NEE and FPL must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions. Should NEE or FPL be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances on NEE or FPL, NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third parties could have similar results.\nThe operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities are subject to many operational risks, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE's and FPL's electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities are subject to many operational risks. Operational risks could result in, among other things, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines for compliance failures or legal claims, liability to third parties for property and personal injury damage or loss of life, a failure to perform under applicable power sales agreements or other agreements and associated loss of revenues from terminated agreements or liability for liquidated damages under continuing agreements, and replacement equipment costs or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at higher prices.\nUncertainties and risks inherent in operating and maintaining NEE's and FPL's facilities include, but are not limited to:\n•\nrisks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned;\n•\nfailures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other necessary supplies;\n•\nthe impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme temperatures, icing events, wildfires, floods, severe convective storms, earthquakes and droughts;\n•\nperformance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency;\n•\nbreakdown or failure, including, but not limited to, explosions, fires, leaks or other major events, of equipment, transmission or distribution systems or pipelines;\n•\navailability of replacement equipment;\n•\nrisks of property damage, human injury or loss of life from energized equipment, hazardous substances or explosions, fires, leaks or other events, especially where facilities are located near populated areas;\n•\npotential environmental impacts of gas infrastructure operations;\n•\nrisks associated with potential harm to wildlife;\n•\navailability of adequate water resources and ability to satisfy water intake and discharge requirements;\n•\ninability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects in NEE's and FPL's facilities;\n•\nuse of new or unproven technology;\n•\nrisks associated with dependence on a specific type of fuel or fuel source, such as commodity price risk, availability of adequate fuel supply and transportation, and lack of available alternative fuel sources;\n•\nincreased competition due to, among other factors, new facilities, excess supply, shifting demand and regulatory changes (such as the passage of the IRA); and\n•\ninsufficient insurance, warranties or performance guarantees to cover any or all lost revenues or increased expenses from the foregoing.\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be negatively affected by a lack of growth, slower growth or a decline in the number of customers or in customer usage.\nGrowth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence the demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and power delivery facilities, as well as the need for energy-related commodities, such as natural gas. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of NEE and FPL, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, installation of distributed generation technologies and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation, inflation and the overall level of economic activity. A lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in customer demand for electricity or natural gas and other fuels may cause NEE and FPL to fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n25\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions and related impacts, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, droughts, extreme temperatures, icing events, wildfires, severe convective storms and earthquakes, can be destructive and cause power outages, personal injury and property damage, reduce revenue, affect the availability of fuel and water, and require NEE and FPL to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power, to access available financing sources, to obtain insurance, to pay for any associated injuries and damages and to fund any associated legal matters and compliance penalties. Furthermore, NEE's and FPL's physical plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, particularly relevant to FPL, a change in sea level. FPL operates in the east and lower west coasts of Florida and in northwest Florida, areas that historically have been prone to severe weather events, such as hurricanes. A disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent NEE and FPL from operating their business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. Additionally, the actions taken to address the potential for severe weather such as additional winterizing of critical equipment and infrastructure, modifying or alternating plant operations and expanding load shedding options could result in significant increases in costs. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAt FPL and other businesses of NEE where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service, to repair damaged facilities or for other actions to address severe weather is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, NEER's wind and solar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, NEER's results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically, and NEE's results of operations generally, may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. To the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected.\nThreats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from geopolitical factors, terrorism, cyberattacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt NEE's and FPL's business, or the businesses of third parties, may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE and FPL are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of geopolitical factors, terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyberattacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. There have been cyberattacks and other physical attacks within the energy industry on energy infrastructure such as substations, gas pipelines and related assets in the past and there may be such attacks in the future. In addition, the advancement of artificial intelligence has given rise to added vulnerabilities and potential entry points for cyberattacks. NEE's and FPL's generation, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems could be direct targets of, or otherwise be materially adversely affected by, such activities.\nGeopolitical factors, terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events affecting NEE's and FPL's systems and facilities, or those of third parties on which NEE and FPL rely, could harm NEE's and FPL's businesses by, for example, limiting their ability to generate, purchase, store or transmit power, natural gas or other energy-related commodities, limiting their ability to bill customers and collect and process payments, and delaying their development and construction of new generation, distribution, storage or transmission facilities or capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues, significant additional costs (for example, to repair assets, implement additional security requirements or maintain or acquire insurance), significant fines and penalties, and reputational damage, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's operations (for example, by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels), and could impair NEE's and FPL's ability to raise capital (for example, by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity). In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs. Such events or actions may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEE's and FPL's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses.\nInsurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be available at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to NEE and FPL. The ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, including\n26\nimpacts of actual or perceived climate-related events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. If NEE or FPL cannot or does not obtain insurance coverage, NEE or FPL may be required to pay costs associated with adverse future events.\nNEE and FPL generally are not fully insured against all significant losses. For example, NEE, including FPL, does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of its transmission and distribution property and natural gas pipeline assets. A loss for which NEE or FPL is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE invests in gas and oil producing and transmission assets through NEER’s gas infrastructure business. The gas infrastructure business is exposed to fluctuating market prices of natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and other energy commodities. A prolonged period of low gas and oil prices could impact NEER’s gas infrastructure business and cause NEER to delay or cancel certain gas infrastructure projects and could result in certain projects becoming impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNatural gas and oil prices are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally. Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, political instability, conflicts, new discoveries, technological advances, economic conditions and actions by major oil-producing countries. There can be significant volatility in market prices for gas and oil, and price fluctuations could have a material effect on the financial performance of gas and oil producing and transmission assets. For example, in a low gas and oil price environment, NEER would generate less revenue from its gas infrastructure investments in gas and oil producing properties, and as a result certain investments might become less profitable or incur losses. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could also result in the delay or cancellation of oil and gas production and transmission projects, could cause projects to experience lower returns, and could result in certain projects becoming impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf supply costs necessary to provide NEER's full energy and capacity requirement services are not favorable, operating costs could increase and materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEER provides full energy and capacity requirements\nservices primarily to distribution utilities, which include load-following services and various ancillary services, to satisfy all or a portion of such utilities' power supply obligations to their customers. The supply costs for these transactions may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, events that may occur after such utilities have committed to supply power, such as weather conditions, transmission constraints, fluctuating prices for, and locational disconnects in, energy and ancillary services, and the ability of the distribution utilities' customers to elect to receive service from competing suppliers. NEER may not be able to recover all of its increased supply costs, which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDue to the potential for significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and renewable and other energy commodities, NEER's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risks within its portfolios could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThere can be significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and renewable and other energy commodities, both in general and across geographies. NEE's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively its assets or positions against changes in commodity prices, volumes, interest rates, counterparty credit risk or other risk measures, based on factors that are either within, or wholly or partially outside of, NEE's control, may materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nReductions in the liquidity of energy markets may restrict the ability of NEE to manage its operational risks, which, in turn, could negatively affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE is an active participant in energy markets. Liquidity in energy markets can be described as the degree to which a product, such as electricity, gas or transmission rights, can be quickly bought or sold without significantly affecting its price and without incurring significant transaction costs. It can be driven in part by the number of active market participants and is an important factor in NEE's ability to manage risks in its participation in these markets. Liquidity in the energy markets can be adversely affected by price volatility, restrictions on the availability of credit, inflation, rising interest rates and other factors, and any reduction in the liquidity of energy markets could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE's and FPL's hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools may not protect against significant losses.\nNEE and FPL have hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools, such as separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. NEE and FPL are unable to assure that such procedures and tools will be effective against all potential risks, including, without limitation, employee misconduct or severe weather or operating conditions. If such procedures\n27\nand tools are not effective, this could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior, NEE's and FPL's risk management tools associated with their hedging and trading procedures may not protect against significant losses.\nNEE's and FPL's risk management tools and metrics associated with their hedging and trading procedures, such as daily value at risk, earnings at risk, stop loss limits and liquidity guidelines, are based on historical price movements. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from historical pricing behavior, NEE and FPL are unable to assure that their risk management tools and metrics will be effective to protect against material adverse effects on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf power transmission or natural gas, nuclear fuel or other commodity transportation facilities are unavailable or disrupted, the ability for subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, to sell and deliver power or natural gas may be limited.\nSubsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, depend upon power transmission and natural gas, nuclear fuel and other commodity transportation facilities, many of which they do not own. Occurrences affecting the operation of these facilities that may or may not be beyond the control of subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, (such as geopolitical factors, cyber incidents, physical attacks, severe weather or a generation or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, or sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind or solar generation) may limit or halt their ability to sell and deliver power and natural gas, or to purchase necessary fuels and other commodities, which could materially adversely impact NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from customers, hedging counterparties and vendors.\nNEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness and performance of their customers, hedging counterparties and vendors under contracts for the supply of equipment, materials, fuel and other goods and services required for their business operations and for the construction and operation of, and for capital improvements to, their facilities. Adverse conditions in the energy industry or the general economy such as inflation, as well as circumstances of individual customers, hedging counterparties and vendors, may adversely affect the ability of some customers, hedging counterparties and vendors to perform as required under their contracts with NEE and FPL.\nIf any vendor or hedging or other counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligations, NEE and FPL may need to make arrangements with other counterparties or vendors, which could result in material financial losses, higher costs, untimely completion of power generation facilities and other projects, and/or a disruption of their operations. If a defaulting counterparty is in poor financial condition, NEE and FPL may not be able to recover damages for any contract breach.\nNEE and FPL could recognize financial losses or a reduction in operating cash flows if a counterparty fails to perform or make payments in accordance with the terms of derivative contracts or if NEE or FPL is required to post margin cash collateral under derivative contracts.\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, some of which are traded in the OTC markets or on exchanges, to manage their commodity and financial market risks, and for NEE to engage in trading and marketing activities. Any failures by their counterparties to perform or make payments in accordance with the terms of those transactions could have a material adverse effect on NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similarly, any requirement for FPL or NEE to post margin cash collateral under its derivative contracts could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These risks may be increased during periods of adverse market or economic conditions such as inflation affecting the industry in which NEE and FPL participate.\nNEE and FPL are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems, and any failure or breach of those systems could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE and FPL operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite NEE's and FPL's implementation of security measures, all of their technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to such activities. If NEE's or FPL's information technology systems were to fail or be breached, sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised and NEE and FPL could be unable to fulfill critical business functions.\nNEE's and FPL's businesses are highly dependent on NEE's and FPL's ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and cross numerous and diverse markets. Due to the size, scope, complexity and geographical reach of NEE's and FPL's business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to keep track of and process information is critical and challenging. NEE's and FPL's operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are either within, or wholly or partially outside\n28\nof, their control, such as operator error, severe weather, geopolitical activities, terrorist activities or cyber incidents. Any such failure or disabling event could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's ability to process transactions and provide services, and their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE and FPL add, modify and replace information systems on a regular basis. Modifying existing information systems or implementing new or replacement information systems is costly and involves risks, including, but not limited to, integrating the modified, new or replacement system with existing systems and processes, implementing associated changes in accounting procedures and controls, and ensuring that data conversion is accurate and consistent. Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing information systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new information systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues and the diversion of management's and employees' attention and resources, and could negatively impact the effectiveness of the companies' control environment, and/or the companies' ability to timely file required regulatory reports.\nNEE and FPL also face the risks of operational failure or capacity constraints associated with the information systems of third parties, including, but not limited to, those who provide power transmission and natural gas transportation services.\nNEE's and FPL's retail businesses are subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in a material adverse impact to their reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.\nNEE's and FPL's retail businesses require access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business. NEE's and FPL's retail businesses may also need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center services, to the retail businesses. If a significant breach occurred, the reputation of NEE and FPL could be materially adversely affected, customer confidence could be diminished, or customer information could be subject to identity theft. NEE and FPL would be subject to costs associated with the breach and/or NEE and FPL could be subject to fines and legal claims, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.\nNEE and FPL could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of derivative instruments and limited liquidity in OTC markets.\nNEE and FPL execute transactions in derivative instruments on either recognized exchanges or via the OTC markets, depending on management's assessment of the most favorable credit and market execution factors. Transactions executed in OTC markets have the potential for greater volatility and less liquidity than transactions on recognized exchanges. As a result, NEE and FPL may not be able to execute desired OTC transactions due to such heightened volatility and limited liquidity.\nIn the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of derivative instruments involves management's judgment and use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these derivative instruments and have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity.\nFrom time to time, political and public sentiment may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting NEE and FPL. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to the negative publicity and any resulting investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can divert the time and effort of senior management from NEE's and FPL's business.\nAddressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of NEE and FPL, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with regulators. It may also have a negative impact on their ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected if FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in Florida.\nFPL may negotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in Florida to provide electric services within such municipalities and counties, and electricity sales generated pursuant to these agreements represent a very substantial portion of FPL's revenues. If FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate such franchise agreements on acceptable terms, it could contribute to lower earnings and FPL may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures, which could adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n29\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.\nEmployee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue and customers. Personnel costs may also increase due to inflationary or competitive pressures on payroll and benefits costs and revised terms of collective bargaining agreements with union employees. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the energy industry.\nNEE is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation of the energy industry. In addition, NEE may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely manner.\nNuclear Generation Risks\nThe operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental, health and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures.\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks, including, but not limited to, those relating to site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the disposition of spent nuclear fuel, leakage and emissions of tritium and other radioactive elements in the event of a nuclear accident or otherwise, the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of the facilities. NEE and FPL maintain decommissioning funds and external insurance coverage which are intended to reduce the financial exposure to some of these risks; however, the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities could exceed the amount available in NEE's and FPL's decommissioning funds, and the exposure to liability and property damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If NEE or FPL is unable to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or, in the case of FPL, through regulatory mechanisms, their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nIn the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, NEE and FPL could be assessed significant retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums as a result of their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies.\nLiability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains the maximum amount of private liability insurance obtainable, and participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides liability insurance coverage for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums, plus any applicable taxes, for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident. Such assessments, if levied, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNRC orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require NEE and FPL to incur substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear generation facilities and/or result in reduced revenues.\nThe NRC has broad authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear generation facilities, the addition of capacity at existing nuclear generation facilities and the construction of new nuclear generation facilities, and these requirements are subject to change. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down a nuclear generation facility, depending upon the NRC's assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Any of the foregoing events could require NEE and FPL to incur increased costs and capital expenditures, and could reduce revenues.\nAny serious nuclear incident occurring at a NEE or FPL plant could result in substantial remediation costs and other expenses. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear generation facility. An incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world also could cause the NRC to impose additional conditions or other requirements on the industry, or on certain types of nuclear generation units, which could increase costs, reduce revenues and result in additional capital expenditures.\n30\nThe\ninability to operate any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions could have a mater\nial adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation facilities are not operated for any reason through the life of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions, NEE or FPL may be required to increase depreciation rates, incur impairment charges and accelerate future decommissioning expenditures, any of which could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, and for other purposes. If planned outages last longer than anticipated or if there are unplanned outages, NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including, but not limited to, inspections, repairs and certain other modifications as well as to replace equipment. In the event that a scheduled outage lasts longer than anticipated or in the event of an unplanned outage due to, for example, equipment failure, such outages could materially adversely affect NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nLiquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets, among other factors, may negatively affect NEE's and FPL's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.\nNEE and FPL rely on access to capital and credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements, refinancing activities to support existing debt maturities and other requirements that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in those capital and credit markets, related to, among others, inflation, rising or sustained higher interest rates and geopolitical events, could increase NEE's and FPL's cost of capital and affect their ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs, to refinance existing indebtedness and to meet their growth objectives. If NEE or FPL is unable to access regularly the capital and credit markets on terms that are reasonable, it may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and incur an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to maintain and grow its business, could contribute to lower earnings and reduced financial flexibility, and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nAlthough NEE's competitive energy and certain other subsidiaries have used non-recourse or limited-recourse, project-specific or other financing in the past, market conditions, changes to regulatory capital requirements and other factors could adversely affect\nthe future availability of such financing. The inability of NEE's subsidiaries, including, without limitation, NEECH and its subsidiaries, to access the capital and credit markets to provide project-specific or other financing for electric generation or other facilities or acquisitions on favorable terms, whether because of disruptions or volatility in those markets or otherwise, could necessitate additional capital raising or borrowings by NEE and/or NEECH in the future and there can be no assurance that NEE or NEECH will have the ability to complete such borrowings.\nThe inability of subsidiaries that have existing project-specific or other financing arrangements to meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings, as well as actions by third parties or lenders, could give rise to a project-specific financing default which, if not cured or waived, might result in the specific project, and potentially in some limited instances its parent companies, being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated, and if such repayment were not made, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project assets and related collateral. Such an occurrence also could result in NEE expending additional funds or incurring additional obligations over the shorter term to ensure continuing compliance with project-specific financing arrangements based upon the expectation of improvement in the project's performance or financial returns over the longer term. Any of these actions could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects, as well as the availability or terms of future financings for NEE or its subsidiaries.\nNEE's, NEECH's and FPL's inability to maintain their current credit ratings may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's liquidity and results of operations, limit the ability of NEE and FPL to grow their business, and increase interest costs.\nThe inability of NEE, NEECH and FPL to maintain their current credit ratings could materially adversely affect their ability to raise capital or obtain credit on favorable terms, which, in turn, could impact NEE's and FPL's ability to grow their businesses and service indebtedness and refinance or repay borrowings, and would likely increase their interest costs. In addition, certain agreements and guarantee arrangements would require posting of additional collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade. Some of the factors that can affect credit ratings are cash flows, liquidity, the amount of debt as a component of total capitalization including rating agencies' treatment of certain indebtedness, NEE's overall business mix and political, legislative\n31\nand regulatory actions. There can be no assurance that one or more of the ratings of NEE, NEECH and FPL will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.\nNEE's and FPL's liquidity may be impaired if their credit providers are unable to fund their credit commitments to the companies or to maintain their current credit ratings.\nThe inability of NEE's, NEECH's and FPL's credit providers to fund their credit commitments or to maintain their current credit ratings could require NEE, NEECH or FPL, among other things, to renegotiate requirements in agreements, find an alternative credit provider with acceptable credit ratings to meet funding requirements, or post cash collateral and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's liquidity.\nPoor market performance and other economic factors could affect NEE's defined benefit pension plan's funded status, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. A decline in the market value of the assets held in the defined benefit pension plan due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for this obligation.\nNEE's defined benefit pension plan is sensitive to changes in interest rates, since as interest rates decrease, the funding liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefits costs and funding requirements. Any increase in benefits costs or funding requirements may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nPoor market performance and other economic factors could adversely affect the asset values of NEE's and FPL's nuclear decommissioning funds, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE and FPL are required to maintain decommissioning funds to satisfy their future obligations to decommission their nuclear power plants. A decline in the market value of the assets held in the decommissioning funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations. Any increase in funding requirements may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nCertain of NEE's investments are subject to changes in market value and other risks, which may materially adversely affect NEE's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nNEE holds certain investments where changes in the fair value affect NEE's financial results. In some cases there may be no observable market values for these investments, requiring fair value estimates to be based on other valuation techniques. This type of analysis requires significant judgment and the actual values realized in a sale of these investments could differ materially from those estimated. A sale of an investment below previously estimated value, or other decline in the fair value of an investment, could result in losses or the write-off of such investment, and may have a material adverse effect on NEE's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nNEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NEE.\nNEE is a holding company and, as such, has no material operations of its own. Substantially all of NEE's consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries. NEE's ability to meet its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, its guarantees, and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on its subsidiaries' net income and cash flows, which are subject to the risks of their respective businesses, and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to NEE.\nNEE's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no independent obligation to provide NEE with funds for its payment obligations. The subsidiaries have financial obligations, including, but not limited to, payment of debt service, which they must satisfy before they can provide NEE with funds. In addition, in the event of a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization, NEE's right to participate in a distribution of assets is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.\nThe dividend-paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding financing agreements and which may be included in future financing agreements. The future enactment of laws or regulations also may prohibit or restrict the ability of NEE's subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds.\nNEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if NEE is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries.\nNEE guarantees many of the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries, other than FPL, through guarantee agreements with NEECH. These guarantees may require NEE to provide substantial funds to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at\n32\na time when NEE is in need of liquidity to meet its own financial obligations. Funding such guarantees may materially adversely affect NEE's ability to meet its financial obligations or to pay dividends.\nNEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NEE’s limited partner interest in NEP OpCo.\nThrough an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, NEE owns a limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. NEP's inability to access capital on commercially reasonable terms when acquisitions, other growth opportunities or capital needs arise could have a material adverse effect on NEP's ability to deliver its cash distributions to its common unitholders, including NEE, and on the value of NEE’s limited partnership interest in NEP OpCo. In addition, NEP's issuance of additional common units or other securities in connection with acquisitions or the conversion of outstanding securities convertible into NEP common units could cause significant common unitholder dilution and reduce cash distributions to its common unitholders, including NEE.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may exert downward pressure on the market price of NEE's common stock.\nThe market price and trading volume of NEE's common stock are subject to fluctuations as a result of, among other factors, general credit and capital market conditions and changes in market sentiment regarding the operations, business and financing strategies of NEE, its subsidiaries and its affiliates, including NEP. As a result, disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may, for example, have a material adverse effect on the market price of NEE's common stock.\nWidespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEE’s and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nNEE and FPL are subject to the impacts of widespread public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, including, but not limited to, impacts on the global, national or local economy, capital and credit markets, NEE's and FPL's workforce, customers and suppliers. There is no assurance that NEE's and FPL's businesses will be able to operate without material adverse impacts depending on the nature of the public health crisis, epidemic or pandemic. The ultimate severity, duration and impact of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics cannot be predicted. Additionally, there is no assurance that vaccines, or other treatments, are or will be widely available or effective, or that the public will be willing to participate, in an effort to contain the spread of disease. Actions taken in response to such crises by federal, state and local government or regulatory agencies may have a material adverse impact on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects."

    "text": "Risk Management and Strategy\nCybersecurity risk management is included in NEE’s, including FPL’s, overall risk management program. NEE, including FPL, operates a cybersecurity program which, among other objectives, seeks to identify potential unauthorized occurrences on or conducted through the electronic information resources owned or used by NEE or FPL (information systems) that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of its information systems or any information residing on those systems (cybersecurity threats) as well as on its operations. The cybersecurity program includes controls to reduce the risk and potential impact of a cybersecurity incident and to align its processes, controls and implemented technologies with industry standard frameworks and regulations. In addition, outside experts assess NEE’s, including FPL’s, cybersecurity program capabilities, technology environment and security controls to regularly evaluate effectiveness.\nNEE, including FPL, operates a cybersecurity operations center and has cyber threat intelligence capability to identify, monitor, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats which is led by a cybersecurity incident response team. NEE, including FPL, uses these resources to identify cybersecurity threats and monitor for anomalies that may result in cybersecurity incidents on their systems, and monitors for impacts to external vendors or suppliers. Assessment of an incident includes, but is not limited to, analysis of the urgency and operational or business impact of an incident and the status and effectiveness of incident defenses. NEE, including FPL, invests in personnel and technologies with the objective of limiting the frequency and impact of cybersecurity incidents. Following documented cybersecurity incident response procedures, the cybersecurity incident response team escalates information about cybersecurity incidents as appropriate to oversight committees charged with managing specific aspects of cybersecurity risk, including, among others, the Cybersecurity and Resiliency Committee, the Cybersecurity Governance Executive Committee and NEE's Board of Directors.\nNEE, including FPL, conducts an annual internal cybersecurity drill with the participation from time to time of local, state and federal agencies to test its capability of dealing with a simulated cyber-attack. NEE, including FPL, also participates in industry\n33\nforums and trade groups, as well as in NERC activities to learn and apply these learnings to its cybersecurity policies and procedures.\nNEE, including FPL, uses third parties to periodically assess the extent to which its cybersecurity risk management protocols align with the DOE’s Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model standard. Certain functions within NEE, including FPL, are required to comply with certain regulatory standards that are designed to protect against cybersecurity incidents, including the NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection standards, as well as the NRC cybersecurity protection standards. Further, NEE, including FPL, has a cybersecurity training program and a mock phishing program to educate and train employees on potential cybersecurity risks and on privacy and data protection. Given geopolitical events, NEE, including FPL, continues to take steps to protect against cybersecurity threats to its critical infrastructure, including communications with its employees to ensure heightened awareness of increased cybersecurity threats worldwide.\nThe cybersecurity capabilities of third-party vendors providing system solutions to NEE or FPL or accessing NEE’s or FPL’s systems or data is evaluated as part of the new vendor establishment process. NEE, including FPL, retains the right to audit vendors for cybersecurity of products and services. Where applicable in NEE’s or FPL’s contracts with third-party vendors accessing its systems or data, standard data security terms and conditions are utilized and minimum amounts of insurance coverage based on the risk of exposure are required.\nNEE, including FPL, operates U.S. critical infrastructure. There have been cyberattacks and other physical attacks within the energy industry on energy infrastructure such as substations, gas pipelines and related assets in the past and there may be such attacks in the future. Although there have been no cybersecurity incidents or threats with a material impact on NEE’s nor FPL’s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, NEE's or FPL's information technology systems could fail or be breached, and such systems could be inoperable, causing NEE and FPL to be unable to fulfill critical business operations. The disclosures herein should be reviewed with the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A.\nGovernance\nThe chief information officer, the vice president, IT infrastructure and cybersecurity and the chief information security officer are responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats and have careers that represent more than 75 years of combined experience related to the management and protection of technologies. These individuals participate in or receive updates from not only the cybersecurity incident response team but also cybersecurity oversight committees, such as the Cybersecurity and Resiliency Committee comprised of various members of management, including the chief executive officers of FPL and NEER, the chief financial officer and the chief legal officer and the Cybersecurity Governance Executive Committee comprised of various members of management, including vice president of internal audit and executive director of emergency preparedness. These committees are charged with governing cybersecurity, cyber risks and resilience activities as well as the cyber and physical security policies and programs for NEE and its subsidiaries.\nNEE’s Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and receives cybersecurity reports from NEE’s chief information officer and its vice president, IT infrastructure and cybersecurity. The cybersecurity reports to the Board of Directors include various information, such as updates on the cybersecurity threat landscape, risk assessments, mitigation plans, including cyber defenses, notable incidents and a summary of the annual cyber drill results. Significant active cybersecurity incidents and threats are communicated to the Board of Directors as they occur."

    "text": "OVERVIEW\nNEE’s operating performance is driven primarily by the operations of its two principal businesses, FPL, which serves approximately 5.9 million customer accounts in Florida and is one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., and NEER, which together with affiliated entities is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun based on 2023 MWh produced on a net generation basis,\nas well as a world leader in battery storage\n. The table below presents net income (loss)\nattributable to NEE and\nearnings (loss) per s\nhare attributable to NEE, assuming dilution, by reportable segment, FPL and NEER.\nCorporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as other income and expense items, including interest expense, and eliminating entries, and may include the net effect of rounding.\nSee Note 16 for additional segment information.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein and all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year.\n______________________\n(a)    NEER’s results reflect an allocation of interest expense from NEECH based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries.\nFor the five years ended December 31, 2023, NEE delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 56.4%, compared to the S&P 500’s 107.2% return, the S&P 500 Utilities' 41.0% return and the Dow Jones U.S. Electricity's 39.6% return. The historical stock performance of NEE's common stock shown in the performance graph below is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.\n36\nAdjusted Earnings\nNEE prepares its financial statements under GAAP. However, management uses earnings adjusted for certain items (adjusted earnings), a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under NEE’s employee incentive compensation plans. NEE also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors.\nNEE\n’s management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NEE's fundamental earnings power. Although these amounts are properly reflected in the determination of net income under GAAP, management believes that the amount and/or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. Adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income, as prepared under GAAP.\nThe following table provides details of the after-tax adjustments to net income considered in computing NEE's adjusted earnings discussed above.\n______________________\n(a)\nFor 2023, 2022 and 2021, approximately $1,729 million of gains, $1,257 million of losses and $1,735 million of losses, respectively, are included in NEER's net income; the balance is included in Corporate and Other. The change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized.\n(b)\nSee Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of an impairment charge related to the investment in NEP in 2023.\n(c)\nApproximately $300 million of gains are included in FPL's net income; the balance is included in NEER. See Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests for a discussion of the sale of FPL's ownership interest in its Florida City Gas business (FCG).\n(d)\nSee Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the impairment charge in 2022 related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (Mountain Valley Pipeline).\nNEE segregates into two categories unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative transactions. The first category, referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected or has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to certain of the positions are generally not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. The second category, referred to as trading activities, which is included in adjusted earnings, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities. At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n2023 Summary\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2023 was higher than 2022 by $3,163 million, or $1.50 per share, assuming dilution, due to higher results at NEER and FPL, partly offset by lower results at Corporate and Other.\nFPL's net income increased by $851 million in 2023 primarily driven by continued investments in plant in service and other property and the gain on sale of FPL's ownership interest in the FCG business.\nNEER's results increased in 2023 primarily driven by favorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2022, higher earnings from new investments, lower impairment charges related to its investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, partly offset by the OTTI impairment related to the investment in NEP. In 2023, NEER added approximately 1,651 MW of new wind generating capacity and 2,073 MW of solar generating capacity and increased its backlog of contracted renewable development projects.\nCorporate and Other's results in 2023 decreased primarily due to unfavorable non-qualifying hedge activity.\n37\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are primarily provided by cash flows from operations, borrowings or issuances of short- and long-term debt and, from time to time, issuances of equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors, the sale of tax credits and sales of assets to NEP or third parties. See Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2023 was $7.31 billion compared to $4.15 billion in 2022. In 2023, net income attributable to NEE increased primarily due to higher results at NEER and FPL, partly offset by lower results at\nCorporate and Other. The comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31,\n2022\nand 2021 are included in Management's Discussion in NEE's and FPL's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2022\n.\nIn September 2022, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold to a NEP subsidiary a 67% controlling ownership interest in a battery storage facility with storage capacity of 230 MW. In December 2022, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold (i) a 49% controlling ownership interest in three wind generation facilities and one solar plus battery facility with a total generating capacity of 1,437 MW and 65 MW of battery storage capacity, two of which facilities were under construction and achieved commercial operations in 2023, and (ii) their 100% ownership interest in three wind generation facilities with a total generating capacity of 347 MW to a NEP subsidiary. See Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests.\nIn March 2023, a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources acquired a portfolio of renewable energy projects as well as the related service provider. See Note 6 – RNG Acquisition. In June 2023, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold to a NEP subsidiary their 100% ownership interests in five wind generation facilities and three solar generation facilities with a total generating capacity of 688 MW. In November 2023, FPL sold its ownership interests in FCG. See Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests.\nNEE's effective income tax rate for\n2023\nand\n2022\nwas approximately 14% and 15%, respectively. The rates for both years reflect the impact of renewable energy tax credits. See Note 5. In August 2022, the IRA was enacted which significantly expanded tax incentives for clean energy (see Item 1. Business – NEER – Clean Energy and Other Operations – Clean Energy – Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects).\nFPL: Results of Operations\nFPL obtains its operating revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established by the FPSC through b\nase rates and cost recovery clause mechanisms. FPL’s net income for 2023 and 2022 was $4,552 million and $3,701 million, respectively, representing an increase of $851 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher earnings from investments in plant in service and other property and the gain on sale of FPL's ownership interest in the FCG business. Such investments grew FPL's average rate base by approximately $6.9 billion in 2023 and reflect, among other things, solar generation additions, ongoing transmission and distribution additions, and the addition of the 1,246 MW Dania Beach Clean Energy Center which was placed in service on May 31, 2022.\nDuring 2023, the FPSC approved FPL's request to begin recovering eligible storm costs of approximately $1.3 billion, primarily related to surcharges for Hurricanes Ian and Nicole which impacted FPL's service area in 2022. FPL implemented an interim storm restoration charge in April 2023 for eligible storm restoration costs. See Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\nThe use of reserve amortization is permitted by the 2021 rate agreement. See Item 1. Business – FPL – FPL Regulation – FPL Electric Rate Regulation – Base Rates – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 for additional information on the 2021 rate agreement. In order to earn a targeted regulatory ROE, subject to limitations associated with the 2021 rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items must be adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. In certain periods, reserve amortization is reversed so as not to exceed the targeted regulatory ROE. The drivers of FPL's net income not reflected in the reserve amortization calculation typically include wholesale and transmission service revenues and expenses, cost recovery clause revenues and expenses, AFUDC – equity and revenue and costs not recoverable from retail customers. FPL recorded reserve amortization of approximately $227 million in 2023 and a one-time reserve amortization adjustment of $114 million in 2022. See Depreciation and Amortization Expense below. FPL's regulatory ROE for 2023 and 2022 was approximately 11.80% and 11.74%, respectively.\nOn September 28, 2023, the Florida Supreme Court ruled on the appeal of the FPSC’s final order regarding FPL’s 2021 rate agreement and remanded the FPSC's order back to the FPSC. See Note 1 – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025.\n38\nDuring 2023, operating revenues increased $1,083 million primarily related to an increase in storm cost recovery revenues as discussed in Cost Recovery Clauses below.\nRetail Base\nFPL’s retail base revenues for 2023 and 2022 reflect the 2021 rate agreement. Retail base revenues increased approximately $618 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily related to new retail base rates under the 2021 rate agreement. Retail revenues were also impacted by an increase of approximately 1.2% in the average number of customer accounts, partly offset by a decrease of 0.6% in the average usage per retail customer. See Note 1 – Rate Regulation.\nCost Recovery Clauses\nRevenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass-through costs, such as franchise fees, revenue taxes and storm-related surcharges, are largely a pass-through of costs. Such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery clauses on certain assets, primarily related to certain solar, environmental projects, storm protection plan investments and the unamortized balance of the regulatory asset associated with FPL's acquisition of certain generation facilities. See Item 1. Business – FPL – FPL Regulation – FPL Electric Rate Regulation – Cost Recovery Clauses. Under-recovery or over-recovery of cost recovery clause and other pass-through costs (deferred clause and franchise expenses and revenues) can significantly affect NEE's and FPL's operating cash flows. The 2023 net decrease in under-recovery of cost recovery clauses impacting FPL's operating cash flows was approximately $1,104 million, primarily related to lower fuel prices and recovery of fuel cost incurred in 2022, but recovered in rates in 2023.\nThe increase in operating revenues in 2023 reflects higher storm cost recovery revenues of approximately $1,117 million primarily associated with Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as discussed above. The increase in operating revenues in 2023 were partly offset by decreases in fuel cost recovery revenues of approximately $714 million primarily as a result of lower fuel and energy prices. In 2023 and 2022, cost recovery clauses contributed approximately $369 million and $261 million, respectively, to FPL’s net income.\nOther Items Impacting FPL's Consolidated Statements of Income\nFuel, Purchase Power and Interchange Expense\nFuel, purchased power and interchange expense decreased $927 million in 2023 primarily related to lower fuel and energy prices.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nThe major components of FPL’s depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:\nDepreciation expense increased $1,094 million during 2023 primarily reflecting amortization of deferred storm costs expenses primarily associated with Hurricanes Ian and Nicole as discussed above, of approximately $1,114 million, partly offset by the impact of reserve amortization. In 2022, FPL recorded a one-time reserve amortization adjustment of approximately $114 million as required under the 2021 rate agreement, 50% of which was used to reduce the capital recovery regulatory asset balance and the other 50% to increase the storm reserve regulatory liability. Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2021 rate agreement in order to achieve the targeted regulatory ROE. Reserve amortization is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2023, approximately $1,223 million of reserve amortization remains available under the 2021 rate agreement.\nGains on Disposal of Businesses/Assets – net\nIn 2023, gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net primarily relate to the sale of ownership interests in the FCG business. See Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased\n$346 million\nprimarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances.\n39\nNEER: Results of Operations\nNEER owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets in the U.S. and Canada and also includes assets and investments in other businesses with a clean energy focus, such as battery storage and renewable fuels. NEER also provides full energy and capacity requirements services, engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities, owns, develops, constructs and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines and invests in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production and pipeline infrastructure assets. NEER’s net income less net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2023 and 2022 was $3,558 million and $285 million, respectively, resulting in an increase in 2023 of $3,273 million. The primary drivers, on an after-tax basis, of the change are in the following table.\n______________________\n(a)    Reflects after-tax project contributions, including the net effect of deferred income taxes and other benefits associated with renewable energy tax credits for wind, solar and storage projects, as applicable (see Note 1 – Income Taxes and – Noncontrolling Interests and Note 5), but excludes allocation of interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses except for an allocated credit support charge related to guarantees issued to conduct business activities. Results from projects, pipelines and rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation or ownership. Project results, including repowered wind projects, are included in existing clean energy, pipeline results are included in gas infrastructure and rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines are included in NEET beginning with the thirteenth month of operation or ownership.\n(b)    Excludes allocation of interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses except for an allocated credit support charge related to guarantees issued to conduct business activities.\n(c)    See Overview – Adjusted Earnings for additional information.\n(d)    See Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the first quarter 2022 impairment charge related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline.\nNew Investments\nResults from new investments in 2023 increased primarily due to higher earnings related to new wind and solar generation and battery storage facilities that entered service during or after 2022.\nOther Factors\nSupplemental to the primary drivers of the changes in NEER's results discussed above, the discussion below describes changes in certain line items set forth in NEE's consolidated statements of income as they relate to NEER.\nOperating Revenues\nOperating revenues for 2023 increased $5,952 million primarily due to:\n•\nthe impact of non-qualifying commodity hedges due primarily to changes in energy prices (approximately $2,529 million of gains during 2023 compared to $2,670 million of losses for 2022),\n•\nnet increases in revenues of $647 million from the customer supply and gas infrastructure businesses,\n•\nrevenues from new investments of $390 million, and\n•\nhigher revenues from NEET of $84 million,\npartly offset by,\n•\nlower revenues from existing clean energy assets of $371 million primarily due to lower wind revenues primarily reflecting lower wind resource.\nOperating Expenses\n–\nnet\nOperating expenses – net for 2023 increased $566 million primarily due to increases of $342 million in O&M expenses and $287 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, partly offset by decreases of $41 million in fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses. The increases were primarily associated with growth across the NEER businesses.\nGains on Disposal of Businesses/Assets\n–\nnet\nIn 2022, gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net primarily relate to the sale of ownership interests in wind, solar and battery\n40\nstorage projects to NEP and the resolution of a contingency related to the December 2021 sale of ownership interests in wind and solar projects. See Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests.\nInterest Expense\nNEER's interest expense for 2023 increased $1,001 million primarily reflecting approximately $617 million of unfavorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments as well as higher interest expense primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees\nNEER recognized $649 million of equity in losses of equity method investees in 2023 compared to $202 million of equity in earnings of equity method investees for the prior year. The decrease in 2023 primarily reflects an impairment charge of approximately $1.2 billion ($0.9 billion after tax) related to the investment in NEP and a decrease in equity in earnings (losses) of NEP recorded in 2023 primarily due to unfavorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments, partly offset by the absence of impairment charges of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax) related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline recorded in the first quarter of 2022 (see Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements).\nChange in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities Held in NEER's Nuclear Decommissioning Funds – net\nIn 2023, the changes in the fair value of equity securities in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds related to favorable market conditions in 2023 compared to unfavorable market conditions in the prior year.\nIncome Taxes\nNEER's effective income tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was approximately 7% and 39%, respectively, and is primarily based on the composition of pretax income in 2023 and pretax loss in 2022 as well as the impact of renewable energy tax credits. PTCs from wind and solar projects and ITCs from solar, battery storage and certain wind projects are included in NEER’s earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind and solar energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. See Note 1 – Income Taxes for a discussion of renewable energy tax credits, Note 5 and Note 16.\nCorporate and Other: Results of Operations\nCorporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating res\nults of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to\nNextEra Energy Resources. Interest expense is allocated based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries.\nCorporate and Other's results decreased $961 million during\n2023\nprimarily due to unfavorable after-tax impacts of approximately $793 million, as compared to the prior year, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments as well as higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital (see Note 1\n– Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery\n), capital expenditures (see Note 15\n–\nCommitments), investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses (see Note 6), payment of maturing debt and related derivative obligations (see Note 13 and Note 3) and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt (see Note 13) and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors, the sale of renewable energy tax credits (see Note 1 - Income Taxes) and sales of assets to NEP or third parties (see Note 1\n–\nDisposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests)\n, consistent with NEE’s and FPL’s objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating.\nNEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.\nIn October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $150 million of common units representing limited partner interests in NEP. Under the program, purchases may be made in amounts, at prices and at such times as NEE or its subsidiaries deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Any purchases will be made in such quantities, at such prices, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as determined by NEE or its subsidiaries in their discretion, based on factors such as market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common unit purchase program does not require NEE to acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated by NEE at any time. The purpose of the program is not to cause NEP’s common units to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange or to cause the common units to be deregistered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2023, the dollar value of units that may yet be purchased by NEE under this program was $114 million. At December 31, 2023, NEE owned a noncontrolling general partner interest in NEP and beneficially owned approximately 52.6% of NEP’s voting power.\n41\nCash Flows\nNEE's sources and uses of cash for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nFor significant financing activity that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2023, see Note 13.\nNEE's primary capital requirements are for expanding and enhancing FPL's electric system and generation facilities to continue to provide reliable service to meet customer electricity demands and for funding NEER's investments in independent power and other projects.\nSee Note 15 – Commitments for estimated capital expenditures in 2024 through 2028.\nThe following table provides a summary of capital investments for\n2023\n,\n2022\nand\n2021\n.\n42\nLiquidity\nAt December 31, 2023, NEE's total net available liquidity was approximately $12.2 billion. The table below provides the components of FPL's and NEECH's net available liquidity at December 31, 2023.\n______________________\n(\na)    Provide for the funding of loans up to the amount of the credit facility and the issuance of letters of credit up to $3,200 million ($450 million for FPL and $2,750 million for NEECH). The entire amount of the credit facilities is available for general corporate purposes and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies’ or their subsidiaries’ operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss). FPL’s syndicated revolving credit facilities are also available to support the purchase of $1,319 million of pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds in the event they are tendered by individual bondholders and not remarketed prior to maturity as well as the repayment of approximately $1,812 million of floating rate notes in the event an individual noteholder requires repayment at specified dates prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $3,311 million of NEECH's syndicated revolving credit facilities expire over the next 12 months.\n(b)    Only available for the funding of loans. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $205 million of FPL's and $650 million of NEECH's bilateral revolving credit facilities expire over the next 12 months. See Note 13 regarding increases in capacity and borrowings subsequent to December 31, 2023.\n(c)    Only available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $500 million of the letter of credit facilities expire over the next 12 months.\nApproximately 71 banks, located globally, participate in FPL’s and NEECH’s revolving credit facilities, with no one bank providing more than 5% of the combined revolving credit facilities. Pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement, NEE guarantees the payment of NEECH’s debt obligations under its revolving credit facilities. In order for FPL or NEECH to borrow or to have letters of credit issued under the terms of their respective revolving credit facilities and, also for NEECH, its letter of credit facilities, FPL, in the case of FPL, and NEE, in the case of NEECH, are required, among other things, to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that does not exceed a stated ratio. The FPL and NEECH revolving credit facilities also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, failure of FPL and NEE, as the case may be, to maintain the respective ratio of funded debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio. At December 31, 2023, each of NEE and FPL was in compliance with its required ratio.\nCapital Support\nGuarantees, Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Indemnifications (Guarantee Arrangements)\nCertain subsidiaries of NEE issue guarantees and obtain letters of credit and surety bonds, as well as provide indemnities, to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. Substantially all of the guarantee arrangements are on behalf of NEE’s consolidated subsidiaries, as discussed in more detail below. See Note 8 regarding guarantees of obligations on behalf of NEP subsidiaries. NEE is not required to recognize liabilities associated with guarantee arrangements issued on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that they will be required to perform. At December 31, 2023, NEE believes that there is no material exposure related to these guarantee arrangements.\nNEE subsidiaries issue guarantees related to equity contribution agreements and engineering, procurement and construction agreements, associated with the development, construction and financing of certain power generation facilities (see Note 1 - Structured Payables) and a natural gas pipeline project under construction, as well as a related natural gas transportation agreement. Commitments associated with these activities are included and/or disclosed in the contracts table in Note 15.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2023, NEE subsidiaries had approximately $6.1 billion in guarantees related to obligations under PPAs and acquisition agreements, nuclear-related activities, payment obligations related to PTCs, support for NEER's retail electricity provider activities, as well as other types of contractual obligations (see Note 15 – Commitments).\n43\nIn some instances, subsidiaries of NEE elect to issue guarantees instead of posting other forms of collateral required under certain financing arrangements, as well as for other project-level cash management activities. At December 31, 2023, these guarantees totaled approximately $1.2 billion and support, among other things, cash management activities, including those related to debt service and operations and maintenance service agreements, as well as other specific project financing requirements.\nSubsidiaries of NEE also issue guarantees to support customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading activities, including the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities. At December 31, 2023, the estimated mark-to-market exposure (the total amount that these subsidiaries of NEE could be required to fund based on energy commodity market prices at December 31, 2023) plus contract settlement net payables, net of collateral posted for obligations under these guarantees totaled approximately $1.8 billion.\nAt December 31, 2023, subsidiaries of NEE also had approximately $5.1 billion of standby letters of credit and approximately $1.6 billion of surety bonds to support certain of the commercial activities discussed above. FPL's and NEECH's credit facilities are available to support substantially all of the standby letters of credit.\nIn addition, as part of contract negotiations in the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of NEE have agreed and in the future may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties, including those associated with asset divestitures, for possible unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may include, but are not limited to, an adverse judgment in a lawsuit, or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretations of the tax law. NEE is unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments by its subsidiaries under some of these contracts because events that would obligate them to make payments have not occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence.\nNEECH, a 100% owned subsidiary of NEE, provides funding for, and holds ownership interests in, NEE's operating subsidiaries other than FPL. NEE has fully and unconditionally guaranteed certain payment obligations of NEECH, including most of its debt and all of its debentures registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications, and NEECH has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of subsidiaries within the NEER segment. Certain guarantee arrangements described above contain requirements for NEECH and FPL to maintain a specified credit rating. For a discussion of credit rating downgrade triggers, see Credit Ratings below.\nNEE fully and unconditionally guarantees NEECH debentures pursuant to a guarantee agreement, dated as of June 1, 1999 (1999 guarantee) and NEECH junior subordinated debentures pursuant to an indenture, dated as of September 1, 2006 (2006 guarantee). The 1999 guarantee is an unsecured obligation of NEE and ranks equally and ratably with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of NEE. The 2006 guarantee is unsecured and subordinate and junior in right of payment to NEE senior indebtedness (as defined therein). No payment on those junior subordinated debentures may be made under the 2006 guarantee until all NEE senior indebtedness has been paid in full in certain circumstances. NEE’s and NEECH’s ability to meet their financial obligations are primarily dependent on their subsidiaries’ net income, cash flows and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to NEE and NEECH. The dividend-paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding financing agreements.\n44\nSummarized financial information of NEE and NEECH is as follows:\n______________________\n(a)    Excludes intercompany transactions, and investments in, and equity in earnings of, subsidiaries.\n(b)    Information has been prepared on the same basis of accounting as NEE's consolidated financial statements.\nShelf Registration\nIn March 2021, NEE, NEECH and FPL filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of securities, which became effective upon filing. The amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective boards of directors. Securities that may be issued under the registration statement include, depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debentures, first mortgage bonds, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, warrants and guarantees related to certain of those securities.\n45\nCredit Ratings\nNEE’s liquidity, ability to access credit and capital markets, cost of borrowings and collateral posting requirements under certain agreements is dependent on its and its subsidiaries credit ratings. At February 16, 2024, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s), S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to NEE, FPL and NEECH:\n_________________________\n(a)    A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.\n(b)    The outlook indicated by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch is stable.\n(c)    Short-term ratings are presented as all bonds outstanding are currently paying a short-term interest rate. At FPL's election, a portion or all of the bonds may be adjusted to a long-term interest rate.\nNEE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt. A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities noted above, the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities.\nCommitment fees and interest rates on loans under these credit facilities’ agreements are tied to credit ratings. A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and borrowings and additional or replacement credit facilities. In addition, a ratings downgrade could result in, among other things, the requirement that NEE subsidiaries post collateral under certain agreements and guarantee arrangements, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel procurement, power sales and purchases, nuclear decommissioning funding, debt-related reserves and trading activities. FPL’s and NEECH’s credit facilities are available to support these potential requirements.\nCovenants\nNEE's charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter, the ability of NEE to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries. For example, FPL pays dividends to NEE in a manner consistent with FPL's long-term targeted capital structure. However, the mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to NEE and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds. Additionally, in some circumstances, the mortgage restricts the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPL's use of retained earnings. At December 31, 2023, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage and, in light of FPL's current financial condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations.\nFPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, wh\nich generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPL’s first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and all indebtedness of FPL that ranks prior or equal to the first mortgage bonds. At December 31, 2023, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023 would have been approximately 9.6 times the annual interest requirements and approximately 4.1 times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee. At December 31, 2023, FPL could have issued in excess of $34 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and retired first mortgage bonds. At December 31, 2023, no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes.\n46\nIn September 2006, NEE and NEECH executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (as amended, September 2006 RCC) in connection with NEECH's offering of $350 million principal amount of Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (Series B junior subordinated debentures). The September 2006 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long-term indebtedness (covered debt) of NEECH (other than the Series B junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of NEE. NEECH's 3.50% Debentures, Series due April 1, 2029 have been designated as the covered debt under the September 2006 RCC. The September 2006 RCC provides that NEECH may redeem, and NEE or NEECH may purchase, any Series B junior subordinated debentures on or before October 1, 2036, only to the extent that the redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount of proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities, subject to certain limitations described in the September 2006 RCC. Qualifying securities are securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the Series B junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption or purchase, which are sold within 365 days prior to the date of the redemption or repurchase of the Series B junior subordinated debentures.\nIn June 2007, NEE and NEECH executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (as amended, June 2007 RCC) in connection with NEECH's offering of $400 million principal amount of its Series C Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (Series C junior subordinated debentures). The June 2007 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of covered debt of NEECH (other than the Series C junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of NEE. NEECH's 3.50% Debentures, Series due April 1, 2029 have been designated as the covered debt under the June 2007 RCC. The June 2007 RCC provides that NEECH may redeem or purchase, or satisfy, discharge or defease (collectively, defease), and NEE and any majority-owned subsidiary of NEE or NEECH may purchase, any Series C junior subordinated debentures on or before June 15, 2037, only to the extent that the principal amount defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount raised from the issuance, during the 365 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the Series C junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations described in the June 2007 RCC.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nNEE’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared under GAAP. Critical accounting policies are those that NEE believes are both most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nNEE considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements:\nAccounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nNEE\nuses derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets and engages in power and\nfuel\nmarketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements.\nNature of Accounting Estimates\nAccounting pronouncements require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, which may require significant judgment to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. This applies not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying derivatives accounting guidance to contracts. In the event changes in interpretation occur, it is possible that contracts that currently are excluded from derivatives accounting rules would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in the statement of income.\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value using a combination of market and income approaches. Fair values for some of the longer-term contracts where liquid markets are not available are derived through the use of industry-standard valuation techniques, such as internally developed models which estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices. Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date.\nThe near-term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes. However, in the later years, the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the\n47\npurchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. NEE estimates the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing\nthe net amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the derivative agreements. The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.\nAt FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the\nfuel clause\n. See Note 3.\nIn NEE’s non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives’ fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees’ related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income.\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE estimates the fair value of these derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing observable inputs.\nCertain derivative transactions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting has been discontinued.\nChanges in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings and could be significant to NEER’s results because the economic offset to the positions are not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE’s management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Overview and Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity.\nAccounting for Pension Benefits\nNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. Management believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well-funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefits under the plan. NEE allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.\nNature of Accounting Estimates\nFor the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value, as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including an estimate of the average remaining life of employees/survivors as well as the average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. NEE derives pension income from actuarial calculations based on the plan’s provisions and various management assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nAccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.\n48\nNet periodic pension income is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 include:\nIn developing these assumptions, NEE evaluated input, including other qualitative and quantitative factors, from its actuaries and consultants, as well as information available in the marketplace. Discount rates are established using the full yield curve approach. In addition, for the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, NEE considered different models, capital market return assumptions and historical returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to\nits pension fund, as well as its pension fund's historical compounded returns.\nNEE will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as appropriate.\nNEE utilizes in its determination of pension income a market-related valuation of plan assets. This market-related valuation reduces year-to-year volatility and recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period following the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of plan assets and the actual return realized on those plan assets. Since the market-related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of plan assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension income only to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market-related value of plan assets.\nThe following table illustrates the effect on net periodic pension income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant:\nNEE also utilizes actuarial assumptions about mortality to help estimate obligations of the pension plan. NEE has adopted the latest revised mortality tables and mortality improvement scales released by the Society of Actuaries, which did not have a material impact on the pension plan's obligation.\nSee Note 12.\nCarrying Value of Long-Lived Assets\nNEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nNature of Accounting Estimates\nThe amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events. In particular, the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long-lived asset, the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized.\n49\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nAn impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset’s fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate.\nCarrying Value of Equity Method Investments\nNEE tests its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value\n.\nNature of Accounting Estimates\nIndicators of impairment may include, but are not limited to, a series of operating losses of an investee, the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity and a current fair value of an investment that may be less than its carrying value. If indicators of impairment exist, an estimate of the investment’s fair value will be calculated. Approaches for estimating fair value include, among others, an income approach using a probability-weighted discounted cash flows model, a market approach using an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple model, and a market observable transaction. The probability assigned to each scenario as well as the cash flows and EBITDA multiple identified are critical in determining fair value.\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nAn impairment loss is required to be recognized if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Assessment of whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired involves, among other factors, consideration of the length of time that the fair value is below the carrying value, current expected performance relative to the expected performance when the investment was initially made, performance relative to peers, industry performance relative to the economy, credit rating, regulatory actions and legal and permitting challenges. If management is unable to reasonably assert that an impairment is temporary or believes that there will not be full recovery of the carrying value of its investment, then the impairment is considered to be other than temporary. Investments that are other than temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated fair value and cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value. Impairment losses are recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\nDecommissioning and Dismantlement\nNEE accounts for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets.\nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities.\nNature of Accounting Estimates\nThe calculation of the future cost of retiring long-lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement costs, involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate with inflation. In addition, NEE also makes interest rate and rate of return projections on its investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Periodically, NEE is required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed escalation rates for nuclear decommissioning costs would increase NEE’s AROs at December 31, 2023 by approximately\n$93 million.\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nFPL\n–\nFor ratemaking purpos\nes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are approved by the FPSC. The most recent studies, filed in 2020, reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL’s nuclear units at the time of the studies. FPL’s portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $9.4 billion, or $2.5 billion expressed in 2023 dollars. The ultimate costs of decommissioning reflect the applications submitted to the NRC for the extension of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 and St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 licenses for an additional 20 years.\n50\nFPL accrues the cost of dismantling its other generation plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC. Unlike nuclear decommissioning, dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies became effective January 1, 2022. At December 31, 2023, FPL’s portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its other generation units is approximately $2.4 billion, or $1.2 billion expressed in 2023 dollars. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not reported as AROs. FPL accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. Any differences between the amount of the ARO\nand the amount recorded for ratemaking purposes are reported as a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with regulatory accounting.\nThe components of FPL’s decommissioning of nuclear plants, dismantlement of plants and other accrued asset removal costs are as follows:\n______________________\n(a)    See Note 11.\n(b)    Included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE’s and FPL’s consolidated balance sheets, except for $1,021 million and\n$532 million which are related to interim removal costs and are included in noncurrent regulatory assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 1 – Rate Regulation.\n(c)    Included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets, except for $14 million and\n$38 million\nwhich are related to other generation plant dismantlement and are included in noncurrent regulatory assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(d)    Represents total amount accrued for ratemaking purposes.\nNEER\n–\nNEER records liabilities for the present value of its expected nuclear plant decommissioning costs which are determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning. The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n, the AROs for decommissioning of NEER’s nuclear plants approximate\nd $607 million and\n$\n604 million, respectively. NEER’s portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approxima\ntely $9.8 billion, or $2.2 billion ex\npressed in 2023 dollars.\nSee Note 1\n–\nAsset Retirement Obligations and\n–\nDecommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs and Note 11.\nRegulatory Accounting\nCertain of NEE's businesses are subject to rate regulation which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1\n–\nRate Regulation for details regarding NEE’s regulatory assets and liabilities.\nNature of Accounting Estimates\nRegulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn (pay) a return on investment during the recovery period.\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nAccounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. If NEE's rate-regulated entities, primarily FPL, were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the regulators, including the FPSC for FPL, have the authority to disallow recovery of costs that they consider excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when generation facilities are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. The continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period.\n51\nENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING AND MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY\nNEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices.\nFinancial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NEE and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year.\nManagement has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks, as well as credit risks.\nCommodity Price Risk\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n–\nAccounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities and Note 3.\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the changes in the fair value of NEE’s consolidated subsidiaries’ energy contract derivative instruments were as follows:\nNEE’s total mark-to-market energy contract net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2023 shown above are included on the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\n52\nThe sources of fair value estimates and maturity of energy contract derivative instruments at December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nWith respect to commodities, NEE’s Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management, and NEE's chief executive officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The EMC and NEE's chief executive officer receive periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities.\nNEE uses a value-at-risk (VaR) model to measure commodity price market risk in its trading and mark-to-market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated loss of market value based on a one-day holding period at a 95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology. The VaR figures are as follows:\n______________________\n(a)    The VaR figures for the trading portfolio include positions that are marked to market. Taking into consideration offsetting unmarked non-derivative positions, such as physical inventory, the trading VaR figures were approximately $1 million and $18 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(b)    Non-qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non-qualifying hedges and hedges in FPL cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nNEE's and FPL's financial results are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective outstanding a\nnd expected future issuances of d\nebt, investments in special use funds and other investments. NEE and FPL manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate contracts and using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Interest rate contracts are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements.\n53\nThe following are estimates of the fair value of NEE's and FPL's financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk:\n______________________\n(a)    See Note 3 and Note 4.\nThe special use funds of NEE and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of NEE's and FPL's nuclear power plants. See Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities primarily carried at estimated fair value. At FPL, changes in fair value, including any credit losses, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment. The changes in fair value for NEE's non-rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income, except for credit losses and unrealized losses on available for sale securities intended or required to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are reported in current period earnings. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer-term securities.\nAt December 31, 2023, NEE had interest rate contracts with a net notional amount of approximately $25.6 billion to manage exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily associated with expected future and outstanding debt issuances at NEECH and NEER. In January 2024, NEECH entered into a $4.0 billion interest rate contract which reduced the net notional amount. See Note 3.\nBased upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, the fair value of NEE’s net liabilities would increase by approxim\nately $2,705 million ($1,093 million f\nor FPL) at December 31, 2023.\nEquity Price Risk\nNEE and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in prices for equity securities. For example, NEE’s nuclear decommissioning reserve funds include marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately $5,290 million and $4,437 million ($3,536 million and $2,905 million for FPL) at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. NEE's and FPL’s investment strategy for equity securities in their nuclear decommissioning reserve funds emphasizes marketable securities which are broadly diversified. At December 31, 2023, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted on stock exchanges would result in an approximately $494 million ($322 million for FPL) reduction in fair value. For FPL, a corresponding adjustment would be made to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment, and for NEE’s non-rate regulated operations, a corresponding amount would be recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds – net in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\nCredit Risk\nNEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. NEE manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees.\n54\nCredit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. NEE’s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. For all derivative and contractual transactions, NEE’s energy marketing and trading operations, which include FPL's energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Some relevant considerations when assessing NEE’s energy marketing and trading operations’ credit risk exposure include the following:\n•\nOperations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry.\n•\nTrade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the U.S.\n•\nOverall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the EMC.\n•\nProspective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral.\n•\nMaster netting agreements are used to offset cash and noncash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. NEE’s policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties.\nBased on NEE’s policies and risk exposures related to credit, NEE and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. At December 31, 2023, NEE's credit risk exposure associated with its energy marketing and trading counterparties, taking into account collateral and contractual netting rights, totaled approximately\n$3.5 billion\n($83 million for FPL), of which approximately 93% (100% for FPL) was with companies that have investment grade credit ratings.

    "text": "MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nNextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NEE) and Florida Power & Light Company's (FPL) management are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The consolidated financial statements, which in part are based on informed judgments and estimates made by management, have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.\nTo aid in carrying out this responsibility, we, along with all other members of management, maintain a system of internal accounting control which is established after weighing the cost of such controls against the benefits derived. In the opinion of management, the overall system of internal accounting control provides reasonable assurance that the assets of NEE and FPL and their subsidiaries are safeguarded and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and are properly recorded for the preparation of financial statements. In addition, management believes the overall system of internal accounting control provides reasonable assurance that material errors or irregularities would be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their duties. Any system of internal accounting control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that controls can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting.\nThe system of internal accounting control is supported by written policies and guidelines, the selection and training of qualified employees, an organizational structure that provides an appropriate division of responsibility and a program of internal auditing. NEE's written policies include a Code of Business Conduct & Ethics that states management's policy on conflicts of interest and ethical conduct. Compliance with the Code of Business Conduct & Ethics is confirmed annually by key personnel.\nThe Board of Directors pursues its oversight responsibility for financial reporting and accounting through its Audit Committee. This Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, meets regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors to make inquiries as to the manner in which the responsibilities of each are being discharged. The independent auditors and the internal audit staff have free access to the Committee without management present to discuss auditing, internal accounting control and financial reporting matters.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n. Based on this assessment, management believes that NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nNEE's and FPL's independent registered public accounting firm,\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n, is engaged to express an opinion on NEE's and FPL's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting. Their reports are based on procedures believed by them to provide a reasonable basis to support such opinions. These reports appear on the following pages.\n56\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nNextEra Energy, Inc. and Florida Power & Light Company\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NextEra Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (NEE) and Florida Power & Light Company and subsidiaries (FPL) as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, NEE and FPL maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 of NEE and FPL and our report dated February 16, 2024, expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nNEE's and FPL’s management are responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for their assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on NEE’s and FPL’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to NEE and FPL in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nBoca Raton, Florida\nFebruary 16, 2024\n57\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nNextEra Energy, Inc. and Florida Power & Light Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NextEra Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (NEE) and the related separate consolidated balance sheets of Florida Power & Light Company and subsidiaries (FPL) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and NEE's and FPL's related consolidated statements of income and cash flows, NEE's consolidated statements of comprehensive income and equity, and FPL’s consolidated statements of common shareholder’s equity, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of NEE and the consolidated financial position of FPL as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), NEE’s and FPL’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2024, expressed unqualified opinions on NEE’s and FPL’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of NEE’s and FPL’s management. Our responsibility is to express opinions on NEE’s and FPL’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to NEE and FPL in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements of NEE and FPL that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nNEE – Operating Revenue – Unrealized Gains – Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nNEE enters into complex energy derivatives and transacts in certain markets that are thinly traded, which may result in subjective estimates of fair value that include unobservable inputs. Changes in the derivatives’ fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are primarily recognized on a net basis in operating revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gains associated with Level 3 transactions of $\n1,482\nmillion are included in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of income of NEE.\nGiven management uses complex proprietary models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities, performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our firm specialists who possess significant quantitative and modeling expertise.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to operating revenue – unrealized gains included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls relating to commodity valuation models, their related Level 3 unobservable inputs, and market data validation.\n58\n•\nWe selected a sample of transactions, obtained an understanding of the business rationale of transactions, and read the underlying contractual agreements.\n•\nWe used personnel in our firm who specialize in energy transacting to independently value Level 3 transactions. For certain fair value models, we used our firm specialists to directly test the underlying assumptions of the unobservable inputs used by management.\n•\nWe evaluated NEE’s disclosures related to the proprietary models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities, including the balances recorded and significant assumptions.\nFPL\n–\nImpact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nFPL is subject to rate regulation by the Florida Public Service Commission (the “FPSC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric utility companies. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; fuel expense; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.\nRates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of FPL’s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, FPL’s investment in the assets required to deliver utility service. Accounting guidance for FPL’s regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Future FPSC decisions could impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of recoverable costs and any refunds that may be required. As a result of this cost-based regulation, FPL follows the accounting guidance that allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities, based on the probability of future cash flows, that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the requirement to have auditors with deep knowledge of and significant experience with accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the impact of rate regulation included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment and regulatory assets or liabilities; the depreciation and amortization of such amounts in accordance with FPSC orders; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs recognized as property, plant and equipment and regulatory assets in future rates or of a refund or future reduction in rates that should be recognized as a regulatory liability.\n•\nWe assessed the likelihood of (1) recovery of recorded regulatory assets and (2) obligations requiring future reductions in rates by obtaining, reading, and evaluating relevant regulatory orders issued by the FPSC to FPL, and considering regulatory precedents established by the FPSC. We also evaluated such regulatory orders and other publicly available filings made by FPL and compared them to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nWe evaluated FPL's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nBoca Raton, Florida\nFebruary 16, 2024\nWe have served as NEE’s and FPL’s auditor since 1950.\n59\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(millions, except per share amounts)\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n60\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(millions)\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n61\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(millions, except par value)\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n62\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(millions)\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n63\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY\n(millions)\n_________________________\n(a)\nDividends per share were $\n1.87\n, $\n1.70\nand $\n1.54\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n.\n(b)\nSee Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests.\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n64\nFLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(millions)\n______________________\n(a)\nFPL's comprehensive income is the same as reported net income.\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n65\nFLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(millions, except share amount)\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n66\nFLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(millions)\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n67\nFLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMMON SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY\n(millions)\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n68\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYears Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\n– The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities in the former service areas of FPL and Gulf Power. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one electric ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs (see Rate Regulation – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below).\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to approximately\n5.9\nmillion customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and\neight\ncounties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through both controlled and consolidated entities and noncontrolling owner\nship interests in joint ventures. NEER participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either wholly owned subsidiaries or noncontrolling or joint venture interests. NEER also invests in rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities.\nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts included in prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of c\nontingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nOperating Revenues\n–\nFPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE’s operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2\n, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income and were approximately $\n1,139\nmillion, $\n1,035\nmillion and $\n852\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue. See Energy Trading below and Note 3.\nRate Regulation\n– FPL, the most significant of NEE's rate-regulated subsidiaries, is subject to rate regulation by the FPSC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Its rates are designed to recover the cost of providing service to its customers including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. As a result of this cost-based regulation, FPL follows the accounting guidance that allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process.\n69\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNEE's and FPL's regulatory assets and liabilities are as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nThe majority of these regulatory assets are being amortized over\n20\nyears.\n(b)\nThe majority of these regulatory assets are being amortized over a\n21\n-month period that began April 2023.\n(c)\nThe majority of these regulatory assets are being amortized over a\n12\n-month period that began April 2023. See Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below.\n(d)\nSee Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization below.\nCost recovery clauses, which are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through various clauses, include substantially all fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, costs associated with an FPSC-approved transmission and distribution storm protection plan, certain costs associated with the acquisition and retirement of several electric generation facilities, certain construction-related costs for certain of FPL's solar generation facilities, and conservation and certain environmental-related costs.\nRevenues from cost recovery clauses are recorded when billed; FPL achieves matching of costs and related revenues by deferring the net under-recovery or over-recovery. Any under-recovered costs or over-recovered revenues are collected from or returned to customers in subsequent periods.\nIf FPL were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. The continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period. Regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed within various subsections below.\nBase Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 – In December 2021, the FPSC issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2021 rate agreement).\nKey elements of the 2021 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2022 through at least December 2025, include, among other things, the following:\n•\nNew retail base rates and charges were established for the combined utility system (including the former Gulf Power Company service area) resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues:\n◦\n$\n692\nmillion beginning January 1, 2022, and\n70\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n◦\n$\n560\nmillion beginning January 1, 2023.\n•\nIn addition, FPL is eligible to receive, subject to conditions specified in the 2021 rate agreement, base rate increases associated with the addition of up to\n894\nmegawatts (MW) annually of new solar generation (through a Solar Base Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) mechanism) in each of 2024 and 2025, and may carry forward any unused MW in 2024 to 2025. FPL has agreed to an installed cost cap of $\n1,250\nper kilowatt and will be required to demonstrate that these proposed solar facilities are cost effective.\n•\nFPL's authorized regulatory return on common equity (ROE) was\n10.60\n%, with a range of\n9.70\n% to\n11.70\n%. However, in the event the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate was\n2.49\n% or greater over a consecutive\nsix-month\nperiod, FPL was authorized to increase the regulatory ROE to\n10.80\n% with a range of\n9.80\n% to\n11.80\n%. During August 2022, this provision was triggered and effective September 1, 2022, FPL's authorized regulatory ROE and ROE range were increased. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below\n9.80\n%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above\n11.80\n%, any party with standing may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates.\n•\nSubject to certain conditions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2021 rate agreement, up to $\n1.45\nbillion of depreciation reserve surplus, provided that in any year of the 2021 rate agreement FPL must amortize at least enough reserve amount to maintain its minimum authorized regulatory ROE and also may not amortize any reserve amount that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of its maximum authorized regulatory ROE.\n•\nFPL is authorized to expand SolarTogether\n®\n, a voluntary community solar program that gives FPL electric customers an opportunity to participate directly in the expansion of solar energy where participants pay a fixed monthly subscription charge and receive credits on their related monthly customer bill, by constructing an additional\n1,788\nMW of solar generation from 2022 through 2025, such that the total capacity of SolarTogether\n®\nwould be\n3,278\nMW.\n•\nFuture storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning\n60\ndays from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $\n4\nfor every\n1,000\nkilowatt-hour (kWh) of usage on residential bills during the first\n12\nmonths of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $\n800\nmillion in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $\n4\nsurcharge. See Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below.\n•\nIf federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the 2021 rate agreement, FPL will prospectively adjust base rates after a review by the FPSC. As a result of the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (see Note 5), FPL's customers are expected to save approximately $\n400\nmillion over the remaining term of the 2021 rate agreement which includes a $\n36\nmillion one-time refund made in January 2023.\nOn September 28, 2023, the Florida Supreme Court ruled on the appeal of the FPSC’s final order regarding FPL’s 2021 rate agreement by Floridians Against Increased Rates, Inc. and, as a group, Florida Rising, Inc., Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Inc. and League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida. The ruling remands the FPSC's order back to the FPSC. While management is unable to predict with certainty the eventual outcome, FPL believes the FPSC's subsequent order will maintain its determination that the 2021 rate agreement is in the public interest and should remain intact.\nBase Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021 – From January 2017 to December 2021, FPL operated under a base rate agreement (2016 rate agreement) that provided for, among other things, a regulatory ROE of\n10.55\n%, with a range of\n9.60\n% to\n11.60\n% and, subject to certain conditions, the right to reduce depreciation expense up to $\n1.25\nbillion (reserve), provided that in any year of the 2016 rate agreement FPL was required to amortize enough reserve to maintain an earned regulatory ROE within the range of\n9.60\n% to\n11.60\n%.\nElectric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization\n– The cost of additions to units of property of FPL and NEER is added to electric plant in service and other property. In accordance with regulatory accounting, the cost of FPL's and NEER's rate-regulated transmission businesses' units of utility property retired, less estimated net salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs of property as well as replacements and renewals of items determined to be less than units of utility property are charged to other operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, as amended, provided for an option to elect a cash grant (convertible investment tax credits (ITCs)) for certain renewable energy property (renewable property). Convertible ITCs are recorded as a reduction in property, plant and equipment on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated life of the related property. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, convertible ITCs, net of amortization, were approximately $\n633\nmillion ($\n106\nmillion at FPL) and $\n693\nmillion ($\n111\nmillion at FPL).\nDepreciation of FPL's electric property is provided on a straight-line basis, primarily over its average remaining useful life. FPL includes in depreciation expense a provision for electric generation plant dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, accretion related to asset retirement obligations (see Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below) and storm recovery amortization. For substantially all of FPL's property, depreciation studies are performed periodically and filed with the FPSC which result in updated depreciation rates. As part of the 2021 rate agreement, the FPSC approved new unified depreciation rates which became effective January 1, 2022. Reserve amortization is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. FPL files a twelve-month forecast with the FPSC each year which contains a regulatory ROE intended to be earned based on the best information FPL has at that time assuming normal weather. This forecast establishes a targeted regulatory ROE. In order to earn the targeted regulatory ROE in each reporting period subject to the conditions of the effective rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital\n71\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nstructure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items is adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization or its reversal to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. See Rate Regulation – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 above.\nNEER's electric plant in service and other property less salvage value, if any, are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. NEER reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. NEER's oil and gas production assets are accounted for under the successful efforts method. Depletion expenses for the acquisition of reserve rights and development costs are recognized using the unit of production method. Depreciation of NEER’s rate-regulated transmission assets are provided on a straight-line basis, primarily over their average remaining useful life. NEER includes in depreciation expense a provision for dismantlement, interim asset removal costs and accretion related to asset retirement obligations. For substantially all of NEER’s rate-regulated transmission assets, depreciation studies are performed periodically and filed with FERC which result in updated depreciation rates.\nNuclear Fuel\n– FPL and NEER have several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel. See Note 15 – Contracts. FPL's and NEER's nuclear fuel costs are charged to fuel expense on a unit of production method.\nConstruction Activity\n– Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is a noncash item which represents the allowed cost of capital, including an ROE, used to finance construction projects. FPL records the portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds as a reduction of interest expense and the remainder as other income. FPSC rules limit the recording of AFUDC to projects that have an estimated cost in excess of\n0.4\n% of a utility's plant in service balance and require more than one year to complete. FPSC rules allow construction projects below the applicable threshold as a component of rate base.\nFPL's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, engineering costs, AFUDC and other costs directly associated with the construction of various projects. Upon completion of the projects, these costs are transferred to electric utility plant in service and other property. Capitalized costs associated with construction activities are charged to O&M expenses when recoverability is no longer probable.\nNEER capitalizes project development costs once it is probable that such costs will be realized through the ultimate construction of the related asset or sale of development rights. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, NEER's capitalized development costs totaled approximately $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion, respectively, which are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. These costs include land rights and other third-party costs directly associated with the development of a new project. Upon commencement of construction, these costs either are transferred to construction work in progress or remain in other assets, depending upon the nature of the cost. Capitalized development costs are charged to O&M expenses when it is probable that these costs will not be realized.\nNEER's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, third-party engineering costs, capitalized interest and other costs directly associated with the construction and development of various projects. Interest expense allocated from NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH) to NEER is based on a deemed capital structure of\n70\n% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries. Upon commencement of project operation, costs associated with construction work in progress are transferred to electric plant in service and other property.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n– NEE and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. NEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. See Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below and Note 11.\nFor NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the asset retirement cost is allocated to a regulatory liability or regulatory asset using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the ARO and a decrease in the regulatory liability or regulatory asset. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO and asset retirement cost, or regulatory liability when asset retirement cost is depleted.\nFor NEE's non-rate regulated operations, the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the asset retirement cost, or income when asset retirement cost is depleted.\n72\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nDecommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs\n– For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues for the cost of end of life retirement and disposal of its nuclear and other generation plants over the expected service life of each unit based on nuclear decommissioning and other generation dismantlement studies periodically filed with the FPSC. In addition, FPL accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. As approved by the FPSC, FPL previously suspended its annual decommissioning accrual. Any differences between expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount recovered through rates are reported as a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with regulatory accounting. See Rate Regulation, Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, and Asset Retirement Obligations above and Note 11.\nNuclear decommissioning studies are performed at least every\nfive years\nand are filed with the FPSC for approval. FPL filed updated nuclear decommissioning studies with the FPSC in December 2020. These studies reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL's nuclear units at the time of the studies. The 2020 studies provide for the dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 following the end of plant operation with decommissioning activities commencing in 2052 and 2053, respectively, however, in 2022, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) amended Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 license renewals by removing the 20 additional years of operation reflected in the studies. FPL filed a site-specific environmental impact statement with the NRC related to the previously approved 20-year renewal application for both Turkey Point operating licenses. Approval of the additional 20 years of operations is pending. The studies filed in 2020 also provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2043. These studies also assume that FPL will be storing spent fuel on site pending removal to a United States (U.S.) government facility. FPL's portion of the ultimate costs of decommissioning its\nfour\nnuclear units, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $\n9.4\nbillion, or $\n2.5\nbillion expressed in 2023 dollars. The ultimate costs of decommissioning reflect the applications submitted to the NRC for the extension of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 and St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 licenses for an additional\n20\nyears.\nRestricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPL's nuclear units are included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities held in the decommissioning funds are primarily carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses and estimated credit losses on debt securities, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding offset in the related regulatory asset or liability accounts. FPL does not currently make contributions to the decommissioning funds, other than the reinvestment of fund earnings. During 2023, 2022 and 2021 fund earnings on decommissioning funds were approximately $\n144\nmillion, $\n58\nmillion and $\n173\nmillion, respectively. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\nOther generation plant dismantlement studies are performed periodically and are submitted to the FPSC for approval. Previously approved studies were effective from January 1, 2017 through December 2021 and resulted in an annual expense of $\n26\nmillion which is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. As part of the 2021 rate agreement, the FPSC approved a new annual expense of $\n48\nmillion based on FPL's updated dismantlement studies which became effective January 1, 2022. At December 31, 2023, FPL's portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its other generation units is approximately $\n2.4\nbillion, or $\n1.2\nbillion expressed in 2023 dollars.\nNEER's AROs primarily include nuclear decommissioning liabilities for Seabrook Station (Seabrook), Duane Arnold Energy Center (Duane Arnold) and Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) and dismantlement liabilities for its wind and solar facilities. The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning or dismantlement activities are expected to be complete. See Note 11. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, NEER's ARO was approximately $\n1.3\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion, respectively, and was primarily determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning or dismantlement. NEER's portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $\n9.8\nbillion, or $\n2.2\nbillion expressed in 2023 dollars. The ultimate cost to dismantle NEER's wind and solar facilities is estimated to be approximately $\n3.1\nbillion.\nSeabrook files a comprehensive nuclear decommissioning study with the New Hampshire Nuclear Decommissioning Financing Committee (NDFC) every\nfour years\n; the most recent study was filed in 2023. Seabrook's decommissioning funding plan is also subject to annual review by the NDFC. Currently, there are no ongoing decommissioning funding requirements for Seabrook, Duane Arnold and Point Beach, however, the NRC, and in the case of Seabrook, the NDFC, has the authority to require additional funding in the future. NEER's portion of Seabrook's, Duane Arnold's and Point Beach's restricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission these plants is included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities held in the decommissioning funds are primarily carried at fair value. See Note 4. Market adjustments for debt securities result in a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (OCI), except for estimated credit losses and unrealized losses on debt securities intended or\n73\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nrequired to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are recognized in other – net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Market adjustments for equity securities are recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds – net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses are recognized in income and are reinvested in the funds. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\nMajor Maintenance Costs\n– FPL expenses costs associated with planned maintenance for its non-nuclear electric generation plants as incurred. FPL recognizes costs associated with planned major nuclear maintenance in accordance with regulatory treatment. FPL defers nuclear maintenance costs for each nuclear unit’s planned outage to a regulatory asset as the costs are incurred. FPL amortizes the costs to O&M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\nNEER uses the deferral method to account for certain planned major maintenance costs. NEER's major maintenance costs for its nuclear generation units, combustion turbines and battery storage are capitalized (included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets) and amortized to O&M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\nCash Equivalents\n– Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of generally three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\n– At December 31, 2023 and 2022, NEE had approximately $\n730\nmillion ($\n15\nmillion for FPL) and $\n1,840\nmillion ($\n33\nmillion for FPL), respectively, of restricted cash, which is included in current other assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash is primarily related to debt service payments and margin cash collateral requirements at NEER and bond proceeds held for construction at FPL. In addition, where offsetting positions exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral of $\n194\nmillion is netted against derivative assets and $\n815\nmillion is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2023 and $\n7\nmillion is netted against derivative assets and $\n1,541\nmillion is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2022. See Note 3.\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n– NEE and FPL follow the current expected credit loss (CECL) model to account for credit losses for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Bad Debt\n– FPL maintains an accumulated provision for uncollectible customer accounts receivable that is estimated using a percentage, derived from historical revenue and write-off trends, of the previous four months of revenue, and includes estimates of credit and other losses based on both current events and forecasts. NEER regularly reviews collectibility of its receivables and establishes a provision for losses estimated as a percentage of accounts receivable based on the historical bad debt write-off trends for its retail electricity provider operations, as well as includes estimates for credit and other losses based on both current events and forecasts. When necessary, NEER uses the specific identification method for all other receivables.\nCredit Losses\n–\nNEE's credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates. Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based on established standards and credit quality indicators. Credit quality indicators and standards that are closely monitored include credit ratings, certain financial ratios and delinquency trends which are based off the latest available information. Customers not meeting minimum standards provide various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit, the posting of margin cash collateral or use of master netting arrangements.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, NEE recorded approximately $\n77\nmillion, $\n113\nmillion and $\n146\nmillion of bad debt expense, including credit losses, respectively, which are included in O&M expenses in NEE’s consolidated statements of income. The amounts recorded in 2021 primarily relate to credit losses at NEER driven by the operational and energy market impacts of severe prolonged winter weather in Texas in February 2021 (February 2021 weather event). The estimate for credit losses related to the impacts of the February 2021 weather event was developed based on NEE’s assessment of the ultimate collectability of these receivables.\nInventory\n– FPL values materials, supplies and fuel inventory using a weighted-average cost method. NEER's materials, supplies and fuel inventories, which include emissions allowances and renewable energy credits, are carried at the lower of weighted-average cost and net realizable value, unless evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost will be recovered with a normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of business.\nEnergy Trading\n– NEE provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load-following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to optimize the value of electricity and fuel contracts, generation facilities and gas infrastructure assets, as well as to take advantage of projected favorable commodity price movements. Trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are\n74\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\naccounted for at fair value and realized gains and losses from all trading contracts, including those where physical delivery is required, are recorded net for all periods presented. See Note 3.\nStorm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery\n– The storm funds provide coverage toward FPL's storm damage costs. Marketable securities held in the storm funds are carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding adjustment to the storm reserve. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes. The storm funds are included in special use funds and the storm reserves in noncurrent regulatory liabilities or, in the case of a deficit, in regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring 2023, the FPSC approved FPL's request to begin recovering eligible storm costs of approximately $\n1.3\nbillion, primarily related to surcharges for Hurricanes Ian and Nicole which impacted FPL's service area in 2022. The amount is being collected through an interim surcharge that will apply for a\n12-month\nperiod that began April 2023 and is subject to refund based on an FPSC prudence review. Recoverable storm costs are recorded as current and noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. The unpaid portion of the storm restoration costs at December 31, 2022, of approximately $\n618\nmillion, including estimated capital costs, is included in other current liabilities on NEE’s and FPL’s 2022 consolidated balance sheet.\nContract Assets\n– From time to time, NEER enters into agreements to build and sell renewable generation facilities and other assets to third parties. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, contract assets on NEE’s consolidated balance sheets primarily represent costs for such facilities and assets that are expected to be sold in less than 12 months.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n–\nNEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nThe impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset's fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate.\nImpairment of Equity Method Investments\n– NEE evaluates its equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value and the investment may be other than temporarily impaired (OTTI). An impairment loss is required to be recognized if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Investments that are OTTI are written down to their estimated fair value and cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value. Impairment losses are recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n–\nNEE's goodwill and other intangible assets are as follows:\n75\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNEE's, including FPL's, goodwill relates to various acquisitions which were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Other intangible assets are primarily included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. NEE's other intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of the other intangible assets was approximately $\n58\nmillion, $\n18\nmillion and $\n25\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is expected to be approximately $\n57\nmillion, $\n51\nmillion, $\n49\nmillion, $\n47\nmillion and $\n45\nmillion for 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based analysis. Other intangible assets subject to amortization are periodically reviewed when impairment indicators are present to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted future cash flows.\nPension Plan\n– NEE records the service cost component of net periodic benefit income to O&M expense and the non-service cost component to other net periodic benefit income in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE allocates net periodic pension income to its subsidiaries based on the pensionable earnings of the subsidiaries' employees. Accounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.\nStock-Based Compensation\n– NEE accounts for stock-based payment transactions based on grant-date fair value. Compensation costs for awards with graded vesting are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Forfeitures of stock-based awards are recognized as they occur. See Note 14 – Stock-Based Compensation.\nRetirement of Long-Term Debt\n– For NEE's rate-regulated subsidiaries, including FPL, gains and losses that result from differences in reacquisition cost and the net book value of long-term debt which is retired are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability and amortized to interest expense ratably over the remaining life of the original issue, which is consistent with their treatment in the ratemaking process. NEE's non-rate regulated subsidiaries recognize such differences in interest expense at the time of retirement.\nStructured Payables\n– Under NEE's structured payables program, subsidiaries of NEE issue negotiable drafts, backed by NEECH guarantees, to settle invoices with suppliers with payment terms (on average approximately 90 days) that extend the original invoice due date (typically 30 days) and include a service fee. At their discretion, the suppliers may assign the negotiable drafts and the rights under the NEECH guarantees to financial institutions. NEE and its subsidiaries are not party to any contractual agreements between their suppliers and the applicable financial institutions.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, NEE's outstanding obligations under its structured payables program were approximately\n$\n4.7\nbillion\nand $\n3.7\nbillion, respectively, substantially all of which is included in\naccounts payable\non NEE's consolidated balance sheets.\nIncome Taxes\n– Deferred income taxes are recognized on all significant temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are presented as noncurrent on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the tax sharing agreement between NEE and certain of its subsidiaries, the income tax provision at each applicable subsidiary reflects the use of the \"separate return method,\" except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis, but are used on the consolidated tax return, are recorded by the applicable subsidiary that generated the tax benefits. Any remaining consolidated income tax benefits or expenses are recorded at the corporate level. Included in other regulatory assets and other regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets is the revenue equivalent of the difference in deferred income taxes computed under accounting rules, as compared to regulatory accounting rules. The net regulatory liability totaled $\n3,195\nmillion ($\n3,145\nmillion for FPL) and $\n3,504\nmillion ($\n3,449\nmillion for FPL) at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is being amortized in accordance with the regulatory treatment over the estimated lives of the assets or liabilities for which the deferred tax amount was initially recognized.\nProduction tax credits (PTCs) are recognized as wind and solar energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes and are recorded as a reduction of current income taxes payable, unless limited by tax law in which instance they are recorded as deferred tax assets. NEER recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense when the related energy property is placed into service. FPL recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense over the depreciable life of the related energy property. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, FPL’s accumulated deferred ITCs were approximately $\n997\nmillion and $\n1,031\nmillion, respectively, and are included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. For taxable years beginning after 2022, renewable energy tax credits generated during the taxable year can be transferred to an unrelated purchaser for cash and are accounted for under\nAccounting Standards Codification 740 - Income Taxes\n. Proceeds resulting from the sales of renewable energy tax credits, approximately $\n370\nmillion\n76\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nin 2023, are reported in the cash paid (received) for income taxes – net within the supplemental disclosures of cash flow information on NEE’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. NEE recognizes interest income (expense) related to unrecognized tax benefits (liabilities) in interest income and interest expense, respectively, net of the amount deferred at FPL. At FPL, the offset to accrued interest receivable (payable) on income taxes is classified as a regulatory liability (regulatory asset) which will be amortized to income (expense) over a\nfive-year\nperiod upon settlement in accordance with regulatory treatment. All tax positions taken by NEE in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not threshold. NEE and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states, the most significant of which is Florida, and certain foreign jurisdictions. Federal tax liabilities, with the exception of certain refund claims, are effectively settled for all years prior to 2019. State and foreign tax liabilities, which have varied statutes of limitations regarding additional assessments, are generally effectively settled for years prior to 2019. At December 31, 2023, NEE had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $\n96\nmillion that, if recognized, could impact the annual effective income tax rate. The amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest accruals may change within the next 12 months; however, NEE and FPL do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on NEE’s or FPL’s financial statements. See Note 5.\nNoncontrolling Interests\n–\nNoncontrolling interests represent the portion of net assets in consolidated entities that are not owned by NEE and are reported as a component of equity on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2023, noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets primarily reflects the interests related to differential membership interests discussed below, as well as other noncontrolling interests in certain wind and solar generation and transmission facilities sold to non-affiliated parties and NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NEP).\nCertain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have sold Class B noncontrolling membership interests in entities that have ownership interests in wind generation, solar generation and battery storage facilities, with generating/storage capacity in operation or under construction totaling approximately\n13,527\nMW,\n4,049\nMW and\n1,077\nMW, respectively, at December 31, 2023\n, to third-party investors (differential membership interests). The third-party investors are allocated earnings, tax attributes and cash flows in accordance with the respective limited liability company agreements. Those economics are allocated primarily to the third-party investors until they receive a targeted return (the flip date) and thereafter to NEE. NEE has the right to call the third-party interests at specified amounts if and when the flip date occurs. NEE has determined the allocation of economics between the controlling party and third-party investor should not follow the respective ownership percentages for each wind generation, solar generation and battery storage project but rather the hypothetical liquidation of book value (HLBV) method based on the governing provisions in each respective limited liability company agreement. Under the HLBV method, the amounts of income and loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest reflects changes in the amount the owners would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the respective liquidation provisions, assuming the net assets of these entities were liquidated at the recorded amounts, after taking into account any capital transactions, such as contributions and distributions, between the entities and the owners. At the point in time that the third-party investor, in hypothetical liquidation, would achieve its targeted return, NEE attributes the additional hypothetical proceeds to the differential membership interests based on the call price. A loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on NEE’s consolidated statements of income represents earnings attributable to NEE.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately $\n8,857\nmillion and $\n7,610\nmillion, respectively, of noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets relates to differential membership interests. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, NEE recorded earnings of approximately $\n1,135\nmillion, $\n987\nmillion and $\n825\nmillion, respectively, associated with differential membership interests, which is reflected as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated statements of income.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n– Certain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold Class B noncontrolling membership interests in entities that have ownership interests in wind generation, as well as solar and solar plus battery storage facilities to third-party investors. As specified in the respective limited liability company agreements, if, subject to certain contingencies, certain events occur, including, among others, those that would delay completion or cancel any of the underlying projects, an investor has the option to require NEER to return all or part of its investment. As these potential redemptions were outside of NEER’s control, these balances were classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. During 2023, the contingencies associated with the December 31, 2022 balance were resolved and reclassified to noncontrolling interests. The contingencies associated with the December 31, 2023 balance are expected to be resolved in 2024.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs)\n– An entity is considered to be a VIE when its total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or its equity investors, as a group, lack the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest. A reporting company is required to consolidate a VIE as its primary beneficiary when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant\n77\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nto the VIE. NEE and FPL evaluate whether an entity is a VIE whenever reconsideration events as defined by the accounting guidance occur. See Note 9.\nLeases\n– NEE and FPL determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. NEE and FPL recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability for operating and finance leases by recognizing and measuring leases at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For sales-type leases, the book value of the leased asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type lease is recognized based on fixed payments under the contract and the residual value of the asset being leased. NEE and FPL have elected not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases and not to separate nonlease components from associated lease components for all classes of underlying assets except for purchased power agreements. ROU assets are includ\ned in\nnoncurrent other assets, lease liabilities are included in current and noncurrent other liabilities and net investments in sales-type leases are included in current and noncurrent other assets on NEE’s and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease expense is included in O&M or fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses, interest and amortization expenses associated with finance leases are included in interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense, respectively, and rental income associated with operating leases and interest income associated with sales-type leases are included in operating revenues in NEE’s and FPL’s consolidated statements of income. See Note 10.\nDisposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests\n– In November 2023, FPL sold its ownership interests in its Florida City Gas business for cash proceeds of approximately $\n924\nmillion. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $\n406\nmillion ($\n306\nmillion after tax at NEE and $\n300\nmillion after tax at FPL) was recorded in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023 and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net.\nIn June 2023, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold to a NEP subsidiary their\n100\n% ownership interests in\nfive\nwind generation facilities and\nthree\nsolar generation facilities located in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. with a total generating capacity of\n688\nMW for cash proceeds of approximately $\n566\nmillion, plus working capital of $\n32\nmillion. A NextEra Energy Resources affiliate will continue to operate the facilities included in the sale.\nIn December 2022, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold (i) a\n49\n% controlling ownership interest in\nthree\nwind generation facilities and\none\nsolar plus battery facility located in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. with a total generating capacity of\n1,437\nMW and\n65\nMW of battery storage capacity, two of which facilities were under construction, and (ii) their\n100\n% ownership interest in\nthree\nwind generation facilities located in the Midwest region of the U.S. with a total generating capacity of\n347\nMW to a NEP subsidiary for cash proceeds of approximately $\n805\nmillion, plus working capital and other adjustments of $\n8\nmillion. NEER continued to consolidate one of the projects under construction for accounting purposes through March 2023 and the second project under construction through July 2023. A NextEra Energy Resources affiliate will continue to operate the facilities included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $\n301\nmillion ($\n230\nmillion after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022 and is included in the gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net. In connection with the two facilities that were under construction, approximately $\n251\nmillion of cash received was recorded as contract liabilities, which is included in current other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022. The contract liabilities related to sale proceeds from NEP of approximately $\n150\nmillion and differential membership interests of approximately $\n101\nmillion. In 2023, the two facilities achieved commercial operations and approximately $\n251\nmillion of contract liabilities were reversed and the sale of those facilities was recognized for accounting purposes. In addition, NextEra Energy Resources was responsible to pay for all construction costs related to the portfolio. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately $\n68\nmillion and $\n810\nmillion, respectively, are included in accounts payable on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and represent amounts owed by NextEra Energy Resources to NEP to reimburse NEP for construction costs.\nIn 2022, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold to a NEP subsidiary a\n67\n% controlling ownership interest in a battery storage facility in California with storage capacity of\n230\nMW, for cash proceeds of approximately $\n191\nmillion, plus working capital and other adjustments of $\n2\nmillion. A NextEra Energy Resources affiliate will continue to operate the facility included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $\n87\nmillion ($\n66\nmillion after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022 and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net.\n78\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIn 2021, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold their\n100\n% ownership interest, comprised of a\n50\n% controlling ownership interest to a NEP subsidiary and a\n50\n% noncontrolling ownership interest to a third party, in a portfolio of\nseven\nwind generation facilities and\nsix\nsolar generation facilities in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. representing a total generating capacity of\n2,520\nMW and\n115\nMW of battery storage capacity, three of which facilities were under construction. Total cash proceeds for these two separate transactions totaled approximately $\n1.7\nbillion. NEER continued to consolidate the three projects under construction for accounting purposes through the first quarter of 2022. A NextEra Energy Resources affiliate will continue to operate the facilities included in the sales. In connection with the sales, a loss of approximately $\n53\nmillion ($\n33\nmillion after tax) was recorded in NEE’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021 and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net. In connection with the three facilities that were under construction, approximately $\n668\nmillion of cash received was recorded as contract liabilities on NEE’s consolidated balance. The contract liabilities related to sale proceeds from NEP and the third party of approximately $\n349\nmillion and differential membership interests of approximately $\n319\nmillion, of which $\n117\nmillion was contingent on the enactment of a solar PTC by a specified date in 2022. In 2022, the three facilities achieved commercial operations and approximately $\n551\nmillion of contract liabilities were reversed and the sale of those facilities was recognized for accounting purposes. In addition, the IRA was enacted establishing a solar PTC which resolved the outstanding contingencies and $\n117\nmillion of contract liabilities were reversed and a gain was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022 which is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net.\nIn 2021, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold to a NEP subsidiary their\n100\n% ownership interests in\nthree\nwind generation facilities and\none\nsolar generation facility located in the West and Midwest regions of the U.S. with a total generating capacity of\n467\nMW and\n33.3\n% of the noncontrolling ownership interests in\nfour\nsolar generation facilities and multiple distributed generation solar facilities located in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. representing a total net ownership interest in plant capacity (net generating capacity) of\n122\nMW for cash proceeds of approximately $\n563\nmillion, plus working capital and other adjustments of $\n22\nmillion. A NextEra Energy Resources affiliate will continue to operate the facilities included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $\n94\nmillion ($\n69\nmillion after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net, and noncontrolling interests of approximately $\n125\nmillion and additional paid-in capital of approximately $\n60\nmillion ($\n43\nmillion after tax) were recorded on NEE's consolidated balance sheet.\n2.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The promised goods or services in the majority of NEE’s contracts with customers is, at FPL, for the delivery of electricity based on tariff rates approved by the FPSC and, at NEER, for the delivery of energy commodities and the availability of electric capacity and electric transmission.\nFPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE’s operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers, as well as derivative (see Note 3) and lease transactions at NEER. For the vast majority of contracts with customers, NEE believes that the obligation to deliver energy, capacity or transmission is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as NEE performs. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, NEE’s revenue from contracts with customers was approximately $\n24.8\nbillion ($\n18.2\nbillion at FPL), $\n23.0\nbillion ($\n17.2\nbillion at FPL) and $\n18.8\nbillion ($\n14.1\nbillion at FPL), respectively. NEE's and FPL's receivables are primarily associated with revenues earned from contracts with customers, as well as derivative and lease transactions at NEER, and consist of both billed and unbilled amounts, which are recorded in customer receivables and other receivables on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Receivables represent unconditional rights to consideration and reflect the differences in timing of revenue recognition and cash collections. For substantially all of NEE's and FPL's receivables, regardless of the type of revenue transaction from which the receivable originated, customer and counterparty credit risk is managed in the same manner and the terms and conditions of payment are similar. During 2021, NEER did not recognize approximately $\n180\nmillion of revenue related to reimbursable expenses from a counterparty that were deemed not probable of collection. These reimbursable expenses arose from the impacts of the February 2021 weather event. These determinations were made based on assessments of the counterparty's creditworthiness and NEER's ability to collect.\nFPL\n– FPL’s revenues are derived primarily from tariff-based sales that result from providing electricity to retail customers in Florida with no defined contractual term. Electricity sales to retail customers account for approximately\n90\n% of FPL’s 2023 operating revenues, the majority of which are to residential customers. FPL’s retail customers receive a bill monthly based on the amount of monthly kWh usage with payment due monthly. For these types of sales, FPL recognizes revenue as electricity is delivered and billed to customers, as well as an estimate for electricity delivered and not yet billed. The billed and unbilled amounts represent the value of electricity delivered to the customer. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, FPL's unbilled revenues amounted to approximately $\n633\nmillion and $\n661\nmillion, respectively, and are included in customer receivables on NEE’s and FPL’s consolidated balance sheets. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates through 2041. As of December 31, 2023, FPL expects to record approximately\n$\n380\nmillion\nof revenues related to the fixed capacity price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related\n79\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ncontracts as the capacity is provided. These contracts also contain a variable price component for energy usage which FPL recognizes as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.\nNEER\n– NEER’s revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer. Revenues yet to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging from\n2024 to 2053,\nwill vary based on the volume of energy or transmission delivered and/or available. NEER’s customers typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales through\n2036, certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates through\n2034\nand capacity sales associated with natural gas transportation through 2062. At December 31, 2023, NEER expects to record approximately $\n1.2\nbillion of revenues related to the fixed price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided. The power purchase agreements also contain a variable price component for energy usage which NEER recognizes as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.\n3.\nDerivative Instruments\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. NEE and FPL do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.\nWith respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative instruments executed within prescribed limits to manage the risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices. Transactions in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the over-the-counter markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity markets associated with NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. With regard to full energy and capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce the effect of unfavorable changes in the forward energy markets. Additionally, NEER takes positions in energy markets based on differences between actual forward market levels and management's view of fundamental market conditions, including supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical delivery has been deemed not to have occurred for financial reporting purposes. Settlements related to derivative instruments are substantially all recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\nAt December 31, 2023, NEE's AOCI included immaterial amounts related to discontinued interest rate cash flow hedges with expiration dates through March 2035 and foreign currency cash flow hedges with expiration dates through September 2030.\n80\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nFair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments\n– The fair value of assets and liabilities are determined using either unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) or other pricing inputs that are observable (Level 2) whenever that information is available and using unobservable inputs (Level 3) to estimate fair value only when relevant observable inputs are not available. NEE and FPL use different valuation techniques to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities, relying primarily on the market approach of using prices and other market information for identical and/or similar assets and liabilities for those assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. NEE's and FPL's assessment of the significance of any particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. Non-performance risk, including the consideration of a credit valuation adjustment, is also considered in the determination of fair value for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\nNEE and FPL measure the fair value of commodity contracts using a combination of market and income approaches utilizing prices observed on commodities exchanges and in the non-exchange traded markets, or through the use of industry-standard valuation techniques, such as option modeling or discounted cash flows techniques, incorporating both observable and unobservable valuation inputs. The resulting measurements are the best estimate of fair value as represented by the transfer of the asset or liability through an orderly transaction in the marketplace at the measurement date.\nExchange-traded derivative assets and liabilities are valued using observable settlement prices from the exchanges and are classified as Level 1 or Level 2, depending on whether positions are in active or inactive markets.\nNEE, through its subsidiaries, including FPL, also enters into non-exchange traded commodity derivatives. The majority of the valuation inputs are observable using exchange-quoted prices.\nNEE, through NEER, also enters into full requirements contracts, which, in most cases, meet the definition of derivatives and are measured at fair value. These contracts typically have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation of the contract. In addition, certain non-exchange traded derivative options at NEE have one or more significant inputs that are not observable, and are valued using industry-standard option models.\nIn all cases where NEE and FPL use significant unobservable inputs for the valuation of a commodity contract, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The primary input to the valuation models for commodity contracts is the forward commodity curve for the respective instruments. Other inputs include, but are not limited to, assumptions about market liquidity, volatility, correlation and contract duration as more fully described below in Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements. In instances where the reference markets are deemed to be inactive or do not have transactions for a similar contract, the derivative assets and liabilities may be valued using significant other observable inputs and potentially significant unobservable inputs. In such instances, the valuation for these contracts is established using techniques including extrapolation from or interpolation between actively traded contracts, or estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points. NEE and FPL regularly evaluate and validate the inputs used to determine fair value by a number of methods, consisting of various market price verification procedures, including the use of pricing services and broker quotes to support the market price of the various commodities. Where there are assumptions and models used to generate inputs for valuing derivative assets and liabilities, the review and verification of the assumptions and models are undertaken by individuals in an independent control function.\nNEE uses interest rate contracts and foreign currency contracts to mitigate and adjust interest rate and foreign currency exchange exposure related primarily to certain outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings when deemed appropriate based on market conditions or when required by financing agreements. NEE estimates the fair value of these derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing the net amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the agreements\n.\nThe tables below present NEE's and FPL's gross derivative positions at December 31, 2023 and 2022, as required by disclosure rules. However, the majority of the underlying contracts are subject to master netting agreements and generally would not be contractually settled on a gross basis.\nTherefore, the tables below also present the derivative positions on a net basis, which reflect the offsetting of positions of certain transactions within the portfolio, the contractual ability to settle contracts under master netting arrangements and the netting of margin cash collateral, as well as the location of the net derivative position on the consolidated balance sheets.\n81\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n______________________\n(a)\nIncludes the effect of the contractual ability to settle contracts under master netting arrangements and the netting of margin cash collateral payments and receipts.

These amounts are included in current other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, NEE had approximately $\n73\nmillion (\nnone\nat FPL) and $\n268\nmillion (\nnone\nat FPL), respectively, in margin cash collateral paid to counterparties that was not offset against derivative assets or liabilities in the above presentation. These amounts are included in current other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets.\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements\n– The valuation of certain commodity contracts requires the use of significant unobservable inputs. All forward price, implied volatility, implied correlation and interest rate inputs used in the valuation of such contracts are directly based on third-party market data, such as broker quotes and exchange settlements, when that data is available. If third-party market data is not available, then industry standard methodologies are used to develop inputs that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs, including some forward prices, implied volatilities and interest rates used for determining fair value are updated daily to reflect the best available market information. Unobservable inputs which are related to observable inputs, such as illiquid portions of forward price or volatility curves, are updated daily as well, using industry standard techniques such as interpolation and extrapolation, combining observable forward inputs supplemented by historical market and other relevant data.\n83\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOther unobservable inputs, such as implied correlations, block-to-hourly price shaping, customer migration rates from full requirements contracts and some implied volatility curves, are modeled using proprietary models based on historical data and industry standard techniques.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of NEE's commodity contracts categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2023 are as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nUnobservable inputs were weighted by volume.\n(b)\nMegawatt-hours\n(c)\nOne million British thermal units\n(d)\nApplies only to full requirements contracts.\nThe sensitivity of NEE's fair value measurements to increases (decreases) in the significant unobservable inputs is as follows:\n————————————\n(a)\nAssumes the contract is in a gain position.\n84\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe reconciliation of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are based on significant unobservable inputs is as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nTransfers into Level 3 were a result of decreased observability of market data. Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 were a result of increased observability of market data.\nIncome Statement Impact of Derivative Instruments\n–\nGains (losses) related to NEE's derivatives are recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, FPL recorded gains of approximately $\n5\nmillion, $\n211\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion, respectively, related to commodity contracts as regulatory liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets.\nNotional Volumes of Derivative Instruments\n– The following table represents net notional volumes associated with derivative instruments that are required to be reported at fair value in NEE's and FPL's consolidated financial statements. The table includes significant volumes of transactions that have minimal exposure to commodity price changes because they are variably priced agreements. These volumes are only an indication of the commodity exposure that is managed through the use of derivatives. They do not represent net physical asset positions or non-derivative positions and the related hedges, nor do they represent NEE's and FPL's net economic exposure, but only the net notional derivative positions that fully or partially hedge the related asset positions.\nNEE and FPL had derivative commodity contracts for the following net notional volumes:\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, NEE had interest rate contracts with a net notional amount of approximately $\n25.6\nbillion and $\n19.7\nbillion, respectively, and foreign currency contracts with a notional amount of approximately $\n0.5\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion,\n85\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nrespectively. In January 2024, NEECH reduced the net notional amount of its interest rate contracts by $\n4.0\nbillion as a result of the issuance of fixed-rate debentures at NEECH (see Note 13).\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\n– Certain derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features including, among other things, the requirement to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified credit rating agencies and certain financial ratios, as well as credit-related cross-default and material adverse change triggers. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate fair value of NEE's derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was approximately $\n4.7\nbillion ($\n14\nmillion for FPL) and $\n7.4\nbillion ($\n15\nmillion for FPL), respectively.\nIf the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these derivative agreements were triggered, certain subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, could be required to post collateral or settle contracts according to contractual terms which generally allow netting of contracts in offsetting positions. Certain derivative contracts contain multiple types of credit-related triggers. To the extent these contracts contain a credit ratings downgrade trigger, the maximum exposure is included in the following credit ratings collateral posting requirements. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to BBB/Baa2 (a three level downgrade for FPL and a one level downgrade for NEECH from the current lowest applicable rating), applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately $\n510\nmillion (\nnone\nat FPL) and $\n1,625\nmillion (\nnone\nat FPL) at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post additional collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately $\n2.4\nbillion ($\n15\nmillion at FPL) and $\n5.2\nbillion ($\n20\nmillion at FPL) at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Some derivative contracts do not contain credit ratings downgrade triggers, but do contain provisions that require certain financial measures be maintained and/or have credit-related cross-default triggers. In the event these provisions were triggered, applicable NEE subsidiaries could be required to post additional collateral of up to approximately $\n1.7\nbillion ($\n50\nmillion at FPL) and $\n1.1\nbillion ($\n185\nmillion at FPL) at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCollateral related to derivatives, including amounts posted for margin, current exposures and future performance with exchanges and independent system operators, may be posted in the form of cash or credit support in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, applicable NEE subsidiaries have posted approximately $\n691\nmillion (\nnone\nat FPL) and $\n1,813\nmillion (\nnone\nat FPL), respectively, in cash and $\n1,595\nmillion (\nnone\nat FPL) and $\n2,806\nmillion (\nnone\nat FPL), respectively, in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds each of which could be applied toward the collateral requirements described above. FPL and NEECH have capacity under their credit facilities generally in excess of the collateral requirements described above that would be available to support, among other things, derivative activities. Under the terms of the credit facilities, maintenance of a specific credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities, although there are other conditions to drawing on these credit facilities.\nAdditionally, some contracts contain certain adequate assurance provisions whereby a counterparty may demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions. Due to the subjective nature of these provisions, NEE and FPL are unable to determine an exact value for these items and they are not included in any of the quantitative disclosures above.\n4.\nNon-Derivative Fair Value Measurements\nNon-derivative fair value measurements consist of NEE’s and FPL’s cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents, special use funds and other investments. The fair value of these financial assets is determined by using the valuation techniques and inputs as described in Note 3 – Fair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments as well as below.\nCash Equivalents\nand Restricted Cash Equivalents\n– NEE and FPL hold investments in money market funds. The fair value of these funds is estimated using a market approach based on current observable market prices.\nSpecial Use Funds and Other Investments\n– NEE and FPL hold primarily debt and equity securities directly, as well as indirectly through commingled funds. Substantially all directly held equity securities are valued at their quoted market prices. For directly held debt securities, multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue of each security. Commingled funds, which are similar to mutual funds, are maintained by banks or investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of objectives. The fair value of commingled funds is primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Because the fund shares are offered to a limited group of investors, they are not considered to be traded in an active market.\nFair Value Measurement Alternative\n–\nNEE holds investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which are initially recorded at cost, of approximately $\n538\nmillion and $\n485\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to carrying values are recorded as a result of observable price changes in transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\nRecurring Non-Derivative Fair Value Measurements\n–\nNEE's and FPL's financial assets and other fair value measurements made on a recurring basis by fair value hierarchy level are as follows:\n86\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n______________________\n(a)\nIncludes restricted cash equivalents of approximately $\n34\nmillion ($\n11\nmillion for FPL) in\ncurrent other assets\non the consolidated balance sheets.\n(b)\nExcludes investments accounted for under the equity method and loans not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. See Fair Value of Financial Instruments Recorded at Other than Fair Value below.\n(c)\nPrimarily invested in commingled funds whose underlying securities would be Level 1 if those securities were held directly by NEE or FPL.\n(d)\nIncluded in noncurrent other assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.\n87\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n______________________\n(a)\nIncludes restricted cash equivalents of approximately $\n69\nmillion ($\n33\nmillion for FPL) in\ncurrent other assets\non the consolidated balance sheets.\n(b)\nExcludes investments accounted for under the equity method and loans not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. See Fair Value of Financial Instruments Recorded at Other than Fair Value below.\n(c)\nPrimarily invested in commingled funds whose underlying securities would be Level 1 if those securities were held directly by NEE or FPL.\n(d)\nIncluded in noncurrent other assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.\nContingent Consideration\n–\nNEER had approximately $\n126\nmillion and $\n203\nmillion of contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are included in noncurrent other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities relate to contingent consideration for the completion of capital expenditures for future development projects in connection with the acquisition\nof GridLiance Holdco, LP and GridLiance GP, LLC (GridLiance) (see Note 6 – GridLiance). The decrease in contingent consideration liabilities is primarily due to a revised assessment of the likelihood of future payments expected under the purchase and sale agreement governing the acquisition of GridLiance. NEECH guarantees the contingent consideration obligations under the GridLiance acquisition agreements. Significant inputs and assumptions used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration, some of which are Level 3 and require judgement, include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows, estimated probability of completing future development projects as well as discount rates.\n88\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments Recorded at Other than Fair Value\n–\nThe carrying amounts of commercial paper and other short-term debt approximate their fair values. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of other financial instruments recorded at other than fair value are as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nPrimarily represents investments accounted for under the equity method and loans not measured at fair value on a recurring basis (Level 2).\n(b)\nApproximately $\n567\nmillion and $\n25\nmillion is included in current other assets and $\n210\nmillion and $\n221\nmillion is included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively (primarily Level 3).\n(c)\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, substantially all is Level 2 for NEE and FPL.\nSpecial Use Funds and Other Investments Carried at Fair Value\n– The special use funds noted above and those carried at fair value (see Recurring Non-Derivative Fair Value Measurements above) consist of NEE's nuclear decommissioning fund assets of approximately $\n8,697\nmillion ($\n6,049\nmillion for FPL) and $\n7,495\nmillion ($\n5,220\nmillion for FPL) at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and FPL's storm fund assets of $\n1\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The investments held in the special use funds and other investments consist of equity and available for sale debt securities which are primarily carried at estimated fair value. The amortized cost of debt securities is approximately $\n3,329\nmillion ($\n1,693\nmillion for FPL) and $\n2,858\nmillion ($\n1,873\nmillion for FPL) at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Debt securities included in the nuclear decommissioning funds have a weighted-average maturity at December 31, 2023 of approximately\nnine years\nat both NEE and FPL. Other investments primarily consist of debt securities with a weighted-average maturity at December 31, 2023 of approximately\nsix years\n. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nFor FPL's special use funds, changes in fair value of debt and equity securities, including any estimated credit losses of debt securities, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts, consistent with regulatory treatment. For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, changes in fair value of debt securities result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for estimated credit losses and unrealized losses on debt securities intended or required to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are recognized in other – net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Changes in fair value of equity securities are primarily recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds – net in NEE’s consolidated statements of income.\nUnrealized gains (losses) recognized on equity securities held at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nRealized gains and losses and proceeds from the sale or maturity of available for sale debt securities are as follows:\n89\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe unrealized gains and unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities and the fair value of available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position are as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nUnrealized losses on available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material to NEE or FPL.\nRegulations issued by the FERC and the NRC provide general risk management guidelines to protect nuclear decommissioning funds and to allow such funds to earn a reasonable return. The FERC regulations prohibit, among other investments, investments in any securities of NEE or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates, excluding investments tied to market indices or mutual funds. Similar restrictions applicable to the decommissioning funds for NEER's nuclear plants are included in the NRC operating licenses for those facilities or in NRC regulations applicable to NRC licensees not in cost-of-service environments. With respect to the decommissioning fund for Seabrook, decommissioning fund contributions and withdrawals are also regulated by the NDFC pursuant to New Hampshire law.\nThe nuclear decommissioning reserve funds are managed by investment managers who must comply with the guidelines of NEE and FPL and the rules of the applicable regulatory authorities. The funds' assets are invested giving consideration to taxes, liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\n– NEE tests its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value. Indicators of impairment may include, among other things, an observable market price below NEE’s carrying value. Investments that are OTTI are written down to their estimated fair value on the reporting date and an impairment loss is recognized.\nNextEra Energy Resources owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP, primarily through its limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo), and accounts for this ownership interest as an equity method investment. During the preparation of NEE’s September 30, 2023 financial statements, it was determined that NextEra Energy Resources’ investment in NEP was OTTI as a result of a significant decline in trading price of NEP's common units during the final three trading days of the third quarter of 2023 following the announcement of a decrease in NEP’s distribution growth rate expectations. The impairment reflected NEE’s fair value analysis using the market approach and the observable trading price of NEP’s common units at September 30, 2023 of $\n29.70\n. When making the OTTI determination, NEE considered, among other things, the extent to which the publicly traded unit price was less than cost. Based on the fair value analysis, the equity method investment with a carrying amount of approximately $\n4.2\nbillion was written down to its estimated fair value of approximately $\n3.0\nbillion, resulting in an impairment charge of $\n1.2\nbillion ($\n0.9\nbillion after tax), which is recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, NextEra Energy Resources recorded an impairment charge of approximately $\n0.8\nbillion ($\n0.6\nbillion after tax) related to an investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (Mountain Valley Pipeline), which is reflected in\nequity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees\nin NEE’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impairment reflected NextEra Energy Resources’ fair value analysis based on the market approach and considered legal and regulatory challenges to the completion of construction and the resulting economic outlook for the pipeline. This impairment charge resulted in the complete write off of NextEra Energy Resources’ equity method investment carrying amount as of March 31, 2022 of approximately $\n0.6\nbillion, as well as the recording of a liability of approximately $\n0.2\nbillion which reflected NextEra Energy Resources’ share of estimated future dismantlement costs.\nThe Mountain Valley Pipeline fair value estimate was based on a probability-weighted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple valuation technique using a market participant view of the potential different outcomes for the investment. As part of the valuation, NextEra Energy Resources used observable inputs where available, including the EBITDA multiples of recent pipeline transactions. Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), including the probabilities assigned to the different potential outcomes, the forecasts of operating revenues and costs, and the projected capital expenditures to complete the project, were also used in the estimation of fair value. An increase in the revenue forecasts, a decrease in the projected operating or capital expenditures or an increase in the probability assigned to the full pipeline being completed would result in an increased fair market value. Changes in the opposite direction of those unobservable inputs would result in a decreased fair market value.\n90\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n6\n.\nAcquisitions\nMerger of FPL and Gulf Power Company\n–\nOn January 1, 2021,\nFPL\nand Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However, during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities\nin the former service areas of FPL and Gulf Power Company\n.\nEffective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one electric ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs. See Note 1 – Rate Regulation – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025.\nAs a result of the merger, FPL acquired assets of approximately $\n6.7\nbillion, primarily relating to property, plant and equipment, net of approximately $\n4.9\nbillion and regulatory assets of $\n1.2\nbillion, and assumed liabilities of approximately $\n3.9\nbillion, including $\n1.8\nbillion of debt, primarily long-term debt, $\n729\nmillion of deferred income taxes and $\n566\nmillion of regulatory liabilities. Additionally, goodwill of approximately $\n2.7\nbillion and purchase accounting adjustments associated with the 2019 Gulf Power Company acquisition by NEE were transferred to FPL from Corporate and Other\nand, for impairment testing, the goodwill is included in the FPL reporting unit.\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed by FPL were at carrying amounts as the merger was between entities under common control.\nGridLiance\n– On March 31, 2021, a wholly owned subsidiary of NEET acquired GridLiance Holdco, LP and GridLiance GP, LLC (GridLiance), which owns and operates\nthree\nFERC-regulated transmission utilities with approximately\n700\nmiles of high-voltage transmission lines across\nsix\nstates,\nfive\nin the Midwest and Nevada. The purchase price included approximately $\n502\nmillion in cash consideration, and the assumption of approximately $\n175\nmillion of debt, excluding post-closing adjustments.\nUnder the acquisition method, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value. The approval by the FERC of GridLiance's rates, which is intended to allow GridLiance to collect total revenues equal to GridLiance's costs for the development, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of GridLiance, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, is considered a fundamental input in measuring the fair value of GridLiance's assets and liabilities and, as such, NEE concluded that the carrying values of all assets and liabilities recoverable through rates are representative of their fair values. As a result, NEE acquired assets of approximately $\n384\nmillion, primarily relating to property, plant and equipment, and assumed liabilities of approximately $\n210\nmillion, primarily relating to long-term debt. The acquisition agreements are subject to earn-out provisions for additional payments, valued at approximately $\n264\nmillion at March 31, 2021, to be made upon the completion of capital expenditures for future development projects (see Note 4 – Contingent Consideration). The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in approximately $\n592\nmillion of goodwill which has been recognized on NEE's consolidated balance sheets, of which approximately $\n586\nmillion is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill associated with the GridLiance acquisition is reflected within NEER and, for impairment testing, is included in the rate-regulated transmission reporting unit. The goodwill arising from the transaction represents expected benefits from continued expansion of NEE's regulated businesses.\nRNG Acquisition\n– On March 21, 2023, a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources acquired a portfolio of renewable energy projects from the owners of Energy Power Partners Fund I, L.P. and North American Sustainable Energy Fund, L.P., as well as the related service provider (RNG Acquisition). The portfolio primarily consisted of\n31\nbiogas projects,\none\nof which is an operating renewable natural gas facility and the others of which are primarily operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities. The purchase price included approximately $\n1.1\nbillion in cash consideration and the assumption of approximately $\n34\nmillion of debt, excluding post-closing adjustments.\nUnder the acquisition method, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value. NEE acquired identifiable assets of approximately $\n1.3\nbillion, primarily relating to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets associated with biogas rights agreements and above-market purchased power agreements, and assumed liabilities of approximately $\n0.3\nbillion and noncontrolling interests of approximately $\n0.1\nbillion. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in approximately $\n0.3\nbillion of goodwill which has been recognized on NEE's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023, of which approximately $\n0.2\nbillion is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill associated with the RNG acquisition is reflected within NEER and, for impairment testing, is expected to be included in the clean energy assets reporting unit. The goodwill arising from the transaction represents expected benefits of synergies and expansion opportunities for NEE's clean energy businesses. The provisional valuation of the acquired net assets, including goodwill, is subject to change as additional information related to the estimates is obtained during the measurement period.\n93\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n7.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consists of the following at December 31:\nFPL\n– At December 31, 2023, FPL's gross investment in electric plant in service and other property for the electric generation, transmission, distribution and general facilities of FPL represented approximately\n43\n%,\n14\n%,\n36\n% and\n7\n%, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2022 were\n44\n%,\n14\n%,\n35\n% and\n7\n%. Substantially all of FPL's properties are subject to the lien of FPL's mortgage, which secures most debt securities issued by FPL. The weighted annual composite depreciation and amortization rate for FPL's electric plant in service, including capitalized software, but excluding the effects of decommissioning, dismantlement and the depreciation adjustments discussed in the following sentences, was approximately\n3.4\n%,\n3.6\n% and\n3.8\n% for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In accordance with the 2021 rate agreement (see Note 1 – Rate Regulation – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025), FPL recorded reserve amortization of approximately $\n227\nmillion in 2023. In 2022, FPL recorded a one-time reserve amortization adjustment of approximately $\n114\nmillion, as required under the 2021 rate agreement, 50% of which was used to reduce the capital recovery regulatory asset balance and the other 50% to increase the storm reserve regulatory liability (see Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery). In accordance with the 2016 rate agreement (see Note 1 – Rate Regulation – Base Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021), FPL recorded reserve amortization of approximately $\n429\nmillion in 2021. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, FPL recorded AFUDC of approximately $\n190\nmillion, $\n136\nmillion and $\n176\nmillion\n,\nrespectively, including the equity component of AFUDC of approximately $\n155\nmillion, $\n105\nmillion and $\n132\nmillion, respectively.\nNEER\n– At December 31, 2023, wind, solar, nuclear and rate-regulated transmission facilities represented approximately\n47\n%,\n18\n%,\n6\n% and\n6\n%, respectively, of NEER's depreciable electric plant in service and other property; the respective amounts at December 31, 2022 were\n51\n%,\n14\n%,\n7\n% and\n7\n%. The estimated useful lives of NEER's plants range primarily from\n30\nto\n35\nyears for wind facilities,\n30\nto\n35\nyears for solar facilities,\n23\nto\n47\nyears for nuclear facilities and\n40\nyears for rate-regulated transmission facilities. NEER's oil and gas production assets represented approximately\n16\n% and\n15\n% of NEER's depreciable electric plant in service and other property at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A number of NEER's generation, regulated transmission and pipeline facilities are encumbered by liens securing various financings. The net book value of NEER's assets serving as collateral was approximately $\n27.8\nbillion at December 31, 2023. Interest capitalized on construction projects amounted to approximately $\n310\nmillion, $\n172\nmillion and $\n139\nmillion during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nJointly-Owned Electric Plants\n–\nCertain NEE subsidiaries own undivided interests in the jointly-owned facilities described below, and are entitled to a proportionate share of the output from those facilities. The subsidiaries are responsible for their share of the operating costs, as well as providing their own financing. Accordingly, each subsidiary's proportionate share of the facilities and related revenues and expenses is included in the appropriate balance sheet and statement of income captions. NEE's and FPL's respective shares of direct expenses for these facilities are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, O&M expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes and other – net in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income.\n94\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNEE's and FPL's proportionate ownership interest in jointly-owned facilities is as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nExcludes nuclear fuel.\n(b)\nFPL retired its share of these units in January 2024. Net book value is reflected in other property on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.\n(c)\nFPL expects to retire this unit in 2028. Net book value is reflected in other property on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.\n8.\nEquity Method Investments\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, NEE's equity method investments totaled approximately $\n6,156\nmillion and $\n6,582\nmillion, respectively. The principal entities included in investment in equity method investees on NEE's consolidated balance sheets are NEP and Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail) (see Note 15 – Contracts), and in 2023 also included Mountain Valley Pipeline (see Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements and Note 15 - Contracts). As of December 31, 2023, NEE's interest in the principal entities range from approximately\n32.8\n% to\n52.6\n%, and these entities primarily own natural gas pipelines or electric generation facilities.\nSummarized combined information for these principal entities is as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nIn 2023, includes approximately $\n450\nmillion of income from discontinued operations related to NEP's sale of natural gas pipelines in December 2023. The income from discontinued operations includes $\n375\nmillion of net gain on disposal.\n(b)\nReflects NEE's interest, as well as third-party interests, in NEP.\n(c)\nIn 2023, approximately $(\n2.4\n) billion is associated with Mountain Valley Pipeline, primarily reflecting impairment charges in 2022 and 2020. In addition, approximately $\n1.1\nbillion in 2023 and $\n2.5\nbillion in 2022 is associated with NEP, of which approximately\n46\n% and\n75\n%, respectively, relates to goodwill and is not being amortized and the remaining balance is being amortized primarily over a period of\n16\nto\n24\nyears. The difference for 2023 reflects the approximately $\n1.2\nbillion impairment charge in 2023 related to NextEra Energy Resources' investment in NEP. See Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\nWith a focus on renewable energy projects, NEP owns, or has a partial ownership interest in, a portfolio of contracted renewable energy assets consisting of wind, solar and battery storage projects as well as a\ncontracted natural gas pipeline\n. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP, primarily through its limited partner interest in NEP OpCo and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment. NEER operates essentially all of the energy projects owned by NEP and provides services to NEP under various related party operations and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements (service agreements). NextEra Energy Resources is also party to a cash sweep and credit support (CSCS) agreement with a subsidiary of NEP. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the cash sweep amounts (due to NEP and its subsidiaries) held in accounts belonging to NextEra Energy Resources or its subsidiaries were approximately $\n1,511\nmillion and $\n298\nmillion, respectively, and are included in accounts payable. Fee income related to the CSCS agreement and the service agreements totaled approximately $\n59\nmillion, $\n174\nmillion and $\n148\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included\n95\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nin operating revenues in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Amounts due from NEP of approximately $\n84\nmillion and $\n94\nmillion are included in other receivables and $\n114\nmillion and $\n101\nmillion are included in noncurrent other assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See also Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests for amounts due to NEP for reimbursement of construction-related costs. NEECH or NextEra Energy Resources guaranteed or provided indemnifications, letters of credit or surety bonds totaling approximately $\n2.3\nbillion at December 31, 2023 primarily related to obligations on behalf of NEP's subsidiaries with maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2059, including certain project performance obligations and obligations under financing and interconnection agreements. Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded on NEE’s consolidated balance sheets at fair value. At December 31, 2023, approximately $\n60\nmillion related to the fair value of the credit support provided under the CSCS agreement is recorded as noncurrent other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, certain services, primarily engineering, construction, transportation, storage and maintenance services, were provided to subsidiaries of NEE by related parties that NEE accounts for under the equity method of accounting. Charges for these services amounted to approximately $\n656\nmillion, $\n579\nmillion and $\n691\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n9.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nNEER\n– At December 31, 2023, NEE consolidates a number of VIEs within the NEER segment. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment are considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since they control the most significant activities of these VIEs, including operations and maintenance, and they have the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs.\nEight\nindirect subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have an ownership interest ranging from approximately\n50\n% to\n67\n% in entities which own and operate solar generation facilities with generating capacity of approximately\n765\nMW. Each of the subsidiaries is considered a VIE since the non-managing members have no substantive rights over the managing members, and is consolidated by NextEra Energy Resources. These entities sell their electric output to third parties under power sales contracts with expiration dates ranging from 2035 through 2052. These entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the assets of the entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs were approximately $\n1,796\nmillion and $\n1,085\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2023. There were\nnine\nof these consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2022 and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs at such date totaled approximately $\n2,084\nmillion and $\n1,174\nmillion, respectively. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the assets and liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.\nNEE consolidates a NEET VIE which owns and operates an approximately\n280\n-mile electric transmission line that went into service during the first quarter of 2022. A NEET subsidiary is the primary beneficiary and controls the most significant activities of the VIE. NEET is entitled to receive\n48\n% of the profits and losses of the entity. The assets and liabilities of the VIE totaled approximately $\n741\nmillion and $\n347\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2023, and $\n744\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the assets and liabilities of this VIE consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and, in 2023, long-term debt.\nNextEra Energy Resources consolidates a VIE which has a\n10\n% direct ownership interest in wind and solar generation facilities which have the capability of producing approximately\n400\nMW and\n599\nMW, respectively. These entities sell their electric output under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2025 through 2040. These entities are also considered a VIE because the holders of differential membership interests in these entities do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities. The assets and liabilities of the VIE were approximately $\n1,434\nmillion and $\n79\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2023, and $\n1,488\nmillion and $\n86\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the assets of this VIE consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment.\nNextEra Energy Resources consolidates\n33\nVIEs that primarily relate to certain subsidiaries which have sold differential membership interests in entities which own and operate wind generation, solar generation and battery storage facilities with generating/storage capacity of approximately\n12,824\nMW,\n2,438\nMW and\n1,062\nMW, respectively, and own wind generation, solar generation and battery storage facilities that, upon completion of construction, which is anticipated in 2024, are expected to have generating/storage capacity of approximately\n303\nMW,\n1,012\nMW and\n15\nMW, respectively. These entities sell, or will sell, their electric output either under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2024 through 2053 or in the spot market. These entities are considered VIEs because the holders of differential membership interests do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities. NextEra Energy Resources has financing obligations with respect to these entities, including third-party debt which is secured by liens against the generation facilities and the other assets of these entities or by pledges of NextEra Energy Resources' ownership interest in these entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NEER for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs totaled approximately $\n24,250\nmillion and $\n3,148\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2023. There were\n31\nof these consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2022 and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs at such date totaled approximately $\n19,690\nmillion and $\n2,318\n96\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nmillion, respectively. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the assets and liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and accounts payable.\nOther\n– At December 31, 2023 and 2022, several NEE subsidiaries had investments totaling approximately $\n4,962\nmillion ($\n3,899\nmillion at FPL) and $\n4,016\nmillion ($\n3,331\nmillion at FPL), respectively, which are included in special use funds and noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's consolidated balance sheets. These investments represented primarily commingled funds and asset-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not involved in the initial design of these entities and do not have a controlling financial interest in these entities.\nCertain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in NEP OpCo (see Note 8). These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered VIEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE’s investment in these entities totaled approximately $\n3,913\nmillion and $\n5,214\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2023, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $\n180\nmillion in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 – Commitments and – Contracts, respectively.\n10.\nLeases\nNEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, buildings, equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to\nthree\nland use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to\n30\nyears and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. At December 31, 2023, NEE’s\nROU assets\nand\nlease liabilities\nfor operating leases totaled approximately $\n396\nmillion and $\n412\nmillion, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2022 were $\n386\nmillion and $\n400\nmillion. At December 31, 2023, NEE’s\nROU assets\nand\nlease liabilities\nfor finance leases totaled approximately $\n440\nmillion and $\n444\nmillion, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2022 were $\n378\nmillion and $\n375\nmillion. NEE’s lease liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of\n3.96\n% and\n3.66\n%, respectively, for operating leases and\n4.32\n% and\n3.98\n%, respectively, for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of\n44\nyears and\n45\nyears, respectively, for operating leases and\n32\nyears and\n33\nyears, respectively, for finance leases. At December 31, 2023, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $\n1.7\nbillion with no one year being material. Operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to certain battery storage facilities and a natural gas and oil electric generation facility that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. At December 31, 2023, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2024 to 2043 and NEE expects to receive approximately $\n2.8\nbillion of lease payments over the remaining terms of the power sales agreements with no one year being material. Operating and sales-type lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or balance sheets for the periods presented.\n11.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. For NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the accounting provisions result in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset retirement costs for financial reporting purposes and the method the regulator allows for recovery in rates. See Note 1 – Rate Regulation and – Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs.\n97\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nA rollforward of NEE's and FPL's AROs is as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nIncludes approximately $\n18\nmillion and $\n27\nmillion related to project sales to NEP as well as other sales of businesses and assets during the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests.\n(b)\nIncludes the current portion of AROs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 of approximately $\n34\nmillion ($\n27\nmillion for FPL) and\n$\n83\nmillion\n($\n68\nmillion for FPL), respectively, which are included in other current liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.\nRestricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission NEE's and FPL's nuclear units included in special use funds on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets are presented below (see Note 4). Duane Arnold is being actively decommissioned and was granted an exemption from the NRC, which allows for use of the funds for certain other site restoration activities in addition to decommissioning obligations recorded as AROs.\nNEE and FPL have identified but not recognized ARO liabilities related to the majority of their electric transmission and distribution assets and pipelines resulting from easements over property not owned by NEE or FPL. These easements are generally perpetual and only require retirement action upon abandonment or cessation of use of the property or facility for its specified purpose. The related ARO liability is not estimable for such easements as NEE and FPL intend to use these properties indefinitely. In the event NEE or FPL decide to abandon or cease the use of a particular easement, an ARO liability would be recorded at that time.\n12.\nEmployee Retirement Benefits\nEmployee Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plans\n– NEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. NEE also has a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP), which includes a non-qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees, and sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for other benefits for retirees of NEE and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements. The total accrued benefit cost of the SERP and postretirement plans is approximately $\n231\nmillion ($\n101\nmillion for FPL) and $\n237\nmillion ($\n115\nmillion for FPL) at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n98\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

These rates are used in determining net periodic pension income in the following year.\nNEE's investment policy for the pension plan recognizes the benefit of protecting the plan's funded status, thereby avoiding the necessity of future employer contributions. Its broad objectives are to achieve a high rate of total return with a prudent level of risk taking while maintaining sufficient liquidity and diversification to avoid large losses and preserve capital over the long term.\n99\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe NEE pension plan fund's current target asset allocation, which is expected to be reached over time, is\n43\n% equity investments,\n32\n% fixed income investments,\n20\n% alternative investments and\n5\n% convertible securities. The pension fund's investment strategy emphasizes traditional investments, broadly diversified across the global equity and fixed income markets, using a combination of different investment styles and vehicles. The pension fund's equity and fixed income holdings consist of both directly held securities as well as commingled investment arrangements such as common and collective trusts, pooled separate accounts, registered investment companies and limited partnerships. The pension fund's convertible security assets are principally direct holdings of convertible securities and include a convertible security oriented limited partnership. The pension fund's alternative investments consist primarily of private equity and real estate oriented investments in limited partnerships as well as absolute return oriented limited partnerships that use a broad range of investment strategies on a global basis.\nThe fair value measurements of NEE's pension plan assets by fair value hierarchy level are as follows:\n_____________________\n(a)\nSee Note 3 and Note 4 for discussion of fair value measurement techniques and inputs.\n(b)\nIncludes foreign investments of $\n591\nmillion.\n(c)\nIncludes foreign investments of $\n222\nmillion.\n(d)\nIncludes foreign investments of $\n72\nmillion.\n(e)\nIncludes foreign investments of $\n157\nmillion.\n(f)\nIncludes foreign investments of $\n2\nmillion.\n(g)\nIncludes foreign investments of $\n21\nmillion.\n(h)\nIncludes foreign investments of $\n2\nmillion.\n(i)\nIncludes foreign investments of $\n240\nmillion.\n100\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

NEE makes matching contributions to participants' accounts. Defined contribution expense pursuant to this plan was approximately $\n78\nmillion, $\n68\nmillion and $\n66\nmillion for NEE ($\n43\nmillion, $\n41\nmillion and $\n42\nmillion for FPL) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n102\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n13.\nDebt\nLong-term debt consists of the following:\n______________________\n(a)\nIncludes tax exempt bonds that permit individual bondholders to tender the bonds for purchase at any time prior to maturity. In the event these tax exempt bonds are tendered for purchase, they would be remarketed by a designated remarketing agent in accordance with the related indenture. If the remarketing is unsuccessful, FPL would be required to purchase these tax exempt bonds. At December 31, 2023, these tax exempt bonds totaled approximately $\n1,319\nmillion. All tax exempt bonds tendered for purchase have been successfully remarketed. FPL's syndicated revolving credit facilities are available to support the purchase of the tax exempt bonds. Variable interest rate is established at various intervals by the remarketing agent.\n(b)\nAt December 31, 2023, includes approximately $\n1,812\nmillion of floating rate notes that permit individual noteholders to require repayment at specified dates prior to maturity. FPL’s syndicated revolving credit facilities are available to support the purchase of the floating rate notes.\n(c)\nVariable rate is based on an underlying index plus a specified margin.\n(d)\nInterest rate contracts, primarily swaps, have been entered into with respect to certain of these debt issuances. See Note 3.\n(e)\nForeign currency contracts have been entered into with respect to these debt issuances. See Note 3. The Japanese yen denominated long-term debt includes a variable rate loan that matured in 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, minimum annual maturities of long\n-\nterm debt for NEE are approximately $\n6,901\nmillion, $\n8,037\nmillion, $\n1,874\nmillion, $\n7,731\nmillion and $\n7,685\nmillion for 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively. The respective amounts for FPL are approximately $\n1,665\nmillion, $\n1,920\nmillion, $\n641\nmillion, $\n328\nmillion and $\n1,992\nmillion.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, short-term borrowings had a weighted-average interest rate of\n5.62\n% (\n5.50\n% for FPL) and\n4.58\n% (\n4.41\n% for FPL), respectively. Subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, had credit facilities with total capacity at December 31, 2023 of approximately $\n19.6\nbillion ($\n4.0\nbillion for FPL) which provide for the funding of loans and/or issuance of letters of\n103\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ncredit. At December 31, 2023, letters of credit outstanding under these credit facilities totaled approximately $\n3.4\nbillion ($\n3\nmillion for FPL) and borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities totaled $\n255\nmillion ($\n255\nmillion for FPL).\nBetween\nJanuary 1, 2024 and February 16, 2024, NEE's credit facilities' total capacity increased $\n900\nmillion ($\n500\nmillion for FPL) and borrowings under its credit facilities increased $\n1,650\nmillion ($\n0\nfor FPL). In January 2024, FPL received $\n3.4\nbillion of capital contributions from NEE which were used to repay commercial paper and $\n1.0\nbillion of senior unsecured notes.\nNEE has guaranteed certain payment obligations of NEECH, including most of those under NEECH's debt, including all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications. NEECH has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of subsidiaries within the NEER segment.\nIn August 2022, NEECH completed a remarketing of $\n1.5\nbillion aggregate principal amount of its Series J Debentures due September 1, 2024 that were issued in September 2019 as components of equity units issued concurrently by NEE (September 2019 equity units). The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE. In connection with the remarketing of the debentures, the interest rate on the debentures was reset to\n4.255\n% per year, and interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing September 1, 2022. In connection with the settlement of the contracts to purchase NEE common stock that were issued as components of the September 2019 equity units, on September 1, 2022, NEE issued approximately\n21.6\nmillion shares of common stock in exchange for $\n1.5\nbillion.\nIn March 2023, NEECH completed a remarketing of $\n2.5\nbillion aggregate principal amount of its Series K Debentures due March 1, 2025 that were issued in February 2020 as components of equity units issued concurrently by NEE (February 2020 equity units). The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE. In connection with the remarketing of the debentures, the interest rate on the debentures was reset to\n6.051\n% per year, and interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing September 1, 2023. In connection with the settlement of the contracts to purchase NEE common stock that were issued as components of the February 2020 equity units, on March 1, 2023, NEE issued approximately\n33.4\nmillion shares of common stock in exchange for $\n2.5\nbillion.\nIn August 2023, NEECH completed a remarketing of $\n2.0\nbillion aggregate principal amount of its Series L Debentures due September 1, 2025 that were issued in September 2020 as components of equity units issued concurrently by NEE (September 2020 equity units). The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE. In connection with the remarketing of the debentures, the interest rate on the debentures was reset to\n5.749\n% per year, and interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing September 1, 2023. In connection with the settlement of the contracts to purchase NEE common stock that were issued as components of the September 2020 equity units, on September 1, 2023, NEE issued approximately\n27.3\nmillion shares of common stock in exchange for $\n2.0\nbillion.\nIn September 2022, NEE sold $\n2.0\nbillion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $\n50\nand consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a\n5\n% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series M Debenture due September 1, 2027, issued in the principal amount of $\n1,000\nby NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than September 1, 2025 (the final settlement date) for a price of $\n50\nin cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments) based on a price per share range described in the following sentence. If purchased on the final settlement date, as of December 31, 2023, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from\n0.5640\nshares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to $\n88.88\n(the reference price) to\n0.4512\nshares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than $\n111.10\n(the threshold appreciation price), with the applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a\n20\n-day trading period ending August 27, 2025. Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of\n6.926\n%, consisting of interest on the debentures (\n4.60\n% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (\n2.326\n% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after March 1, 2025. A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock purchase contract with cash, the debentures that are components of the Corporate Units will be used to satisfy in full the holders' obligations to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contracts on the final settlement date. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\nPrior to the issuance of NEE’s common stock, the stock purchase contracts, if dilutive, will be reflected in NEE’s diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of NEE common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued upon settlement of the stock purchase contracts over the number of shares that could be purchased by NEE in the market, at the average market price during the period, using the proceeds receivable upon settlement.\n104\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOn January 31, 2024, NEECH sold a total of $\n3.8\nbillion principal amount of its debentures, with interest rates ranging from\n4.90\n% to\n5.55\n% and maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2054, and $\n600\nmillion of its floating rate debentures due in 2026.\n14.\nEquity\nEarnings Per Share\n–\nThe reconciliation of NEE's basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to NEE is as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nCalculated using the treasury stock method. Performance share awards are included in diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding based upon what would be issued if the end of the reporting period was the end of the term of the award.\nCommon shares issuable pursuant to equity units, stock options and/or performance share awards, as well as restricted stock which were not included in the denominator above due to their antidilutive effect were approximately\n39.1\nmillion,\n38.1\nmillion and\n30.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP\n– NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In December 2022, June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $\n500\nmillion, $\n500\nmillion and $\n600\nmillion respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions\n– NEE's charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. FPL's mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\nStock-Based Compensation\n– Net income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 includes approximately $\n139\nmillion, $\n142\nmillion and $\n119\nmillion, respectively, of compensation costs and $\n26\nmillion, $\n20\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was not material. At December 31, 2023, there were approximately $\n198\nmillion of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n2.2\nyears.\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately\n74\nmillion shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but\nno\nadditional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards\n– Restricted stock typically vests within\nthree years\nafter the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a\nthree-year\nperformance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n105\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2023 was as follows:\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock granted for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n75.13\nand $\n82.69\n, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of performance share awards granted for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n58.67\nand $\n54.82\n, respectively.\nThe total fair value of restricted stock and performance share awards vested was $\n106\nmillion, $\n175\nmillion and $\n186\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOptions – Options typically vest within\nthree years\nafter the date of grant and have a maximum term of\nten years\n. The exercise price of each option granted equals the closing market price of NEE common stock on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of the options is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and based on the following assumptions:\n______________________\n(a)\nBased on historical experience.\n(b)\nBased on historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation experience adjusted for outstanding awards.\nOption activity for the year ended December 31, 2023 was as follows:\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted was $\n14.46\n, $\n10.49\nand $\n9.82\nper share for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was approximately $\n22\nmillion, $\n37\nmillion and $\n49\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n106\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nCash received from option exercises was approximately $\n14\nmillion, $\n14\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The tax benefits realized from options exercised were approximately $\n5\nmillion, $\n9\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPreferred Stock\n– NEE's charter authorizes the issuance of\n100\nmillion shares of serial preferred stock, $\n0.01\npar value,\nnone\nof which are outstanding. FPL's charter authorizes the issuance of\n10,414,100\nshares of preferred stock, $\n100\npar value,\n5\nmillion shares of subordinated preferred stock,\nno\npar value, and\n5\nmillion shares of preferred stock,\nno\npar value,\nnone\nof which are outstanding.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n–\nThe components of AOCI, net of tax, are as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nReclassified to interest expense in NEE's consolidated statements of income. See Note 3 – Income Statement Impact of Derivative Instruments.\n(b)\nReclassified to gains on disposal of investments and other property – net in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n(c)\nReclassified to other net periodic benefit income in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n107\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n15.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\n– NEE and its subsidiaries have made commitments in connection with a portion of their projected capital expenditures. Capital expenditures at FPL include, among other things, the cost for construction of additional facilities and equipment to meet customer demand, as well as capital improvements to and maintenance of existing facilities. At NEER, capital expenditures include, among other things, the cost, including capitalized interest, for development, construction and maintenance of its competitive energy businesses. Also see Note 4 – Contingent Consideration.\nAt December 31, 2023, estimated capital expenditures, on an accrual basis, for 2024 through 2028\nwere as follows:\n______________________\n(a)\nIncludes AFUDC of approximately $\n135\nmillion, $\n115\nmillion, $\n165\nmillion, $\n160\nmillion and $\n145\nmillion for 2024 through 2028, respectively.\n(b)\nIncludes land, generation structures, transmission interconnection and integration and licensing.\n(c)\nIncludes AFUDC of approximately $\n95\nmillion, $\n90\nmillion, $\n100\nmillion, $\n90\nmillion and $\n65\nmillion for 2023 through 2027, respectively.\n(d)\nRepresents capital expenditures for which applicable internal approvals and also, if required, regulatory approvals have been received.\n(e)\nConsists of capital expenditures for new wind projects and repowering of existing wind projects totaling approximately\n2,621\nMW, and related transmission.\n(f)\nIncludes capital expenditures for new solar projects (including solar plus battery storage projects) totaling approximately\n6,134\nMW and related transmission.\n(g)\nIncludes capital expenditures primarily for battery storage projects and renewable fuels projects.\n(h)\nIncludes AFUDC of approximately $\n30\nmillion, $\n70\nmillion, $\n145\nmillion, $\n105\nmillion and $\n65\nmillion for 2024 through 2028, respectively.\n(i)\nIncludes equity contributions in 2024 for the construction of Mountain Valley Pipeline.\nThe above estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from these estimates.\nIn addition to guarantees noted in Note 8 with regards to NEP, NEECH has guaranteed or provided indemnifications or letters of credit related to third parties, including certain obligations of investments in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, totaling approximately $\n480\nmillion at December 31, 2023. These obligations primarily related to guaranteeing the residual value of certain financing leases. Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded at fair value and are included in noncurrent other liabilities on NEE’s consolidated balance sheets. Management believes that the exposure associated with these guarantees is not material.\nContracts\n– In addition to the commitments made in connection with the estimated capital expenditures included in the table in Commitments above, FPL has firm commitments under long-term contracts primarily for the transportation of natural gas with expiration dates through 2042.\nAt December 31, 2023, NEER has entered into contracts with expiration dates through 2033 primarily for the purchase of wind turbines, wind towers and solar modules and related construction and development activities, as well as for the supply of uranium, and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel. Approximately $\n4.4\nbillion of related commitments are included in the estimated capital expenditures table in Commitments above. In addition, NEER has contracts primarily for the transportation and storage of natural gas with expiration dates through 2044.\n108\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe required capacity and/or minimum payments under contracts, including those discussed above at December 31, 2023, were estimated as follows:\n_______________________\n(a)\nIncludes approximately $\n410\nmillion, $\n405\nmillion, $\n400\nmillion, $\n400\nmillion, $\n400\nmillion and $\n5,160\nmillion in 2024 through 2028 and thereafter, respectively, of firm commitments related to the natural gas transportation agreements with Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection, LLC. The charges associated with these agreements are recoverable through the fuel clause and totaled approximately $\n417\nmillion, $\n418\nmillion and $\n419\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $\n99\nmillion, $\n102\nmillion and $\n105\nmillion, respectively, were eliminated in consolidation at NEE.\n(b)\nIncludes equity contributions in 2024 and a\n20\n-year natural gas transportation agreement (approximately $\n70\nmillion per year) with Mountain Valley Pipeline, a joint venture, in which NEER has a\n32.8\n% equity investment, that is constructing a natural gas pipeline. The transportation agreement commitments are subject to the completion of construction\n.\n(c)\nIncludes approximately $\n230\nmillion of commitments to invest in technology and other investments through 2031. See Note 9 – Other.\n(d)\nIncludes approximately $\n1,065\nmillion, $\n40\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion for 2024 through 2026, respectively, of joint obligations of NEECH and NEER.\nInsurance\n– Liability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains $\n500\nmillion of private liability insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, except at Duane Arnold which obtained an exemption from the NRC and maintains a $\n100\nmillion private liability insurance limit. Each site, except Duane Arnold, participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to $\n15.8\nbillion of liability insurance coverage per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of up to $\n1,161\nmillion ($\n664\nmillion for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S., payable at a rate not to exceed $\n173\nmillion ($\n99\nmillion for FPL) per incident per year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $\n20\nmillion and $\n25\nmillion, plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively.\nNEE participates in a nuclear insurance mutual company that provides $\n2.75\nbillion of limited insurance coverage per occurrence per site for property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning risks at its nuclear plants and a sublimit of $\n1.5\nbillion for non-nuclear perils, except for Duane Arnold which has a limit of $\n50\nmillion for property damage, decontamination risks and non-nuclear perils. NEE participates in co-insurance of\n10\n% of the first $\n400\nmillion of losses per site per occurrence, except at Duane Arnold. The proceeds from such insurance, however, must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination before they can be used for plant repair. NEE also participates in an insurance program that provides limited coverage for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is out of service for an extended period of time because of an accident. In the event of an accident at one of NEE's or another participating insured's nuclear plants, NEE could be assessed up to $\n161\nmillion ($\n102\nmillion for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in retrospective premiums in a policy year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $\n2\nmillion, $\n2\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion, plus any applicable taxes, respectively.\nDue to the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, NEE does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of either its transmission and distribution property or natural gas pipeline assets. If FPL's storm restoration costs exceed the storm reserve, such storm restoration costs may be recovered, subject to prudence review by the FPSC, through surcharges approved by the FPSC or through securitization provisions pursuant to Florida law. See Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\nIn the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of FPL, would be borne by NEE and FPL and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n109\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nLegal Proceedings –\nFPL is the defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in February 2018 that seeks from FPL unspecified damages for alleged breach of contract and gross negligence based on service interruptions that occurred as a result of Hurricane Irma in 2017. There is currently no trial date set. The Miami-Dade County Circuit Court certified the case as a class action and FPL's appeal of that decision was denied by Florida's Third District Court of Appeal (3\nrd\nDCA) in March 2023. The certified class encompasses all persons and business owners who reside in and are otherwise citizens of the state of Florida that contracted with FPL for electrical services, were charged storm charges, experienced a power outage after Hurricane Irma and suffered consequential damages because of FPL’s alleged breach of contract or gross negligence. FPL filed a motion on March 31, 2023, for rehearing with the 3\nrd\nDCA claiming that the opinion upholding the class certification contains several errors that should be reheard by the full 3\nrd\nDCA. The motion is pending. Additionally, in July 2023, FPL filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis that, among other things, it believes the FPSC has exclusive jurisdiction over any issues arising from a utility's preparation for and response to emergencies or disasters. FPL is vigorously defending against the claims in this proceeding.\nNEE, FPL, and certain current and former executives, are the named defendants in a purported shareholder securities class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in June 2023 and amended in December 2023 that seeks from the defendants unspecified damages allegedly resulting from alleged false or misleading statements regarding NEE's alleged campaign finance and other political activities. The alleged class of plaintiffs are all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired NEE securities between December 2, 2021 and January 30, 2023. NEE is vigorously defending against the claims in this proceeding.\nNEE, along with certain current and former executives and directors are the named defendants in purported shareholder derivative actions filed in the 15th Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach County, Florida in July 2023, and in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in October 2023 and November 2023 (which were consolidated in January 2024) seeking unspecified damages allegedly resulting from, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duties and, in the consolidated cases, violations of the federal securities laws, all purporting to relate to alleged campaign finance law violations and associated matters. Defendants are vigorously defending against the claims in these proceedings. In January 2024, NEE and the plaintiffs in the derivative actions agreed to a specified stay in these cases. NEE also has received demand letters and books and records requests from counsel representing other purported shareholders and containing similar allegations. These demands seek, among other things, a Board of Directors investigation of, and/or documentation regarding, these allegations. NEE and two of the shareholders demanding an investigation have agreed to a specified stay of all material activities related to the demand.\nIn September 2023, a participant in the NEE Employee Retirement Savings Plan (Plan), purportedly on behalf of the Plan and all persons who were participants in or beneficiaries of the Plan, at any time between September 25, 2016 and September 25, 2023 (Plan participants), filed a putative ERISA class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against NEE. The complaint alleges that NEE violated its fiduciary duties under the Plan by permitting a third-party administrative recordkeeper to charge allegedly excessive fees for the services provided and allegedly by allowing a large volume of plan assets to be invested in NEE common stock. The plaintiff seeks declaratory, equitable and monetary relief on behalf of the Plan and Plan participants. NEE and the plaintiff have agreed to a specified stay of the action to permit the plaintiff to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him under the Plan.\n16.\nSegment Information\nThe tables below present information for NEE's two reportable segments, FPL, a rate-regulated utility business, and NEER, which is comprised of competitive energy and rate-regulated transmission businesses.

The amounts presented below reflect allocations from NEE for FPL's portion of the fees, as well as amounts billed directly to FPL.\n______________________\n(a)\nAudit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of FPL's and NEE's annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the reviews of the financial statements included in FPL's and NEE's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q during the fiscal year and the audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, comfort letters, and consents.\n(b)\nAudit-related fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of FPL's and NEE's consolidated financial statements and are not reported under audit fees. These fees primarily relate to audits of subsidiary financial statements and financial systems pre-implementation internal control assessment.\n(c)\nTax fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. These fees primarily relate to research and development tax credit advice and planning services.\n(d)\nAll other fees consist of fees for products and services other than the services reported under the other named categories. In 2023, these fees relate to training and advisory services for IT job architecture and skills descriptions, and in 2022, these fees relate to training and advisory services for Human Resources optimization.\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit Committee Charter and the Audit Committee's pre-approval policy for services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, all services performed by Deloitte & Touche are approved in advance by the Audit Committee, except for audits of certain trust funds where the fees are paid by the trust. Permitted services specifically identified in an appendix to the pre-approval policy are pre-approved by the Audit Committee each year. This pre-approval allows management to request the specified permitted services on an as-needed basis during the year, provided any such services are reviewed with the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Any permitted service for which the fee is expected to exceed $500,000, or that involves a service not listed on the pre-approval list, must be specifically approved by the Audit Committee prior to commencement of such service. The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chair of the committee the right to approve audit, audit-related, tax and other services, within certain limitations, between meetings of the Audit Committee, provided any such decision is presented to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. At each Audit Committee meeting (other than meetings held to review earnings materials), the Audit Committee reviews a schedule of services for which Deloitte & Touche has been engaged since the prior Audit Committee meeting under existing pre-approvals and the estimated fees for those services. In 2023 and 2022, none of the amounts presented above represent services provided to NEE or FPL by Deloitte & Touche that were approved by the Audit Committee after services were rendered pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X\n(which provides for a waiver of the otherwise applicable pre-approval requirement if certain conditions are met).\n115\nPART IV"
