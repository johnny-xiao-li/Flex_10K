BD Life Sciences consists of the following organizational units:\n2\nBD Interventional\nBD Interventional provides vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products that are intended to be used once and then discarded or are either temporarily or permanently implanted.  The primary customers served by BD Interventional are hospitals\n, ambulatory surgery centers, individ\nual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities, alternate site facilities, and patients via our Homecare business.  BD Interventional consists of the following organizational units:\nAcquisitions\nEdwards Lifesciences’ Critical Care Product Group\nOn September 3, 2024, BD completed the acquisition of Critical Care, which was renamed as BD Advanced Patient Monitoring. The fair value of consideration transferred in connection with the acquisition was $3.911 billion. Since the acquisition date, financial results for Advanced Patient Monitoring’s product offerings are being reported as a separate organizational unit within the Medical segment. BD funded the transaction with cash on hand, using net proceeds raised through debt issuances in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, as further discussed in Note 16, and borrowings under our commercial paper program. Additional information regarding this acquisition is contained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nParata\nOn July 18, 2022, BD completed the acquisition of Parata Systems (“Parata”), an innovative provider of pharmacy automation solutions. The fair value of consideration transferred  in connection with the acquisition was $1.548 billion. Since the acquisition date, financial results for Parata's product offerings are being reported within results for the Medical segment’s Medication Management Solutions unit. Additional information regarding this acquisition is contained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n3\nDivestitures\nSurgical Instrumentation Platform\nIn August 2023, BD completed the sale of the Interventional segment’s Surgical Instrumentation platform pursuant to a definitive agreement that was signed in June 2023. BD recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $268 million, which was recorded as a component of\nOther operating expense (income), net\nin fiscal year 2023. The historical financial results for the Surgical Instrumentation platform have not been classified as a discontinued operation. Additional information regarding this divestiture is contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nSpin-Off of Diabetes Care\nOn April 1, 2022, BD completed the separation and distribution of Embecta Corp. (“Embecta”), formerly BD's Diabetes Care business, into a separate, publicly-traded company.  The historical results of the Diabetes Care business (previously included in BD’s Medical segment), as well as interest expense related to indebtedness incurred by Embecta prior to the spin-off date, have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the spin-off date of April 1, 2022. Additional disclosures regarding our spin-off of the Diabetes Care business are provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nInternational Operations\nBD’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. For reporting purposes, we organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, and Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada. BD has manufacturing operations outside the United States in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, China, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Geographic information with respect to BD’s operations is included under the heading “Geographic Information” in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nForeign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues. BD believes its activities in some countries outside the United States involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein. See further discussion of these risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nDistribution\nBD’s products are marketed and distributed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels, as well as directly to hospitals and other healthcare related institutions by BD and independent sales representatives. BD uses acute care, non-acute care, laboratory and drug wholesaler distributors to broadly support our overall disposable product demand from our end user customers in the United States, while our capital equipment is mostly sold direct to our end user customers.  In international markets, products are distributed either directly or through distributors, with the practice varying by country. BD’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal, with the exception of certain medical devices in the Medication Delivery Solutions business unit, and flu diagnostic products in the Integrated Diagnostic Systems business unit, both of which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza.  BD operates consolidated distribution facilities globally in order to better service its customers, optimize logistics, lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels.\n4\nRaw Materials and Components\nBD purchases many different types of raw materials and components, including plastics, glass, metals, textiles, paper products, agricultural products, electronic and mechanical sub-assemblies and various biological, chemical and petrochemical products. BD seeks to ensure continuity of supply by securing multiple options for sourcing. However, there are situations where raw materials and components are only available from one supplier, which are referred to as sole sourced. The use of sole sourced materials and components may be due to sourcing of proprietary and/or patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product. In other cases, while a raw material or component can be sourced from multiple manufacturers, only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance, cost or other considerations. In order to provide alternate sources, BD must complete a rigorous qualification process, which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval. If clinical trials are not required, this qualification process can take 3-18 months depending on the criticality of the change. When clinical trials are required, this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years. BD continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and components, and maintains business continuity plans with its suppliers. BD’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers, qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities, maintaining contingency stock, internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts. While BD works closely with its suppliers, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful, and there may be events that cause supply interruption, reduction or termination that adversely impact BD’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products. See further discussion of the risks related to the supply chain and raw materials in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nResearch and Development\nBD conducts its research and development (“R&D”) activities at its operating units and across global enterprise centers of excellence located in the United States, India, China, Singapore and Ireland. The majority of BD’s R&D activities are conducted in North America. Outside North America, BD has a significant R&D presence in Greater Asia and Europe. BD also collaborates with certain universities, medical centers and other entities on R&D programs and retains individual consultants and partners to support its efforts in specialized fields.\nIntellectual Property and Licenses\nBD owns significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries. BD is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks owned by others. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to BD’s business. BD believes, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to BD’s business as a whole, or to any business segment.\nCompetition\nBD operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology, the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous, and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market. Companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field. Some are more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets, and some have greater financial resources than BD. New companies have entered the field, particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics, non-traditional point of care and at-home testing, safety-engineered devices and in the life sciences. Additionally, established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area. Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well. Acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment. In addition, the entry into the market of low-\n5\ncost manufacturers has created increased pricing pressures.  BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors, including price, quality, innovation, service, reputation, distribution and promotion. The impact of these factors on BD’s competitive position varies among BD’s various product offerings. In order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates and to boost supply reliability and productivity, BD continues to make investments in R&D, quality management, quality improvement, product innovation, manufacturing and supply chain.  See further discussion of the risks relating to competition in the medical technology industry in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nMarket Access and Third-Party Reimbursement\nBD’s customers and their patients rely on public and private payers to reimburse some or all the cost of procedures, products and services. BD actively engages with the payer community, medical societies and other stakeholders in order to navigate market access trends and appropriately communicate value propositions for a broad range of BD medical technologies. However, BD has no direct control over payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for BD products.\nThe manner and level of reimbursement is determined at the payer’s discretion and may depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to site of care, procedure(s) performed, patient diagnosis, the device(s) and/or drug(s) utilized, available budget, health equity, beneficiary access or a combination of these factors. The providers that we serve are also evaluating changes in the healthcare reimbursement landscape and coverage elements leading to their own decision-making on what they will ultimately pay for various medical technologies or procedures, which could positively or negatively impact sales of BD products in any given country for any given product at any given time.\nVertical integration of health systems has created a concentrated market among commercial payers in the U.S. and there is an increased focus globally on payment policies that serve to control healthcare spending while also rewarding quality and patient outcomes. Governments around the world continue to consider and transition to value-based payment reforms that would drive improved value and quality- and resource-based reimbursement. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS) established a 2030 goal of transitioning all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries to a “care relationship” to ensure the agency’s accountability of quality and cost of care. Whether these changes are driven by legislative efforts, strategic alliances or market conditions, the global landscape continues to enhance cost control efforts through “pay for performance” mechanisms and bidding and tender policies that focus on quality and performance.\nExamining reimbursement and continually assessing the broader healthcare funding landscape is a strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical technology. Advancing coding, coverage and payment strategies reduce barriers to adoption, improve affordability and are critical to ensuring patient and provider access to medical technologies. Market access strategies are also critical in ensuring commercial priorities are meeting the demand for critical healthcare needs globally and locally.\nRegulation\nGeneral\nBD's operations are global and are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws), export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, privacy and other areas.\nBD’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of BD’s medical products. The scope of the activities of these agencies, particularly in the Europe, Japan, Latin America, and Asia Pacific regions in which BD operates, has been increasing.\n6\nIn order to market or sell most of its products, BD must secure authorization from the FDA and counterpart foreign regulatory agencies. After a device has received 510(k) clearance, premarket (PMA) approval or other marketing authorization for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change or changes in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new marketing authorization. The determination as to whether or not a modification or series of modifications could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer to assess using available guidance; however, regulators may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until a new marketing authorization is obtained.\nBD actively maintains Quality Systems that establish standards for its product design, manufacturing, and distribution processes, in accordance with ISO standards and FDA regulation. These agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of BD’s quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in agency policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new and existing products. Where possible, BD anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes. These agencies have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against BD, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions, for violations of applicable requirements. BD also undertakes voluntary compliance actions, such as voluntary recalls.  In some cases, BD may determine that an identified product issue does not require a voluntary recall action. Should a regulator disagree with such a determination, the regulator may require BD to cease marketing of and recall the device until the issue has been corrected. In addition, BD may be required to seek an additional marketing authorization prior to marketing the corrected device.\nBD also is subject to various federal and state laws, and laws outside the United States, concerning healthcare fraud and abuse (including false claims laws and anti-kickback laws), global anti-corruption, transportation, safety and health, and customs and exports. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years. This is part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the United States.\nIn addition, the federal government has enacted the Sunshine Act provisions requiring BD to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Countries outside the United States have enacted similar local laws requiring medical device companies to report transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed in those countries. Failure to comply with these laws could result in a range of fines, penalties and/or other sanctions.\nConsent Decree with FDA\nOur U.S. infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree originally entered into by Cardinal Health 303, Inc. with the FDA in 2007 related to its Alaris™ SE infusion pumps. In 2009, the decree was amended (the “Consent Decree”) to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for CareFusion 303, Inc., which was acquired by BD in 2015. CareFusion 303, Inc. remains the legal manufacturer of BD Alaris™ infusion pumps. The Consent Decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories.\nFollowing an inspection that began in March 2020 of our Medication Management Systems facility in San Diego, California (CareFusion 303, Inc.), the FDA issued a Form 483 Notice (the “2020 Form 483 Notice”) that contained a number of observations regarding the site’s compliance with FDA’s Quality System, reporting of corrections and removals, and Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulations. In December 2021, the FDA issued to CareFusion 303, Inc. a letter of non-compliance with respect to the Consent Decree (the “Non-Compliance Letter”) stating that, among other things, it had determined that certain of the corrective actions with respect to the 2020 Form 483 Notice appeared to be adequate, some were still in progress such that adequacy could not be determined yet, and certain others were not adequate (e.g., complaint handling and\n7\ncorrective and preventive actions, design verification and medical device reporting). Per the terms of the Non-Compliance Letter, CareFusion 303, Inc. provided the FDA with a proposed comprehensive corrective action plan (“CAP”) and has retained an independent expert to conduct periodic audits of the CareFusion 303, Inc. infusion pump facilities through 2025. CareFusion 303, Inc. has and will continue to update its CAP to address any observations that may arise during the course of these audits.\nIn addition, CareFusion 303, Inc. received an additional Form 483 Notice in May 2024 following an FDA inspection (“2024 Form 483 Notice”) that contained observations related to the site’s compliance with the FDA’s quality system regulations and MDR regulation related to its Infusion quality management system (covered by the Consent Decree) and separate Dispensing quality management system (which is not subject of the Consent Decree). On November 22, 2024, BD received a Warning Letter from the FDA, which is limited to CareFusion 303, Inc.’s Dispensing quality management system and BD Pyxis\nTM\nproducts (“Dispensing Warning Letter”). See “— FDA Warning Letters” below for further information.\nThe FDA’s review of our responses to the observations specific to the Infusion quality management system in the 2024 Form 483 Notice and the CAP is ongoing, and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of the observations, including but not limited to action pursuant to the Consent Decree, or that corrective actions proposed by CareFusion 303, Inc. will be adequate to address these observations. Additionally, we cannot currently predict the amount of additional monetary investment that will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business.\nThe Consent Decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps, recall products and take other actions. We may be required to pay damages of $15,000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the Consent Decree, up to $15 million per year.\nWe may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because, among other things, the FDA may determine that we are not fully compliant with the Consent Decree and Non-Compliance Letter and therefore impose penalties under the Consent Decree, and/or we may also be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the Consent Decree, including, but not limited to, additional fines, penalties, other monetary remedies, and expansion of the terms of the Consent Decree. As of September 30, 2024, we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the Consent Decree, and accordingly, we have no accruals associated with compliance with the Consent Decree.\nAs previously disclosed, on July 21, 2023, BD received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its updated BD Alaris™ Infusion System, which enables both remediation and a return to market for the BD Alaris™ Infusion System. This clearance covers updated hardware features for Point-of-Care Unit (PCU), large volume pumps, syringe pumps, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps, respiratory monitoring and auto-identification modules. It also covers a new BD Alaris™ Infusion System software version with enhanced cybersecurity, along with interoperability features that enable smart, connected care with electronic medical record systems. To address all open recalls and ensure all devices at customer sites are running the most recent version of the BD Alaris™ Infusion System Software, all of the current BD Alaris™ Infusion System devices in the U.S. market will be remediated or replaced with the updated 510(k) cleared version over the next several years.\nFDA Warning Letters\nOn January 11, 2018, BD received a Warning Letter from the FDA with respect to our former BD Preanalytical Systems (\"PAS\") unit, citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law. The Warning Letter states that, until BD resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, the FDA will not approve any premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the non-conformances are reasonably related or grant requests for certificates to foreign governments. BD has worked closely with the FDA and implemented corrective actions to address the quality management system concerns identified in the Warning Letter.  In March 2020, the FDA conducted a subsequent inspection of PAS, which it classified as\n8\nVoluntary Action Indicated, which means the FDA will not take or recommend any administrative or regulatory action as a result of the unit’s response to the observations associated with the quality management concerns in the inspection. BD continues to work with the FDA to generate additional clinical evidence and file 510(k)s as remaining commitments associated with the Warning Letter. As of September 30, 2024, BD has received seven FDA clearances.\nThe FDA review of these remaining commitments is ongoing, and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of these commitments, including but not limited to action pursuant to the Warning Letter.\nAs noted above, on November 22, 2024, BD received the Dispensing Warning Letter following an inspection of its facility located in San Diego, California, citing certain alleged violations of the quality system regulations, MDR regulation, the corrections and removals reporting regulation and law.\nThe Dispensing Warning Letter states that, until BD resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Dispensing Warning Letter, the FDA will not approve any premarket submissions for Class III devices and may not grant requests for certificates to foreign governments concerning devices to which the non-conformances are reasonably related. As requested by the Dispensing Warning Letter, BD is preparing a comprehensive response to address FDA’s feedback in the Dispensing Warning Letter, which may include implementing additional corrective actions; however, no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of the noted non-conformities, or that corrective actions proposed and taken by CareFusion 303, Inc. will be adequate to address the non-conformities. Any failure to adequately address the Dispensing Warning Letter may result in regulatory actions initiated by the FDA without further notice, which may include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction and civil monetary penalties.  As a result, the ultimate resolution of the Dispensing Warning Letter and its impact on the Company’s operations is unknown at this time.  In connection with the receipt of the Dispensing Warning Letter, the Company recorded an accrual in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024.  See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” It is possible that the amount of the Company’s liability could exceed its currently accrued amount.\nEthylene Oxide/Sterilization\nOn October 28, 2019, BD entered into a consent order with the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (the “EPD”), following the filing of a complaint and motion for temporary restraining order by the EPD seeking to enjoin BD from continuing sterilization operations at its Covington, Georgia facility.  Under the terms of the consent order,\nwhich has been amended two times upon mutual agreement of BD and EPD, BD voluntarily agreed to a nu\nmber of operational changes at its Covington and Madison, Georgia facilities, as well as at its distribution center in Covington, designed to further reduce ethylene oxide emissions, including but not limited to operating at a reduced capacity until successful implementation of fugitive emission control technology, ongoing ambient air monitoring and operational controls at such facilities. Following submission of data relating to the implementation of these operational changes, BD was permitted to return to normal operations in December 2021 at its facilities in Georgia in accordance with the operating conditions set forth in its permit applications, including a condition to continue ambient air monitoring. The final air permits for (i) the Covington and Madison facilities and (ii) the Covington distribution center were issued by the EPD on May 5, 2023, and July 2, 2024, respectively. By correspondence dated September 6, 2024, the EPD notified BD that the consent order had been terminated by the full and complete performance of each condition.\nAt a broader level, there is increased focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and state environmental regulatory agencies. Additional regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide may be imposed in the future, either domestically or outside the U.S. Ethylene oxide is the most frequently used sterilant for medical devices and healthcare products in the U.S., and in certain cases is the only option to sterilize critical medical device products for the safe administration to patients. Any such increased regulation could require BD or sterilization service providers, including providers used by BD, to temporarily suspend operations to install additional  emissions control technology, limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions, which would impact BD’s operations and further reduce the available capacity to sterilize medical devices and healthcare products, and could also result in additional costs. To this end, BD has proactively installed fugitive emissions controls at our\n9\nfacilities in East Columbus, NE and Sandy, UT. On April 5, 2024, the final National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”): Ethylene Oxide Emissions Standards for Sterilization Facilities regulation issued by the EPA became effective. Companies generally have two years from the effective date to comply with the new requirements of the NESHAP. We are in the process of implementing certain changes to our facilities in accordance with NESHAP’s requirements, and such measures will require additional implementation and ongoing operational costs, including investments in certain new technologies.\nIn addition, on April 13, 2023, the EPA published a Pesticide Registration Review; Proposed Interim Decision and Draft Risk Assessment Addendum for Ethylene Oxide (“PID”). The EPA has not yet finalized the PID, which regulates the use of ethylene oxide as a sterilant and is intended to mitigate any human health and environmental risks associated with its use. We cannot predict what the final PID adopted by the EPA may require and therefore we are not able to assess the impact on our sterilization facilities, on the third-party sterilization facilities that BD utilizes and on our operations more generally.\nIf any new or existing regulatory requirements or rulemaking result in the suspension, curtailment or interruption of sterilization operations at BD or at medical device sterilizers used by BD, or otherwise limit the availability of third-party sterilization capacity, this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products or lead to civil litigation or other claims against BD. BD has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any such disruptions, although these plans may not be able to fully offset such impact, for the reasons noted above.\nFor further discussion of risks relating to the regulations to which we are subject, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nHuman Capital Management\nAt BD, our associates are guided by our purpose of\nadvancing the world of health\nTM\nand The BD WAY, our cultural foundation that encompasses our core values, servant leadership expectations and the mindset we bring to our work. Our associates are empowered to contribute their unique ideas and experiences to fuel innovation and improve patient outcomes. As of September 30, 2024, BD is comprised of approximately 74,000 associates located in 61 countries. Attracting, developing and retaining talented people in all different functions is crucial to executing our strategy and our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive medical technology industry. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent depends on several factors, including compensation and benefits, talent development and career opportunities, and our unique culture. To that end, we continually invest in our associates to be an employer of choice.\nInclusion, Diversity & Equity\nFor BD, diversity refers to the practice of including the many communities and backgrounds that make up our Company and the world we serve. Diversity reflects our culture of inclusion, welcoming people of all different ethnicities, abilities, cultures, genders, religions, ages, sexual orientation, identity, experiences and tenure, as well as people with diverse opinions, perspectives, lifestyles, and ideas.  Our associates possess a broad range of beliefs and experiences which have helped BD achieve our leadership position in the medical technology industry and the global marketplace. A key component of our journey to continually build a better BD is our commitment to global inclusion, diversity and equity (“ID&E”). We believe this commitment, coupled with our purpose and culture, allows us to better understand patient and customer needs and develop innovative technologies to meet those needs.\nEach year, we establish annual corporate ID&E goals focused on fostering an inclusive workplace — fair treatment, equal access and opportunity, and acceptance for everyone. In addition, our executive leaders serve as sponsors to our nine global Associate Resource Groups (“ARGs”) that enable all associates to contribute their talents and skills to help advance opportunity for everyone. Our ARGs are empowered to set strategic goals aligned with their mission and centered around efforts to advance our company, local communities and each BD associates’ career, while fostering a sense of belonging, allyship, and professional development opportunities.\n10\nExternally, we are building on our existing momentum and remain involved in efforts to help the medical technology industry in supporting ID&E by improving health equity and expanding access, including by partnering with the Advanced Medical Technology Association (“AdvaMed”). We remain committed to sustaining meaningful, long-term strategic partnerships and programs to help address equitable access to care and advance the health of our communities around the world. This work impacts under-resourced communities, both in developed and underdeveloped countries.  Through the recently launched BD Community Investment Fund, we are investing over $2 million across more than 25 communities in FY2025, where BD has a significant footprint and share of the employment market. Grant recipients are community-based nonprofits with missions that are strategically aligned to BD’s health equity strategy and are working to address equal access to healthcare and social determinants of health in their communities.\nBD also has a longstanding history of associate volunteerism that is enabled through our public-private partnerships and collaborations with non-government organizations. We sponsor volunteer service trips and other meaningful volunteer opportunities to help strengthen health systems and enable an environment that can maintain critical competencies and resources needed to improve delivery of care. Associates are empowered to serve organizations and causes that are important to them in their local communities. This includes a matching gift program, paid time off to volunteer, and an award program to give grants to non-profit organizations in honor of associates who engage in exceptional volunteer efforts.\nThese collective efforts have garnered recognitions including being named among Fortune’s most innovative companies and by TIME as one of the world’s best companies. BD received the Business Group on Health \"Best Employers: Excellence in Health & Well-being Award\" for its commitment to advancing employee well-being, and was recognized as a best place to work for disability inclusion for the sixth consecutive year. In addition, the company was named among America’s Climate Leaders by USA TODAY; the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL, ranking second in the healthcare equipment and services industry for the second consecutive year. We remain committed and accountable to the work required within our company and beyond our corporate walls to build and maintain equity, acceptance, and accessibility for everyone.\nFor the above table, we define “executives” as associates in positions of vice president and above. “Management” positions are defined as those in manager, director or equivalent roles. Ratios are determined by dividing the number of diverse associates by the total number of associates including associates who have not disclosed race and/or gender. Year-over-year change is a percentage point.\nAssociate Growth and Development\nAt BD we hold ourselves and each other accountable for learning and growing every day, which underscores our growth mindset culture. Our commitment to continuous improvement helps us become the best version of ourselves and we invest significant resources to develop talent with the right capabilities to deliver the growth and innovation needed to support our strategy and customers, both for today and for the future. Our enhanced Strategic Organizational Planning process is focused on building the organizational capabilities required in the years to come, and we offer associates and managers a robust offering of tools to help in their personal and professional development, including career development plans, mentoring programs, and in-house learning opportunities, including BD University, our in-house continuing education curriculum delivered through a \"leaders-as-teachers\" approach. We remain committed to investing in our next generation of leaders, including by offering our associates a number of leadership development programs, designed to enable our BD\n11\nculture, cultivate leadership, and develop key organizational skills. We take an inclusive approach to delivering such programs, providing content in various formats that include digital, virtual, and in person. Through these learning opportunities, we aim to help our associates learn when and how they like. Our robust manager curriculum is designed to help our more than 8,000 people managers become more effective servant leaders who are equipped with resources to create work environments that facilitate growth and success. We have also applied our growth mindset philosophy to our performance management approach with an increased focus on continuous learning and development to help us all achieve our best.\nAssociate Engagement\nAs we strive to be an employer of choice, we believe it is critical that our associates are informed, engaged, and can provide feedback. We communicate frequently and transparently with our associates through a variety of communication methods, including video and written communications, town hall meetings, associate surveys, and our company intranet, and acknowledge individual contributions to BD through a number of rewards and recognition award programs.\nOur efforts to seek ongoing feedback help us better understand what we are doing well and how we can improve the associate experience. In addition to encouraging a speak-up culture between associates, their managers, and cross-functional teams, we conduct employee engagement surveys to provide all associates with an opportunity to share their perspectives and we take appropriate action in response.\nIn addition to helping associates stay engaged, we also work to foster and reinforce an inclusive culture where diverse perspectives are valued. This year, our ARGs continued to host company-wide dialogues and panel sessions to advance our business and cultural priorities and engage and foster conversations and awareness among associates.\nCompensation, Benefits and Well-being\nOur total rewards program is designed to attract and retain top talent and to incentivize performance aligned with our business strategy and values. We offer a comprehensive total rewards program aimed at promoting overall well-being in support of the varying health, home-life, and financial needs of our diverse and global associates. Through our integrated global approach to well-being, we provide support, education, and resources to empower associates across all geographies to prioritize their well-being and build resilience in the physical, emotional, financial, and social areas of life. To enable associates to take action in support of their overall well-being, our total rewards packages (which vary by location) include market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, healthcare benefits and retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, flexible work schedules, on-site health and fitness centers, free physicals and flu vaccinations, well-being education and resources, employee assistance programs and other mental health support and resources. Each year we review and implement program enhancements and investments to ensure our benefits are inclusive and representative of the needs of BD associates and their families. Additionally, over the last several years in the U.S., we have increased efforts to mitigate the impact of rising healthcare costs and to offer more cost effective benefit options, with a specific focus on affordability for BD associates earning $55,000 per year or less.\nBD is also committed to compensating all associates fairly and equitably for their contributions to company performance. Aligned with our priority focus on pay equity, we regularly conduct comprehensive audits, internal and external analyses, salary benchmarking and bias assessments to identify and remedy unexplained disparities.\n12\nAvailable Information\nBD maintains a website at www.bd.com.

    "text": "An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. The following describes some of the material risks that could adversely affect BD’s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.  We may also be adversely impacted by other risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial.\nBusiness, Economic and Industry Risks\nGlobal economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, could continue to adversely affect our operations.\nGeneral global economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital market volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, economic slowdown or recession, have contributed to conditions that have impacted, and may continue to impact, demand for our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our products, disrupt aspects of our supply chain, impair our ability to produce our products, increase borrowing costs and exacerbate other risks that affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, general economic conditions may impact the healthcare industry, including reductions in capital spending, changes in the delivery of healthcare services and increasing labor disputes or shortages, which could in turn affect demand for our products and services. Both domestic and international markets experienced inflationary pressures in fiscal year 2024 and we expect inflation to persist in the future but at lower levels than in recent years. In addition, currency exchange rates have been especially volatile in the recent past, and these currency fluctuations have affected, and may continue to affect, the reported value of our\n13\nassets and liabilities, as well as our cash flows.\nWe have also experienced, and may continue to experience, challenges in our global supply chain, including shortages in supply, or disruptions in production and shipments, of certain materials or components used in our products, and related price increases.\nWhile to date, we have been able to manage the challenges associated with these delays and shortages without significant disruption to our business, no assurance can be given that these efforts will continue to be successful.\nOur international operations subject us to certain business risks.\nA substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the U.S., and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets, especially in emerging markets. Our foreign operations subject us to certain commercial, political and financial risks. In addition to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange (discussed above), our business in these foreign markets is subject to changing political, social, and geopolitical conditions, such as the evolving situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia. These conditions include instability resulting from war, terrorism, insurrections and civil unrest, political conflict, and changing economic conditions, such as inflation, deflation, interest rate volatility and credit availability. Additionally, a number of factors, including U.S. relations with or among the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate, changes to international trade agreements and treaties, changes in tax laws and regulations, economic sanctions, export controls, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders, tariffs and other increases in trade protectionism and barriers to market participation, or the weakening or loss of certain intellectual property rights in some countries, may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Foreign regulatory requirements, including those related to the testing, authorization, and labeling of products and import or export licensing requirements, could affect the availability of our products in these markets. In addition to these broader market conditions, our operations may also be impacted by a variety of local factors, such as competition from local companies, local product preferences and requirements, changes in local healthcare payment systems and healthcare delivery systems, changes resulting from new political administrations, and labor force instability.\nThe success of our operations outside the U.S. also depends, in part, on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to, among other things, our production facilities and sales and distribution networks and manage and staff widespread international operations.  These and other factors may adversely impact our ability to pursue our growth strategy in these markets.\nIn addition, our international operations are governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more enforcement proceedings by U.S. and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties. While we have implemented policies and procedures relating to compliance with these laws, our international operations, which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments, create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors. We are also subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that restrict BD from transacting business with, or making investments in, certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. or foreign economic sanctions or export restrictions. Any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations and significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, and negatively affect our reputation and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe medical technology industry is very competitive.\nWe are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of existing competitors and new market entrants.  These include large medical device companies with multiple product lines, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do, as well as firms which are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines. Nontraditional entrants, such as technology companies, are also entering into the healthcare industry and some may have greater financial and other\n14\nresources than we do. We face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features, clinical or economic outcomes, product quality, availability, price, services and other factors.\nOur ability to compete is also impacted by changing customer and patient preferences and requirements, including increased focus on products using materials of concern and demand for more sustainable products, and for products incorporating digital capabilities, including artificial intelligence, as well as changes in the ways healthcare services are delivered, such as the transition of more care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management. In particular, the shift of care from acute to non-acute settings may also place financial pressure on hospitals and broader healthcare systems that could result in less demand for our products and services.  Cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs, improve clinical results and expand patient access. In addition, changes in regulatory or market standards, including, without limitation, cybersecurity requirements, often require significant investment to maintain compliance to relevant standards.  Our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we meet these changing market and regulatory demands in terms of our product offerings and go-to-market approaches.\nThe medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change, discovery and frequent product introductions. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies that provide better features, pricing, clinical outcomes or economic value may render our current products or subsequently developed products obsolete or less competitive. In some instances, competitors, including pharmaceutical companies, also offer (or are attempting to develop) alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device. Lower cost producers have also created pricing pressure, particularly in developing markets.\nThe medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than BD. Traditional distributors are also manufacturers of medical devices, providing another source of competition. In addition, healthcare systems and other providers are consolidating, resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies. As a result, competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased. Group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers. Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of our products.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.\nA substantial amount of our revenue is derived from international operations, and we anticipate that a significant portion of our future sales will continue to come from outside the U.S.  The revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the U.S. have been and may continue to be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which are caused by a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies and inflationary conditions.  Furthermore, currency exchange rates have been especially volatile in the recent past, and these currency fluctuations have affected, and may continue to affect, the reported value of our assets and liabilities, as well as our cash flows. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any exchange rate hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can effectively mitigate these risks.\n15\nMarket dynamics, changes in reimbursement practices and coverage policies and third-party payer cost containment measures could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold.\nThe sale of our products and services, as well as access to them, depends, in part, on the healthcare funding landscape and how healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by public and private payers. Coverage policies and reimbursement levels can vary across the payer community globally, regionally, and locally, and may affect which products customers purchase, the market acceptance rate for new technologies and the prices customers are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. In addition, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the reimbursement models and prices charged for medical products and services. Any changes to the reimbursement landscape, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products, which could adversely affect customer demand, or the price customers are willing to pay for such products. See “Third-Party Reimbursement” under “Item 1. Business.”\nA global trend towards limiting growth of healthcare costs may also put industry-wide pressure on medical device or clinical diagnostic pricing. In the U.S., these include value-based purchasing and managed care arrangements. Governments in China and other countries continue to use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders, price regulation (such as volume-based procurement programs (“VoBP”)), government imposed payback provisions, and changes in reimbursement practices and policies on average selling prices for our products, which have unfavorably impacted our revenues and may continue to impact our results of operations in certain countries.\nOur future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products, and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed.\nA significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development. New product development requires significant investment in R&D, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products and technologies, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the U.S. and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property rights, and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products. In addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development, or that we may seek to develop in the future, will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to develop and launch new products, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be negatively impacted. Even if we successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of impacts from any such events are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. Such events could result in preventative or protective measures or other actions by governments and private health institutions that could negatively impact local or global economic conditions and result in reductions in the demand for certain of our products, negatively impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, public health crises could result in significant volatility in our global supply chain network, including shortages in supply or disruptions or delays in shipments, as well as price increases, of certain materials or components used in our products and increases in transportation costs.\n16\nThe scope and duration of any future public health crisis, the pace at which government restrictions are imposed and lifted, the scope of additional actions taken to mitigate the spread of disease, global vaccination and booster rates, the speed and extent to which global markets and utilization rates for our products fully recover from the disruptions caused by such a public health crisis, and the impact of these factors on our business, financial condition and results of operations, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nTo the extent any such public health crises affect our operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nReductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business.\nWe sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories and private foundations. Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. A number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and similar agencies in other countries. The level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable. The availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forgo purchases of our products.\nWe need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives, key employees and other associates. Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons with certain technical competencies in some geographies, can be a challenge. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical, manufacturing and distribution experience to operate our business successfully. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including how BD’s compensation, benefits, work location, corporate culture and work environment compares with those offered by our competitors and other local employers. While there has been a slight improvement in what had been an intensely competitive labor market, there continues to be pressure on skilled labor in certain markets. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base has led to, and may continue to lead to, increased costs, such as an increase in overtime necessary to meet demand and increased wages and benefit costs to attract and retain skilled employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and skilled employees, we could encounter operational disruptions or other negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nCybersecurity incidents and breaches or breakdowns of our information and technology systems or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe rely on a large number of information and technology (“IT”) systems and related infrastructure, including services provided to us by third-party vendors to operate our business. We collect, use, store, transfer and otherwise process electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including personal, confidential, or proprietary information of BD and its customers, vendors and other business partners, and patients. Some of our products and systems collect personal, confidential or proprietary information regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some of our products are internet enabled or connect to our IT systems for maintenance and other purposes. We also have products and systems that connect to the internet, hospital networks, electronic medical record systems or electronic health record systems. In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, cloud and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions, platform-as-a-service (“PaaS”) solutions, data hosting and processing facilities, artificial intelligence, tools and other hardware, software (including open-source software) and technical applications and platforms, including some\n17\nthat are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-party vendors, to operate our business. Further, we expect that the breadth and complexity of our IT systems and infrastructure will increase as we expand our product offerings to utilize cloud technologies and potentially artificial intelligence, which present inherent enterprise technology risks, including those related to privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, that need to be managed. The foregoing could expose us to further risk of potential breaches, failures, interruptions and disruptions.\nWhile we are continuing to modernize our IT systems and infrastructure (such as hardware, software and operating systems), there are still technologies in operation that are more vulnerable to risk of failures, interruptions and disruptions. In addition, while we continue to enhance business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies, there is no guarantee that such plans and strategies will be effective or account for all eventualities. We have experienced, and could in the future experience, the failure, interruption or disruption of the functionality of our IT systems and infrastructure, or those of third-party vendors upon which we rely, which could impair our ability or that of our customers, suppliers and other business partners to conduct business, result in the loss of BD trade secrets or otherwise compromise personal, confidential or proprietary information of BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of patients, result in efficacy or safety concerns for certain of our products, result in reputational harm to our business and result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation.\nCyberattacks continue to increase in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are increasingly difficult to detect for periods of time, especially as they relate to attacks on third-party vendors. Such attacks are often carried out by motivated and highly skilled actors, who are increasingly well-resourced. Our IT systems and infrastructure, as well as those of various third parties on which we rely, have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, a variety of cyberattacks, including, but not limited to, unauthorized access, malicious code execution and/or phishing attacks, which has resulted, and could in the future result, in our and our customers’ personal, confidential or proprietary information being accessed, destroyed, lost, stolen or otherwise compromised and increased costs for cybersecurity measures or remediation. For example, through our cybersecurity monitoring tools and processes, we recently identified incidents of unauthorized activity on a portion of our IT systems, in which certain information relating to BD’s IT infrastructure and service credentials for certain BD Diagnostics Solutions, BD Pyxis\nTM\n, and Parata products utilized by laboratories, hospitals and pharmacies (the “Product Service Credentials”) were accessed and/or exfiltrated. After becoming aware of the incidents, BD terminated the unauthorized access, applied additional security measures, and is working with customers to update these Product Service Credentials. While an unauthorized party would have to penetrate a customer’s local network and, in some cases, may also need to be physically present at the instrument in order to use these Product Service Credentials, until these credentials are updated, there is a risk of unauthorized access that may impact the confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of the relevant products and associated systems or data. To date, we have not been made aware of any unauthorized use of these Product Service Credentials. As of the date of this filing, the incidents have not had, and we do not expect them to have, a material impact on BD’s overall business operations, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, certain factors, such as growth through acquisitions, rapid technology evolution, including increased adoption of artificial intelligence, and geopolitical events, have increased cybersecurity risks. In this increasingly hostile environment, we, and our third-party vendors could experience, a loss, unauthorized access to or disclosure or other compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information, including information regarding third parties, such as customers and patients, due to a number of causes, including, but not limited to, the exploitation of system vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, unauthorized access to our products, improper data handling, breakdowns of our IT systems and infrastructure or other cybersecurity incidents or breaches. These cybersecurity incidents and breaches could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position in the market and result in other significant negative consequences, including lost revenue, manufacturing challenges or disruption, diversion of management attention, litigation, regulatory action and damage to our relationships with vendors, business partners and customers.\n18\nUnauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products, including through cyberattacks, may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions, as well as impact our compliance with privacy, data protection and other laws and regulations and could result in reputational damage and actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation.\nIn addition, acquisitions, and the integration of acquired companies into the Company’s existing and future IT systems and infrastructure, including with third-party vendors and processes, inherently presents cybersecurity risks, such as exposing us to vulnerabilities and threats that were previously unknown or unmanaged. While we attempt to mitigate these risks through due diligence, risk assessments and the implementation of cybersecurity controls and protocols during and after the acquisition process, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent, mitigate or remediate cybersecurity incidents or breaches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we have made investments intended to address threats presented by cybersecurity incidents and breaches, continue to dedicate significant resources intended to protect our products and systems from cybersecurity incidents and breaches, and continue to work with government authorities and third-party vendors to detect and reduce the risk of future cybersecurity incidents and breaches, there can be no assurances that these protective measures will be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity incidents or breaches that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nCost volatility could adversely affect our operations\n.\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials, components, labor, freight, energy and other production costs that, in turn, increases the costs of producing and distributing our products. New laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy, conversion and transportation costs, as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components. In particular, we purchase supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used to manufacture certain products, and any significant increase in resin costs, whether due to inflationary pressure, supply constraints, regulatory changes or otherwise\n,\ncould adversely impact future operating results. Increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs. The costs of raw materials, transportation, construction, services, and energy necessary for the production and distribution of our products continues to increase and be volatile. These prices may continue to fluctuate based on many factors beyond our control. While we have implemented cost containment measures, progressed selective price increases and taken other actions to mitigate these inflationary pressures in our supply chain, we may not be able to completely offset all the increases in our operational costs.\nA reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products, some of which are not available from multiple sources. In addition, for quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and other reasons, certain raw materials and components are purchased from sole suppliers. The price and supply of these materials and components has been, and may in the future be, impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control, including supplier shutdowns, supplier capacity constraints, supplier insolvencies, labor disruptions or shortages, transportation delays, inflationary pricing pressures, work stoppages, extreme weather events, geopolitical developments, global economic uncertainty or downturns, sanctions and trade restrictions, and other governmental regulatory actions (such as in the area of materials of concern) and any such changes or disruptions could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant challenges to our global transportation channels and other aspects of our global supply chain network, including to the cost and availability of energy, raw materials and components due to shortages, labor strikes, and cost inflation. We continuously explore\n19\nalternative routes, transportation modes, and replenishment timings to preempt and mitigate associated risks, but no assurance can be given that these efforts will adequately address these challenges and disruptions.\nWhile we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply and service, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful. In addition, due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruption of our manufacturing or sterilization operations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have manufacturing sites all over the world. In some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or a few of our plants. Interruption to our manufacturing operations resulting from system outages, cybersecurity incidents or breaches, weather or natural disasters, regulatory requirements, labor disruptions, equipment failure or other issues in our manufacturing process, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. In some instances, we may not be able to transition manufacturing to other BD sites or a third party to replace the lost production. A significant interruption of our manufacturing operations could result in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers.\nIn addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale, and we utilize both BD facilities and third parties for this process. In some instances, only a few facilities are qualified under applicable regulations to conduct this sterilization. To the extent we or our third-party providers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to lack of capacity, availability of materials for sterilization (including cobalt), regulatory requirements or otherwise, we may be unable to transition sterilization to other sites or modalities in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nAt a broader level, there is increased focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide by the EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies. Additional regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide for sterilization may be imposed in the future, both domestically and outside the U.S. On April 5, 2024, the final National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”): Ethylene Oxide Emissions Standards for Sterilization Facilities regulation issued by the EPA became effective. Companies generally have two years from the effective date to comply with the new requirements of the NESHAP. We are in the process of implementing certain changes to our facilities in accordance with NESHAP’s requirements, and such measures will require additional implementation and ongoing operational costs, including investments in certain new technologies.\nIn addition, on April 13, 2023, the EPA published a Pesticide Registration Review: Proposed Interim Decision and Draft Risk Assessment Addendum for Ethylene Oxide (“PID”). The EPA has not yet finalized the PID, which regulates the use of ethylene oxide as a sterilant and is intended to mitigate any human health and environmental risks associated with its use. We cannot predict what the final PID adopted by the EPA may require and therefore we are not able to assess the impact on our sterilization facilities, on the third-party sterilization facilities that BD utilizes and our operations more generally.\nThis increased regulation could require BD or sterilization service providers, including providers used by BD, to temporarily suspend operations to install additional emissions control technology, limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions, which would impact BD’s operations and further reduce the available capacity to sterilize medical devices and healthcare products, and could also result in additional costs. If any existing regulatory requirements or any such regulatory actions or rulemaking result in the suspension or interruption of sterilization operations at BD or at medical device sterilizers used by BD, or otherwise limit the availability of third-party sterilization capacity, this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products or lead to civil litigation or other claims against BD. BD has business continuity plans in\n20\nplace to mitigate the impact of any such disruption, although these plans may not be able to fully offset such impact, for the reasons noted above. See “Item 1. Business - Regulation” for a discussion of the consent order BD entered into with the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the risk related to sterilization operations generally.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”) in the atmosphere may present risks to our business and operations. Extreme weather or other conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, wildfires or flooding, which may result from climate change could adversely impact our operations and supply chain, including the availability and cost of raw materials and components required for the operation of our business, and human capital issues for BD and companies within our supply chain. In addition, access to and pricing of certain natural resources, such as water, could impact our manufacturing operations. Such conditions could also result in physical damage to our products, plants and distribution centers, as well as the infrastructure and facilities of our suppliers and of hospitals, medical care facilities and other customers.\nThere has been increased focus by federal, international, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies to combat and/or limit the effects of climate change through a variety of means, including regulating GHG emissions (and requirements to disclose climate-related risks and metrics, including GHG emissions), policies mandating or promoting the use of renewable or zero-carbon energy and sustainability initiatives, and additional taxes on fuel and energy. There has been, and in the future there may be additional, legislation or regulations enacted or promulgated in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we do business that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements on our operations than our historical legal or regulatory obligations as well as additional disclosure or reporting requirements. We have experienced, and companies in our supply chain may experience, increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations. Such increased compliance burdens and costs could cause disruption in the sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, the impacts of climate change may further influence customer and other stakeholder preferences and requirements. This includes increased demand for more sustainable products, including products with lower environmental footprints, and for companies to produce and demonstrate progress against sustainability goals and GHG reduction targets, including product-level GHG emissions data. Failure to meet stakeholder expectations or our own goals or commitments relating to sustainability or GHG emissions reductions, provide sustainable products or demonstrate GHG reductions could potentially result in loss of market share, reputational impacts, or an inability to attract and retain customers.\nLegal, Quality and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to lawsuits.\nWe are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits, including, among others, purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and violations of federal securities laws, environmental and product liability claims (including pending claims relating to ethylene oxide, our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women, vena cava filter products and implantable ports, which involve, or could in the future involve, lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation or other consolidated proceedings) and suits alleging patent infringement. We also are or have been subject to government investigations and civil investigative demands seeking information with respect to alleged violations of law, including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid), the federal securities laws, federal contracting requirements and/or sales and marketing practices, among other things. A more detailed description of certain litigation to which we are a party is contained in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We could be subject to additional lawsuits, governmental investigations, subpoenas and civil investigative demands in the future. Any such lawsuits, governmental investigations, subpoenas and\n21\ncivil investigative demands could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could distract management from the operations of the business.\nReserves established for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability, but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established to the extent future losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and our underlying loss reserve estimates, additional reserves may be established or current reserves may be significantly increased from time-to-time. Also, in some instances, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges materially in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance.  In addition, even if the Company believes it has meritorious defenses, from time to time the Company engages in settlement discussions and mediation and considers settlements taking into account various factors including, among other things, developments in such legal proceedings and the resulting risks and uncertainties. These activities have resulted in settlements for certain matters and going forward could result in further settlements, any of which may be confidential and could be significant and result in charges in excess of accruals. Any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nWith respect to certain litigation, we believe that some settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, may be covered in whole or in part under applicable insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies, or, in some circumstances, indemnification obligations owed to us by other parties. However, amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available. Also, for certain product liability claims or lawsuits, BD does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation.\nOur operations are global and are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws), export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, labor, privacy and data protection, taxation, artificial intelligence and other areas. Violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and, in some cases, exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to climate change and the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate closures of, or changes to, our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD. The enactment of additional laws and reporting requirements in the future or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations and financial performance. For example, the FDA’s increased oversight of laboratory developed tests may impact certain of our customers and, as a result, could affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Most of our products must receive authorization from the FDA or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold. This process may require us to incur significant costs in terms of time and resources, and these costs have been increasing due to increased requirements from the FDA and comparable governing bodies for supporting data for submissions. The regulatory process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of our products. Governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration, including, but not limited to, labeling updates or changes to prohibited materials that require us to modify or re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability\n22\nto market our products in those countries. In addition, changes we have made, or may make in the future, to our products have been, or may in the future be, subject to U.S. or foreign regulatory review, including additional 510(k) clearance, PMA approval and other marketing authorizations (such as, but not limited to, with respect to BD Alaris\nTM\npumps and related sets and BD Vacutainer\nTM\n). We have made modifications to certain of our products in the past and have determined based on our review of our internal documentation and data and the applicable FDA or foreign regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new clearance or approval. If the FDA or a foreign regulator disagrees with our determinations, we may be required to cease marketing and/or to recall the modified product until we obtain a new marketing authorization, which could result in lost revenue, additional costs and damage to our reputation. Such non-compliance may also subject the Company to civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, or other actions being taken with respect to products in the field. Marketing authorization and the time needed to secure such authorization is uncertain and we may not be able to obtain such authorization on the timeline or conditions we expect or at all. Our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals from the FDA or foreign regulators may be difficult and could increase the cost of compliance and impact our ability to market our products.\nFollowing the introduction of a product, these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance. Our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting and other post market requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production, marketing or sale of our products and result in delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, warning letters or consent decrees, closure of manufacturing sites, import bans, seizures or recalls of products, civil or criminal sanctions and damage to our reputation. More stringent oversight by the FDA and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity, which increases our compliance risk.\nOur CareFusion 303, Inc. subsidiary is operating under a Consent Decree that affects our BD Alaris™ infusion pump business in the U.S. We are also currently operating under two warning letters issued by the FDA for our Dispensing and Specimen Management businesses. For more information regarding the consent decree and warning letters, see “Regulation” under Item 1. Business.\nAs previously disclosed, on July 21, 2023, BD received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its updated BD Alaris™ Infusion System, which enables both remediation and a return to market for the BD Alaris™ Infusion System. In accordance with our commitments to the FDA, all of the current BD Alaris™ Infusion System devices in the U.S. market will be remediated or replaced with the updated 510(k) cleared version over the next several years.\nThe overall timing and cost of replacement or remediation of the BD Alaris™ Infusion Systems and return to market in the U.S. may be impacted by, among other things, customer readiness, supply continuity, and our continued engagement with the FDA.\nIn addition, the European Union (“EU”) has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the “EU MDR”) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evidence requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. The EU MDR has been fully operational for previously approved self-certified medical devices since May 2021. The application of the EU MDR has been extended until 2027 for certain devices considered higher-risk and to 2028 for other devices. This longer transition timeline applies only to devices that are transitioning to MDR and meet other specific conditions set out in the EU IVDR. The EU IVDR has been fully applicable for manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices since May 2022. Complying with and maintaining devices under these regulations requires us to incur significant expenditures. Additionally, the availability of EU notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited, which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the EU MDR. Any such delays, or any failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to EU conformity requirements.\n23\nWe are also subject to complex and frequently changing privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and a significant number of other countries where BD operates, regarding the collection, use, storage, security, transfer and other processing of personal data. These laws, rules and regulations require companies to, among other things, proactively implement effective programs and enhance internal policies, business practices, processes, and controls and could impose significant limitations and additional compliance costs on us. In addition, these laws, rules and regulations require us to embed privacy, security and data protection requirements in all assets impacting the processing of personal data and could also require us to modify current or future products or services, which may harm our future financial results. Any actual or perceived noncompliance with these laws, rules and regulations, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing the processing of personal data could result in significant consequences for BD, including, among other things, business interruption, sanctions and significant pecuniary fines, regulatory inquiries and investigations, adverse publicity, loss of competitive advantage and customer trust, as well as privacy litigation and civil lawsuits with damages.\nThe importance of privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations for the healthcare and med-tech industry specifically is constantly growing, as personal data is an integral part of doing business in our sector, and the legal standards are evolving and becoming more complex worldwide. A significant number of countries where we operate have enacted privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations, the majority of which have extraterritorial scope, creating significant compliance challenges as we seek to maintain our global reach, with significant penalties for non-compliance, based on total worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year. In some cases, there are restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside the home country. More recently, privacy and data protection regulators are paying special attention to emerging issues linked to new digital technologies, such as the use of artificial intelligence, biometrics, and surveillance technologies, which pose unique challenges to existing privacy and data protection paradigms.\nIn addition, certain privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations may apply to us indirectly through our customers, manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party partners. For example, non-compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations by a third-party partner that is processing personal data on our behalf may be deemed non-compliant by us or a failure by us to conduct proper due diligence on the third party, which could result in material fines or litigation. We also could be subject to additional expenses and liabilities in the event of a cybersecurity incident or breach, or the failure of an IT system owned or operated by us or a third party with which we partner or its vendor.\nFinally, changes in the tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our tax expense and/or tax payments, increase tax uncertainty and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules which impose a 15% minimum tax on income of large multinational enterprises in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pillar Two is effective in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate beginning in fiscal year 2025. We continue to evaluate the impacts of the enacted Pillar Two legislation. Tax laws, inclusive of Pillar Two legislation, in the U.S. and in other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nDefects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events. Such events have in the past and could in the future lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs, lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in\n24\nsignificant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements.\nOur operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets.\nMany of our businesses rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property assets. These intellectual property assets, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Any patent applications we own or license may not result in patents being issued and any issued patents we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Patents attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products expire, may also adversely affect our competitive position. Competitors may design around our intellectual property to develop competing technologies and products without infringing our intellectual property rights. In addition, competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property, which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees, damage awards and past or future royalties, as well as injunctions against future sales of our products. We also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties. These agreements may not adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.\nThe loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not be able to service all of our indebtedness.\nWe depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the Company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. There can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital, sell assets or refinance our indebtedness. Any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, we may not be able to refinance existing debt on favorable or comparable terms.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on our property, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business. In addition, the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including financial ratios. Our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these\n25\ncovenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-off of Embecta Corp.\nOn April 1, 2022, we completed the spin-off of Embecta Corp. (Embecta) (NASDAQ: EMBC), which holds our former Diabetes Care business and is now one of the world’s largest pure-play diabetes management companies in the world. The spin-off is intended to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  If any facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from BD and Embecta regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the spin-off may not qualify for tax-free treatment, which could result in significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities for BD and its shareholders.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.\nWe seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky, and the integration of any newly-acquired business requires significant effort and management attention. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful.\nNatural disasters, war and other events beyond our control could disrupt our business and adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, wildfires, floods and other extreme weather events (including those caused by climate change), war, global health crises, terrorism, social or political unrest, labor disruptions and international conflicts and other events beyond our control, and actions taken by the U.S. and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events, could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the U.S. and areas outside of the U.S. in which we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers.\n26\nInformation About our Executive Officers\nThe following is a list of the executive officers of BD, their ages and all positions and offices held by each of them during the past five years. There is no family relationship between any executive officer or director of BD.\n27"

    "text": "Risk Management and Strategy\nBD’s cybersecurity risk management program is focused on maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of BD products, manufacturing and distribution operational technology (“OT”), enterprise IT and BD data. We incorporate cybersecurity risk management into our systems and processes, which we strive to align with multiple industry-leading cybersecurity standards, including the Joint Security Plan issued by the Health Sector Coordinating Council for BD products and guidelines issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for our manufacturing and distribution OT and enterprise IT.\nOur commitment to cybersecurity includes a total life cycle approach to protecting BD products, manufacturing and distribution OT, enterprise IT and BD data. Using various tools and techniques, we proactively monitor for suspicious activity and perform risk assessments (including independent third-party risk assessments), penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. We also collaborate with government and industry leaders to gather and share cybersecurity threat intelligence. We provide mandatory annual cybersecurity awareness training for our 70,000+ associates, and we send phishing simulation emails monthly to all associates who use a BD email address and an assigned computing device. We also use tools to monitor unintentional sharing of personal, confidential and proprietary information. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a documented incident response and critical incident management plan to identify, assess and manage the potential impact of cybersecurity threats or vulnerabilities and prioritize risk mitigation and/or remediation measures to safeguard BD products, manufacturing and distribution OT, enterprise IT and BD data.\nWe strive to align BD Information Security policies and procedures with industry best practices, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27001:2022 standards for information security, Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”) 2900-1 Cybersecurity Standard for Medical Devices, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s pre-market and post-market guidance for cybersecurity in medical devices. In 2022, BD achieved ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification at the enterprise level, demonstrating that BD’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) conforms to internationally recognized cybersecurity standards. In July 2024, BD engaged a third-party auditor to complete its second enterprise-level annual surveillance audit for ISO 27001, which determined that BD continues to meet these rigorous standards. These policies and procedures establish processes for handling data, assets, systems and other technology resources to help protect BD products, manufacturing and distribution OT, enterprise IT and BD data.\nWe also incorporate cybersecurity risk management into our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program. Through our ERM program, we identify, assess and manage a broad range of risks across our businesses, regions and functions, and we align our risk management efforts with our corporate strategy. Our enterprise IT, manufacturing and distribution OT, third-party and product cybersecurity risks are each assessed as part of our ERM program. As part of our cybersecurity risk management program, we engage a range of third-party experts each year, including advisors, consultants and auditors, to evaluate and enhance our program through security attestations and certifications, maturity assessments and security testing. We also engage third parties for staff augmentation to strengthen our cybersecurity program through additional dedicated resources. In addition, we actively engage with intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and advocacy and industry groups.\nWe also identify, assess and manage risks associated with our use of third-party service providers and maintain a third-party risk management program that monitors third-party cybersecurity risk throughout the procurement lifecycle—from planning and sourcing through relationship conclusion. This program includes supplier cybersecurity vetting at the time of engagement, cybersecurity risk assessments and cybersecurity vulnerability monitoring. Our third-party risk management program is aligned with NIST and ISO/IEC frameworks and is focused on continuous improvement through intelligence sharing with industry groups.\n28\nThere can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent, mitigate or remediate cybersecurity incidents or breaches. Although we have experienced cyberattacks as discussed in “Item 1A, Risk Factors” above, based on the information available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect BD. Despite our efforts in implementing and maintaining our cybersecurity risk management program, there can be no assurance that we, or the third parties with which we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident or breach in the future that may materially affect us. For further discussion of how our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by risks from cybersecurity threats, see “Item 1A, Risk Factors.”\nGovernance\nThe Board and its committees provide oversight of our ERM program, including our cybersecurity risk management program and the protection and resilience of BD products, manufacturing and distribution OT, enterprise IT and BD data. In addition, our management periodically conducts cybersecurity crisis simulations with the full Board to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks and enhance our incident preparedness. We also provide Board members the opportunity to take a cybersecurity training course through an external service provider. The Board delegates oversight of our cybersecurity risk management program to the Audit Committee and the Quality and Regulatory Committee (QRC). The Audit Committee regularly reviews our cybersecurity risk management program with respect to manufacturing and distribution OT and enterprise IT, and the QRC reviews our product cybersecurity program.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is led by our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), whose organization is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing risks from cybersecurity threats. Our CISO has over 20 years of experience leading information security, data risk management, application/system development and engineering teams at multiple large, global and publicly traded companies—including several Fortune 500 companies. Our CISO holds Certified Information Systems Security Professional (“CISSP”), Certified Information Security Manager (“CISM”), Certified Information Privacy Professional (“CIPP”) and Security+ certifications and contributes to healthcare industry working groups, most recently serving as chair of the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (the “HISAC”) Information Security Risk Management Working Group. Our CISO reports to our Chief Information Officer (CIO), who has overall responsibility for the cybersecurity risk management program and organization. Our CIO has more than 25 years of experience in information technology, business transformation, cybersecurity and technology solutions, including leadership roles at multiple large, global and publicly traded companies—including several Fortune 500 companies. Our Vice President, Research and Development, Product Security (“VP of Product Security”) also supports our cybersecurity risk management program by leading a team of product security professionals focused on implementing security by design, security in use and product end of life strategies across our portfolio of software-based products. Our VP of Product Security has more than 15 years of experience in the medical device industry, including at another publicly traded company managing product security. Our VP of Product Security has received training from the SANS Institute and contributes to healthcare industry groups such as the Health Sector Coordinating Counsel – Joint Cybersecurity Working Group.\nOur CISO is supported by and is a member of our Cybersecurity Strategy and Risk Committee (“CSRC”), which is a management-level governance body for oversight of all of our cybersecurity risk. Our VP of Product Security is also a member of the CSRC. On a quarterly basis, our CSRC receives information from our CISO regarding BD’s enterprise IT, manufacturing and distribution OT and product security programs, including the Company’s strategy and progress on key initiatives. We also have an executive-level Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) that oversees our ERM program and aims to create an enterprise-wide culture that promotes open discussion regarding risk and opportunities and integrates effective risk management into our goals and objectives. As part of integrating cybersecurity risk management into our ERM program, our ERC receives updates from our CIO and CISO on BD’s cybersecurity risk management strategy and program on a regular basis.\n29\nIn addition to our CSRC and our ERC, we have established processes providing for the escalation of certain cybersecurity incidents and breaches. We maintain a global response plan that sets forth a detailed incident management and reporting protocol designed to respond to cybersecurity incidents and breaches appropriately and efficiently. Our operational team is responsible for communicating the impact and status of certain cybersecurity incidents and breaches to senior management, including the CISO, based on its assessment of the significance of the cybersecurity incident or breach. We also have a committee consisting of senior members of our management, including our CIO and CISO, to evaluate cybersecurity incidents and breaches reported to the committee by our CISO on an ad-hoc basis for potential material impacts on BD, including its financial condition and results of operations, and assess BD’s public disclosure obligations. The CIO, CISO and other members of the committees are informed about the status, effectiveness and risks associated with our cybersecurity risk management program through their management of and participation in the cybersecurity risk management processes, policies and operations described above.\nOur CIO and CISO provide updates to the Audit Committee, and our VP of Product Security provides updates to the QRC, multiple times per year regarding BD’s cybersecurity risk management program, including the results of third-party assessments, progress towards cybersecurity goals and objectives, product cybersecurity matters, third-party risk management, regulatory compliance and other topics as needed. We also have processes by which certain cybersecurity incidents and breaches are escalated and reported to the Board of Directors or a Board committee, as appropriate, based on our management’s assessment of risk."

Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. References to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years, which end on September 30.\nCompany Overview\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nBecton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”) is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public. The Company's organizational structure is based upon three principal business segments, BD Medical (“Medical”), BD Life Sciences (“Life Sciences”) and BD Interventional (“Interventional”).\nBD’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. Our products are marketed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives. We organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, which include the following geographic regions: Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (collectively referred to below as “EMA”), as well as, Latin America and certain countries within Greater Asia.\nStrategic Objectives\nBD remains focused on delivering durable growth, creating shareholder value and making appropriate investments for the future. BD 2025, our vehicle for value creation, is anchored in three key pillars: grow, simplify and empower. BD's management team aligns our operating model and investments with these key strategic pillars through continuous focus on the following underlying objectives:\nGrow\n•\nAccelerating innovation in smart devices, robotics, analytics, and artificial intelligence in order to enable new care settings, improve outcomes, streamline care workflows, and reduce costs within healthcare settings;\n•\nFocusing on a strong portfolio of core leading products, solutions and services that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers;\n•\nInvesting in research and development that leads to and expands category leadership, as well as results in a robust product pipeline;\n•\nLeveraging our global scale in order to provide equitable access to affordable medical technologies around the world, including in under-resourced markets;\n•\nSupplementing our internal growth through strategic acquisitions in faster growing market segments; and\n•\nFocusing on cash management and an efficient capital structure in order to drive balance sheet productivity and strong shareholder returns.\nSimplify\n•\nDriving operating effectiveness and margin expansion through deployment of our BD Excellence program to increase factory productivity and asset efficiencies;\n33\n•\nReducing complexity, increasing agility and improving customer experience by rationalizing our product portfolio, as well as by simplifying and optimizing our architecture and operating model;\n•\nMaking strategic investments that prioritize a culture of quality and our quality management system to ensure we are a best-in-class, proactive quality-driven organization;\n•\nEnhancing customer experiences through the digitalization of internal processes and go-to-market approaches;\n•\nCollaborating across our supply chain to responsibly source materials and goods, as well as to reduce environmental impacts; and\n•\nContinuing our investments in an enterprise-wide renewable energy strategy to create more resilient operations.\nEmpower\n•\nFostering a purpose-driven culture with a focus on positive impact to all stakeholders–customers, patients, employees, shareholders and communities;\n•\nCultivating an inclusive work environment that welcomes and celebrates diverse backgrounds and perspectives;\n•\nGrowing and enabling talent through training, development and reskilling strategies; and\n•\nDriving sustainability initiatives within our organizational units to support enterprise-wide collaboration towards our sustainability strategy.\nIn assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as BD’s financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews forecast data, monthly actual results, including segment sales, and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expense, investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows.\nAcquisition of Edwards Lifesciences’ Critical Care Product Group\nOn September 3, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Edwards Lifesciences’ Critical Care product group (“Critical Care”), which we renamed as BD Advanced Patient Monitoring (“Advanced Patient Monitoring”), for total consideration of $3.911 billion. Advanced Patient Monitoring is a global leader in advanced monitoring solutions that expands BD’s portfolio of smart connected care solutions with its growing set of leading monitoring technologies, advanced AI-enabled clinical decision tools and robust innovation pipeline that complement our existing technologies serving operating rooms and intensive care units.\nBD reports the results associated with Advanced Patient Monitoring’s product offerings as a separate organizational unit within our Medical segment and additional disclosures relating to this acquisition are provided in Notes 8, 11 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nBD’s Spin-Off of Diabetes Care and Sale of Surgical Instrumentation Platform\nIn August 2023, we completed the sale of the Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform. The historical financial results for this platform have not been classified as a discontinued operation.\nIn April 2022, we completed the spin-off of our former Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company. The historical results of the Diabetes Care business that was contributed in the spin-off were reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.\nAdditional disclosures regarding the sale and spin-off are provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n34\nKey Trends Affecting Results of Operations\nOur operations, supply chain, suppliers and customers are exposed to various global macroeconomic factors and we continually evaluate macroeconomic conditions to assess their potential impact to our operations and financial results. Macroeconomic factors which affected our operations and impacted results in fiscal year 2024 included the following:\n•\nAs anticipated, market dynamics in China, such as volume-based procurement programs (“VoBP”) and the government’s focus to improve compliance of healthcare practitioners, had an adverse impact on our results of operations and these dynamics could continue to unfavorably impact our results of operations.\n•\nAs is further discussed below, our labor costs were generally higher in our fiscal year 2024 compared with the prior-year period.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, temporary shortages in supply of certain materials or components that are used in our products. The stable flow of global transport is critical to our operations and as such, events affecting the flow of logistics around the globe may adversely impact our supply chain and distribution channels. In general, major disruptions in the sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products could adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn addition, current healthcare delivery has transitioned more care from acute to non-acute settings and has increased focus on chronic disease management; this transition has placed additional financial pressure on hospitals and the broader healthcare system. Healthcare institutions may take actions to mitigate any persistent pressures on their budgets and such actions could impact the future demand for our products and services. Additionally, a deterioration of staffing levels within healthcare systems may affect the prioritization of healthcare services, which could also impact the demand for certain of our products. Also, reductions or delays in governmental research funding and/or higher interest rates could cause customers for our instruments and reagents to delay or forgo purchases of these products.\nCertain geopolitical conditions, including the evolving situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, may impact global macroeconomic conditions, including those discussed above. While these geopolitical conditions have not materially impacted our results of operations to date, the continuation and/or an escalation of these evolving situations may weaken the global economy and could result in additional inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints, including the unavailability and cost of energy.\nWe continue to invest in research and development, strategic tuck-in acquisitions, geographic expansion, and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including strategic geographical expansion), and develop innovative new products, as well as continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness.\nWe have been mitigating the impacts of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above through various strategies which leverage our procurement, logistics and manufacturing capabilities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively mitigate these pressures in future periods and an inability to offset these pressures through our strategies, at least in part, could adversely impact our results of operations. Due to the significant uncertainty that exists relative to the duration and overall impact of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above, our future operating performance, particularly in the short-term, may be subject to volatility. The impacts of macroeconomic and other conditions on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are dependent on certain factors, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n35\nSummary of Financial Results\nWorldwide revenues in 2024 of $20.178 billion increased 4.2% from the prior-year period. This increase reflected the following impacts:\n(a)    Volume/other includes revenues attributable to products, services and licensing.\n(b)    Represents the recognition of accruals resulting from recent developments relating to the Italian government medical device pay back legislation, as well as another legal matter, and which substantially relate to years prior to the current fiscal year. Additional disclosures regarding these legislative and legal matters are provided in Notes 6 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur financial position remains strong, with cash flows from continuing operating activities totaling $3.844 billion in 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had $2.301 billion in cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash. We continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and during fiscal year 2024, we paid cash dividends to common shareholders of $1.100 billion.\nEach reporting period, we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period. The fiscal year 2024 impact of foreign currency translation on our revenues is provided above and the impact on our earnings is provided further below. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Foreign currency-neutral (\"FXN\") information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a foreign currency-neutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate foreign currency-neutral percentages by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Results on a foreign currency-neutral basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nUpdates to Financial Results Reported in Earnings Release\nOn November 7, 2024, we furnished a Current Report on Form 8-K that included as an exhibit a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 (the “Earnings Release”). On November 22, 2024 and subsequent to furnishing the Earnings Release, we received the Dispensing Warning Letter, as more fully discussed under Item 1. Business— Regulation—FDA\n36\nWarning Letters. A charge of $28 million to recognize our currently estimated liability for future costs expected to be incurred to address the non-conformities identified in the Dispensing Warning Letter was recorded to\nCost of products sold\nfor the three-month period and fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data:\n44\nNet Interest Expense\nHigher interest expense in 2024 compared with 2023 primarily reflected higher overall interest rates on debt outstanding, as well as higher total debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023, which reflected debt issued in our third quarter of fiscal year 2024 to fund the cash consideration payable upon our acquisition of Advanced Patient Monitoring. Higher interest expense in 2023 compared with 2022 was largely attributable to the higher levels of commercial paper borrowings outstanding throughout 2023 and higher overall interest rates on debt outstanding.  Additional disclosures regarding our financing arrangements and debt instruments are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nHigher interest income in 2024 compared with 2023, and in 2023 compared with 2022, primarily reflected higher overall interest rates and levels of cash on hand during the current-year periods, compared with the prior-year periods.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax rates for continuing operations in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nThe effective income tax rate for continuing operations in 2024 compared with 2023 primarily reflected the impact of more favorable discrete items recorded in 2023. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily reflected the impact of a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities upon the approval of a tax incentive.\n45\nNet Income and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations\nNet income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nFinancial Instrument Market Risk\nWe selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk, primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations. The counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  Additional disclosures regarding our derivative instruments are provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nBD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. These payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts.  We have also hedged the currency exposure associated with investments in certain foreign subsidiaries with instruments such as foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps, which are designated as net investment hedges, as well as currency exchange contracts.  In order to mitigate transactional foreign currency exposures resulting from anticipated intercompany purchases and sales, we have hedged a portion of this currency risk with certain instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, including sales, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period.  We did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against these foreign currency impacts in fiscal year 2024 or 2023.\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. For foreign currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities.\nWith respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2023, the impact that changes in the U.S. dollar would have on pre-tax earnings was estimated as follows:\nThese calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments.\n46\nInterest Rate Risk\nWhen managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest rate derivative instruments, fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves. Market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities.\nThe impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2023, as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period, based upon our overall interest rate exposure, were estimated as follows:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur strong financial position and cash flow performance have provided us with the capacity to accelerate our innovation pipeline through investments in research and development, as well as through strategic acquisitions. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, our ability to generate operating cash flow, and if needed, our access to borrowings from our financing facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our foreseeable operating needs.  The following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nNet Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities in 2024 was largely driven by our net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash. This net source of cash primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as lower levels of inventory, which reflects our continued efforts to optimize inventory levels, partially offset by higher levels of trade receivables. Cash flows from operating activities in 2024 additionally reflected a discretionary cash contribution of $150 million to fund our pension obligation.\nCash flows from continuing operating activities in 2023 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash, which was significantly lower than the net use of cash in 2022 due to efforts in 2023 to optimize inventory levels. The net use of cash in 2023 primarily reflected lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as higher levels of trade receivables, partially offset by lower levels of prepaid expenses.\nCash flows from continuing operating activities in 2022 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash. This net use of cash primarily reflected higher levels\n47\nof inventory and prepaid expenses, as well as lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2022 additionally reflected a discretionary cash contribution of $134 million to fund our pension obligation.\nNet Cash Flows from Continuing Investing Activities\nCapital expenditures\nOur investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities, as well as support our BD 2025 strategy for growth and simplification. Capital expenditures of $725 million, $874 million and $973 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to manufacturing capacity expansions. Details of spending by segment are contained in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nPurchases of investments, net\nCash outflows from continuing investing activities in 2024 included net purchases of investments, primarily in time deposits, of $421 million.\nAcquisitions\nCash outflows for acquisitions in 2024 was attributable to the acquisition of Advanced Patient Monitoring in the fourth quarter of 2024. Cash outflows for acquisitions in 2022 reflected consideration of $1.548 billion associated with our acquisition of Parata Systems in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as cash payments relating to various strategic acquisitions we have executed as part of our growth strategy, including our acquisitions of MedKeeper, Scanwell Health, Inc, Tissuemed, Ltd., and Venclose, Inc.\nDivestitures\nCash inflows relating to our divestiture of the Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform in 2023 were $540 million. For further discussion, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nNet Cash Flows from Continuing Financing Activities\nNet cash from continuing financing activities in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included the following significant cash flows:\nAdditional disclosures regarding the equity and debt-related financing activities detailed above are provided in Notes 4 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n48\nDebt-Related Activities\nCertain measures relating to our total debt were as follows:\n(a)\nRepresents shareholders’ equity, net non-current deferred income tax liabilities, and debt.\nAdditional disclosures regarding our debt instruments are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCash and Short-term Investments\nAt September 30, 2024, total worldwide cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash, were $2.301 billion. More than half of these assets were held in the United States. We regularly review the amount of cash and short-term investments held outside of the United States and our historical foreign earnings are used to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. To fund cash needs in the United States, we rely on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and remittances from foreign subsidiaries of earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested.\nFinancing Facilities\nWe have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in place which will expire in September 2027. The credit facility provides borrowings of up to $2.750 billion, with separate sub-limits of $100 million and $194 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively. The expiration date of the credit facility, which was extended in July 2024, may be extended for up to one additional one-year period, subject to certain restrictions (including the consent of the lenders). The credit facility provides that we may, subject to additional commitments by lenders, request an additional $500 million of financing, for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to $3.250 billion. Proceeds from this facility may be used for general corporate purposes and Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.à r.l., an indirect, wholly owned finance subsidiary of BD, is authorized as an additional borrower under the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024.\nThe agreement for our revolving credit facility contains the following financial covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants, as applicable, as of September 30, 2024.\n•\nWe are required to have a leverage coverage ratio of no more than:\n◦\n4.25-to-1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter following the closing of the credit facility; or\n◦\n4.75-to-1 for the four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a material acquisition.\nWe may access commercial paper programs over the normal course of our business activities. Our U.S. and multicurrency euro commercial paper programs provide for a maximum amount of unsecured borrowings under the two programs, in aggregate, of $2.750 billion. Proceeds from these programs may be used for working capital purposes and general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, share repurchases and repayments of debt. We had $400 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024.  We have additional informal lines of credit outside the United States. Also, over the normal course of our business activities, we transfer certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements. Additional disclosures regarding sales of trade receivable assets are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n49\nAccess to Capital and Credit Ratings\nOur corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (“S&P”), Moody's Investors Service (“Moody's”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) were as follows at September 30, 2024:\nOur corporate credit ratings at September 30, 2024 were unchanged compared with our ratings at September 30, 2023.\nLower corporate debt ratings and downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing. We believe that given our debt ratings, our financial management policies, our ability to generate cash flow and the diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under purchase, debt and lease arrangements are provided in Notes 6, 16 and 18, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For any given estimate or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following policy areas require more significant judgment:\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement. Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed. For leases and for certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain\n50\ninstruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period.\nOur agreements with customers within certain organizational units including Medication Management Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment.  The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. We generally estimate standalone selling prices using list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers.  The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.\nOur gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, including rebates. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period. Additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates.\nImpairment of Assets\nGoodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with finite lives, including developed technology, and other long-lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units represent one level below reporting segments. Our review of goodwill for each reporting unit compares the fair value of the reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment test performed on July 1, 2024 did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nWe generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the value of our income producing assets. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with BD’s business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset. Actual results may differ from management’s estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nBD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.\nBD conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. BD’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in\n51\npositions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.\nWe have reviewed our needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs.     As a result, we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2024.  Additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nContingencies\nWe are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We establish accruals to the extent future losses for individual matters are probable and reasonably estimable based upon our assessment of the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes relative to these matters, as well as the potential ranges of probable losses. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to reasonably estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party.\nWhen appropriate, accruals are developed with the consultation of outside counsel regarding the nature, timing and extent of each matter. The accruals may change in the future as new information for an individual matter becomes available or due to changes in our litigation strategy.  We record expected recoveries, up to the amount of loss recognized, from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when realization of recovery is deemed probable.\nGiven the uncertain nature of litigation, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and/or consolidated cash flows.\nBenefit Plans\nWe have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations and costs that are measured using actuarial valuations which include assumptions for the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion.\nThe discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date (September 30). Specifically for the U.S. plans, we will use a discount rate of 4.98% for 2025, which was based on an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date.  To calculate the pension expense in 2025, we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost. Additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2025 are provided in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently due to the long-term nature of the assumption. This assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. We will use a long-term expected rate of return on\n52\nplan assets assumption of 7.5% for the U.S. pension plan in 2025. We believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors.\nSensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our U.S. pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows:\n•\nDiscount rate — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the total U.S. net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs.  This estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the company-specific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost.\n•\nExpected return on plan assets — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $4 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan costs.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. BD and its representatives may also, from time to time, make certain forward-looking statements in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, and our reports to shareholders. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “will,” “may,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance (including volume growth, pricing, sales and earnings per share growth, and cash flows) and statements regarding our strategy for growth, liquidity, future product development, regulatory approvals, competitive position and expenditures.  All statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are, and will be, based on management’s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events, developments and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations.\nThe following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. For further discussion of certain of these factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\n•\nGeneral global, regional or national economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital market volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession, that may result in unfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for our products and services, impact the prices we can charge for our products and services, disrupt our transportation networks or other aspects of our supply chain, impair our ability to produce our products, or increase borrowing costs.\n•\nThe impact of inflation and disruptions in our global supply chain on BD and our suppliers (particularly sole-source suppliers and providers of sterilization services), including fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, used in the production or sterilization of our products, transportation constraints, disruptions and delays, product shortages, energy shortages or increased energy costs, labor shortages or disputes, and increased operating and labor costs.\n53\n•\nConditions in international markets, including social and political conditions, geopolitical developments such as the continuation and/or escalation of the evolving situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, civil unrest, political conflict, terrorist activity, governmental changes, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders, economic sanctions, export controls, tariffs and other protectionist measures, barriers to market participation (such as local company and products preferences), difficulties in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and governmental expropriation of assets. Our international operations also increase our compliance risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and bribery laws, as well as regulatory and privacy laws.\n•\nCost-containment efforts in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business, such as alternative payment reform, government-imposed pay back provisions, increased use of competitive bidding and tenders, including, without limitation, any expansion of the volume-based procurement process in China or the implementation of similar cost-containment efforts.\n•\nCompetitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions and technologies, including the use of artificial intelligence, by our current or future competitors, consolidation or strategic alliances among healthcare companies, distributors and/or payers of healthcare to improve their competitive position or develop new models for the delivery of healthcare, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), new entrants into our markets and changes in the practice of medicine.\n•\nChanges in the way healthcare services are delivered, including transition of more care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management, which may affect the demand for our products and services. Additionally, budget constraints and staffing shortages, particularly shortages of nursing staff, may affect the prioritization of healthcare services, which could also impact the demand for certain of our products and services.\n•\nOur ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected sales volumes and pricing of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others.\n•\nChanges in coverage policies or reimbursement levels, or adverse decisions relating to our products and services by governments or third-party payers, which could reduce demand for our products or the price we can charge for such products.\n•\nProduct efficacy or safety concerns or non-compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding our products (such as non-compliance of our products with registration requirements resulting from modifications to such products, or other factors, including, but not limited to, with respect to BD Alaris™ pumps and related sets and BD Vacutainer\nTM\n) resulting in product recalls, lost revenue or other actions being taken with respect to products in the field or the ability to continue selling new products to customers (including restrictions on future product clearances and civil penalties), product liability or other claims and damage to our reputation. As a result of the CareFusion acquisition, our U.S. infusion pump business is operating under a Consent Decree with the FDA. The Consent Decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order our U.S. infusion pump business to cease manufacturing and distributing products, recall products or take other actions, and order the payment of significant monetary damages if the business subject to the decree fails to comply with any provision of the Consent Decree. In accordance with our commitments to the FDA, the overall timing of replacement or remediation of the BD Alaris™ Infusion Systems and return to market in the U.S. may be impacted by, among other things, customer readiness, supply continuity and our continued engagement with the FDA.\n•\nChanges in the domestic and foreign healthcare industry, in medical practices or in patient preferences that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including cost-reduction measures instituted by and the continued consolidation among healthcare providers.\n54\n•\nThe effects of regulatory or other events (such as public health crises) that adversely impact our supply chain, including our ability to manufacture (including sterilize) our products (particularly where production of a product line or sterilization operations are concentrated in one or a few plants), source materials or components or services from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing (including sterilization), or provide products to our customers, including events that impact key distributors. In particular, there has been increased regulatory focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide in sterilization processes, and additional regulatory requirements may be imposed in the future that could adversely impact BD or our third-party sterilization providers.\n•\nIT system disruptions, breaches or breakdowns, including through cyberattacks, ransom attacks or cyber-intrusion, which could impair our ability or that of our customers, suppliers and other business partners to conduct business, result in the loss of BD trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of patients, including sensitive personal data, or result in efficacy or safety concerns for certain of our products, and result in investigations, legal proceedings, liability, expense or reputational damage or actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation.\n•\nDifficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and registrations in the U.S. and abroad, obtain intellectual property protection for our products, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which could preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs.\n•\nThe impact of changes in U.S. federal or foreign laws and policies that could affect fiscal and tax policies, taxation (including tax reforms, such as the implementation of a global minimum tax, that could adversely impact multinational corporations), and international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements. In particular, tariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers imposed by the U.S. or other countries could adversely impact our supply chain costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations.\n•\nDeficit reduction efforts or other actions that reduce the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, which could weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales.\n•\nFluctuations in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research.\n•\nThe impact of business combinations or divestitures, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquisition-related costs, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.\n•\nRisks relating to our overall level of indebtedness, including our ability to service our debt and refinance our indebtedness, which is dependent upon the capital markets and the overall macroeconomic environment and our financial condition at such time.\n•\nAny impact that public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics may have on our business, the global economy and the global healthcare system. This may include decreases in the demand for our products, disruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers and customers, disruptions to our supply chain, or increases in transportation costs.\n•\nThe risks associated with the qualification of the spin-off of our former Diabetes Care business as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n•\nOur ability to penetrate or expand our operations in emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions, and how well we are able to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities and distribution networks.\n55\n•\nOur ability to recruit and retain key employees and the impact of labor conditions which could increase employee turnover or increase our labor and operating costs and negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our business.\n•\nFluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise.\n•\nThe impact of climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, such as regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, zero-carbon energy and sustainability mandates and related disclosure requirements, and additional taxes on fuel and energy, and changing customer and other stakeholder preferences and requirements, such as those regarding the use of materials of concern, increased demand for products with lower environmental footprints, and for companies to set and demonstrate progress against sustainability goals and greenhouse gas reduction targets.\n•\nNatural disasters, including the impacts of hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, fires, earthquakes and floods and other extreme weather events, global health pandemics, war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts that could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability, resulting in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or cause interruptions in our supply chain.\n•\nPending and potential future litigation or other proceedings asserting, and/or investigations concerning and/or subpoenas and requests seeking information with respect to, alleged violations of law (including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid) and/or sales and marketing practices (such as investigative subpoenas and the civil investigative demands received by BD)), potential anti-corruption and related internal control violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, antitrust claims, securities law claims, environmental and product liability matters (including pending claims relating to ethlyene oxide, our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women, vena cava filter products and implantable ports, which involve, or could involve in the future, lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district or other consolidated proceedings), data privacy breaches and patent infringement, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.\n•\nNew or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including, without limitation, laws relating to sales practices, environmental protection and reporting, price controls, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, employment, labor, and licensing and regulatory requirements for new products and products in the post-marketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD.\n•\nThe effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BD’s business or operations, including the effect on BD’s reputation or demand for its products.\n•\nThe effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BD’s pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.\n•\nOur ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake.\nThe foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.\n56"

    "text": "Reports of Management\nManagement’s Responsibilities\nThe following financial statements have been prepared by management in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include, where required, amounts based on the best estimates and judgments of management. The integrity and objectivity of data in the financial statements and elsewhere in this Annual Report are the responsibility of management.\nIn fulfilling its responsibilities for the integrity of the data presented and to safeguard the Company’s assets, management employs a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that the Company’s assets are protected and that transactions are appropriately authorized, recorded and summarized. This system of control is supported by the selection of qualified personnel, by organizational assignments that provide appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibilities, and by the dissemination of written policies and procedures. This control structure is further reinforced by a program of internal audits, including a policy that requires responsive action by management.\nThe Board of Directors monitors the internal control system, including internal accounting and financial reporting controls, through its Audit Committee, which consists of five independent Directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to review the work of each and to satisfy itself that they are properly discharging their responsibilities. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with its members, with and without management present, to discuss the scope and results of their audits including internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).\nOn September 3, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Edwards Lifesciences’ Critical Care product group (“Critical Care”), which was renamed as BD Advanced Patient Monitoring (“Advanced Patient Monitoring”). While the Company has extended its oversight and monitoring processes that support its internal control over financial reporting, as well as its disclosure controls and procedures, the Company continues to integrate the acquired operations of Advanced Patient Monitoring. As such, the Company has excluded Advanced Patient Monitoring from its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. This exclusion is in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's general guidance that a recently acquired business may be omitted from the assessment scope for up to one year from the date of acquisition. The Advanced Patient Monitoring business had total assets that represented approximately 2% of the Company's consolidated total assets at September 30, 2024, and total revenues that represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2024.\nBased on the Company's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the criteria noted above, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024.\n58\nThe financial statements and internal control over financial reporting have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst & Young’s reports with respect to fairness of the presentation of the financial statements, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, are included herein.\n59\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Becton, Dickinson and Company (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework),\nand our report dated November 27, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n60\n61\n62\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Becton, Dickinson and Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Becton, Dickinson and Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of BD Advanced Patient Monitoring, which is included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 2% of total assets as of September 30, 2024 and less than 1% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of BD Advanced Patient Monitoring.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes\nand our report dated November 27, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n63\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n64\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nYears Ended September 30\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n65\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nYears Ended September 30\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n66\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nSeptember 30\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n67\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nYears Ended September 30\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n68\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nMillions of dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise specified\nNote 1 —\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Becton, Dickinson and Company (the \"Company\" or \"BD\") have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. Our fiscal year ends on September 30.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company completed the spin-off of its Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company. The historical results of the Diabetes Care business (previously included in BD’s Medical segment) that was contributed to Embecta Corp (\"Embecta\") in the spin-off were reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Additional disclosures regarding the spin-off are provided in Note 2.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its majority-owned subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany transactions. The Company has no material interests in variable interest entities.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at time of purchase.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of cash restricted from withdrawal and usage and largely represents funds that are restricted for certain product liability matters, which are further discussed in Note 6.\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business and the resulting trade receivables are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company’s estimate of expected credit losses relating to trade receivables and is determined based on historical experience, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other specific account data. Amounts are written off against the allowances for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that a customer account is not collectable.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of approximate cost or net realizable value determined on the first-in, first-out basis.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are principally provided on the straight-line basis over estimated useful lives, which range from\n20\nto\n45\nyears for buildings,\nfour\nto\n20\nyears for machinery and equipment and\none\nto\n20\n69\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nyears for leasehold improvements.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $\n676\nmillion,\n$\n696\nmillion and $\n672\nmillion\nin fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company’s unamortized intangible assets include goodwill that arises from acquisitions of businesses. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment using quantitative models. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. The Company’s reporting units represent one level below reporting segments. The Company reviews goodwill for each reporting unit by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its carrying value. The annual impairment review performed on July 1, 2024 indicated that all identified reporting units’ fair values exceeded their respective carrying values.\nAmortized intangible assets include developed technology assets which arise from acquisitions. These assets represent acquired intellectual property that is already technologically feasible upon the acquisition date or acquired in-process research and development assets that are completed subsequent to acquisition. Developed technology assets are generally amortized over periods ranging from\n15\nto\n20\nyears, using the straight-line method. Customer relationship assets are generally amortized over periods ranging from\n10\nto\n15\nyears, using the straight-line method. Other intangibles with finite useful lives, which include patents, are amortized over periods principally ranging from\none\nto\n40\nyears, using the straight-line method. Finite-lived intangible assets, including developed technology assets, are periodically reviewed when impairment indicators are present to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. The carrying values of these finite-lived assets are compared to the undiscounted cash flows they are expected to generate and an impairment loss is recognized in operating results to the extent any finite-lived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its calculated fair value.\nForeign Currency Translation\nGenerally, foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from such translation, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature, are included in the foreign currency translation adjustments in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement.  Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized upon customer acceptance of these installed products. Revenue for certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, is recognized ratably over the contract term. When arrangements include multiple performance obligations, the total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Variable consideration such as rebates, sales discounts and sales returns are estimated and treated as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized. These estimates are based on contractual terms, historical practices, and current trends, and are adjusted as new information becomes available. Revenues exclude any taxes that the Company collects from customers and remits to tax authorities.\nEquipment lease transactions with customers are evaluated and classified as either operating or sales-type leases. Generally, these arrangements are accounted for as operating leases and therefore, revenue is recognized at the contracted rate over the rental period defined within the customer agreement.\n70\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nAdditional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for revenue recognition are provided in Note 7.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nThe Company considers its shipping and handling costs to be contract fulfillment costs and records them within\nSelling and administrative expense.\nShipping expense was $\n702\nmillion, $\n733\nmillion and $\n751\nmillion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nContingencies\nThe Company establishes accruals for future losses which are both probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nAdditional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for contingencies are provided in Note 6.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nAll derivatives are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized. The cash flows related to the Company's derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows for all other derivatives, including undesignated hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating or financing activities.\nAdditional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for derivative instruments are provided in Note 14.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has reviewed its needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and continues to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. As a result, the Company is permanently reinvested with respect to all of its historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2024. Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters.\nThe Company maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in the tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Additional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 17.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company has elected to account for its GILTI tax due as a period expense in the year the tax is incurred.\n71\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. In computing diluted earnings per share, only potential common shares that are dilutive (i.e., those that reduce earnings per share or increase loss per share) are included in the calculation.\nFair Value Measurements\nA fair value hierarchy is applied to prioritize inputs used in measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are detailed below. Additional disclosures regarding the Company’s fair value measurements are provided in Notes 10 and 15.\nLevel 1 — Inputs to the valuation methodology which represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Inputs to the valuation methodology which include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 — Inputs to the valuation methodology which are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates or assumptions affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nNote 2 —\nDivestitures\nSurgical Instrumentation Platform\nThe Company completed the sale of its Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform in August 2023. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $\n268\nmillion, which was recorded as a component of\nOther operating expense (income), net\nin fiscal year 2023. The historical financial results for the Surgical Instrumentation platform have not been classified as a discontinued operation.\nSpin-Off of Embecta Corp.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company completed the spin-off of its former Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company named Embecta through a distribution of Embecta’s publicly traded common stock (listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol \"EMBC\") to BD’s shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 22, 2022 (the “record date”). The Company distributed one share of Embecta common stock for every five common shares of BD outstanding as of the record date and shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares of Embecta common stock. BD retained no ownership interest in Embecta subsequent to the spin-off. The distribution is expected to qualify and has been treated as tax-free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On March 31, 2022, Embecta used a portion of the proceeds from financing transactions to make a cash distribution of approximately $\n1.266\nbillion to the Company.\nThe Company and Embecta entered into various agreements to effect the spin-off and provide a framework for the relationship between the Company and Embecta after the spin-off. Such agreements include the separation and distribution agreement, as well as the following ongoing agreements: a cannula supply agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a transition services agreement, manufacturing and supply agreements, a lease agreement, a distribution agreement to support commercial operations, a logistics services agreement and other agreements including an employee matters agreement and a tax matters agreement. Under these agreements, the Company has continued to provide certain products and services to\n72\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nEmbecta following the spin-off. The agreements do not provide the Company with the ability to influence the operating or financial policies of Embecta subsequent to the spin-off date. Amounts included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 as a result of these agreements are detailed in Note 19.\nDetails of\n(Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\n, which represent the historical results of the Diabetes Care business prior to the spin-off date of April 1, 2022, are as follows:\nIn fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded expenses of $\n46\nmillion within\n(Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net\nof Tax\nrelated to a foreign tax associated with the spin-off. For fiscal year 2022, in the table above,\nOther operating expense, net,\nincludes\n$\n30\nmillion\nof costs incurred by the Company to execute the spin-off and other costs for related residual activities, as well as $\n78\nmillion of separation costs incurred by the Company prior to the spin-off date, including those for consulting, legal, tax and other advisory services associated with the spin-off.\nThe amounts of\nRevenues\nand\nCost of products sold\nfrom discontinued operations detailed above include previously eliminated intercompany transactions that occurred between BD and Embecta which resulted in a third-party sale in the same period.\nNote 3 —\nAccounting Changes\nNew Accounting Principles Adopted\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued an accounting standard update that requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding supplier finance programs. The new disclosure requirements are intended to help investors better consider the effect of these programs on a company's working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. The Company adopted this accounting standard on October 1, 2023, and disclosures regarding the Company’s supplier finance programs are provided in Note 15.\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company early-adopted an accounting standard update issued by the FASB, which requires an entity to apply the provisions of Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" (\"ASC 606\") when recognizing and measuring contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. The Company’s adoption of this accounting standard update for\n73\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nbusiness combinations that occurred during fiscal year 2022 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Principles Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires the Company to disclose more detailed information about the types of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion) included in each relevant income statement expense caption. The update is effective for the Company beginning with its fiscal year 2028 reporting and for interim reporting beginning with its fiscal year 2029. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this update will have on its disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires more disaggregated information to be included in the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid annual disclosures. This update is effective for the Company beginning in its fiscal year 2026 and the Company is currently evaluating the impact that this update will have on its disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update that requires more disaggregated expense information about a public entity’s reportable segments. This update is effective for the Company beginning with its fiscal year 2025 reporting and for interim reporting beginning with its fiscal year 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this update will have on its disclosures.\n74\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 4 —\nShareholders’ Equity\nChanges in certain components of shareholders’ equity were as follows:\n(a)\nCommon stock held in trusts consists of the Company’s shares held in rabbi trusts in connection with deferred compensation under the Company’s employee salary and bonus deferral plan and directors’ deferral plan.\n(b)\nRepresents the conversion, in accordance with their terms, of\n1.500\nmillion mandatory convertible preferred shares that were issued in May 2020 were converted into\n5.955\nmillion shares of BD common stock on the mandatory conversion date of June 1, 2023.\n75\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nShare Repurchases\nIn fiscal year 2024, the Company executed and settled accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements for the repurchase of\n2.118\nmillion shares of its common stock for total consideration of $\n500\nmillion, excluding a\n1\n% excise tax on share repurchases of $\n3\nmillion, which was recorded as an increase to\nTreasury stock.\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Company executed an ASR agreement in which\n1.953\nmillion common shares were repurchased and delivered in fiscal year 2022 for $\n500\nmillion, and were recorded as an increase to\nTreasury stock.\nAlso in fiscal year 2022, $\n150\nmillion was recorded as an increase to\nTreasury stock\n, with an offsetting increase to\nCapital in excess of par value\nfor the delivery of\n462\nthousand shares upon final settlement of a separate ASR agreement which was executed in fiscal year 2021.\nThe share repurchases discussed above were made pursuant to the repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors on September 24, 2013 for\n10\nmillion shares, which was fully utilized as of September 30, 2022, and a repurchas\ne program authorized by the Board of Directors on November 3, 2021 for up to an additional\n10\nmillion shares of BD common stock, for which there is no expiration date.\nThe components and changes of\nAccumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss)\nwere as follows:\nThe amount of foreign currency translation recognized in other comprehensive income during the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 included net (losses) gains relating to net investment hedges, as further discussed in Note 14. The amount recognized in other comprehensive income relating to cash flow hedges in 2024 is primarily related to foreign exchange contracts and forward starting interest rate swaps, which were terminated during fiscal year 2024. The amounts recognized in other comprehensive income relating to cash flow hedges in 2023 and 2022 are primarily related to forward starting interest rate swaps. Additional disclosures regarding the Company's derivatives are provided in Note 14.\nThe tax impacts for benefit plans and cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income before reclassifications in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results. The tax impacts for reclassifications out of\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nrelating to benefit plans and cash flow hedges in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were also immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\n76\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 5 —\nEarnings per Share\nThe weighted average common shares used in the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share (shares in thousands) for the years ended September 30 were as follows:\n(a)\nIn 2023 and 2022, dilutive share equivalents associated with mandatory convertible preferred stock of\n4\nmillion and\n6\nmillion, respectively, were excluded from the diluted shares outstanding calculation because the result would have been antidilutive. All of the mandatory convertible preferred shares outstanding were converted during fiscal year 2023, as further discussed in Note 4.\n(b)\nIn 2024,\n1\nmillion of certain share-based compensation awards were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as the exercise prices of these awards were greater than the average market price of the Company’s common shares. In 2023 and 2022,\nno\nsuch awards were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. Additional disclosures regarding the Company’s share-based compensation are provided in Note 9.\n(c)\nRepresents dilutive share equivalents from Series C preferred shares that temporarily replaced shares of common stock held in trusts to adhere to trust requirements until the Company’s spin-off of its Diabetes Care business on April 1, 2022 was completed.\nNote 6 —\nCommitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nThe Company has certain future purchase commitments entered in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, these commitments aggregated to approximately $\n1.831\nbillion and will be expended over the next several years.\nContingencies\nThe Company is involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability and environmental matters in certain U.S. and international locations.\nGiven the uncertain nature of litigation generally, the Company is not able, in all cases, to reasonably estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of litigation in which the Company is a party. Even if the Company believes it has meritorious defenses, from time to time the Company engages in settlement discussions and mediation and considers settlements taking into account various factors including, among other things, developments in such legal proceedings and the resulting risks and uncertainties. These activities have resulted in settlements for certain matters and going forward could result in further settlements, which may be confidential and could be significant and result in charges in excess of accruals.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company establishes accruals to the extent future losses are probable and reasonably estimable. With respect to putative class action lawsuits and certain tort actions in the United States and certain of the Canadian lawsuits described below or in our other SEC filings, the Company may not be able to determine if a probable loss exists for the following reasons: (i) all or certain of the proceedings are in early stages; (ii) the Company has not received and reviewed complete information regarding all or certain of the plaintiffs and their medical conditions; and/or (iii) there are significant factual issues to be resolved. In\n77\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\naddition, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class. With respect to certain of the civil investigative demands (“CIDs”) served by the Department of Justice which are discussed below, the Company may not be able to determine if a probable loss exists, unless otherwise noted, for the following reasons: (i) all or certain of the proceedings are in early stages; and/or (ii) there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved.\nProduct Liability Matters\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company is defending approximately\n6,610\nproduct liability claims involving the Company’s line of hernia repair devices (collectively, the “Hernia Product Claims”).The Company’s outstanding Hernia Product Claims as of September 30, 2023 were approximately\n34,845\n.  The reduction in the number of outstanding claims primarily reflects a settlement agreement that was consummated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 to resolve the vast majority of the Company’s existing hernia litigation. The aggregate amount payable pursuant to this settlement is within the Company's current product liability accrual for this matter and will be paid out over a multi-year period. The majority of the outstanding claims are currently pending in a coordinated proceeding in Rhode Island State Court (“RI”) and in a federal multi-district litigation (“MDL”) established in the Southern District of Ohio, but claims are also pending in other state and/or federal court jurisdictions. In addition, outstanding claims include multiple putative class actions in Canada. Generally, the Hernia Product Claims seek damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from use of the products. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in these matters. There are no trials currently scheduled.\nThe Company also continues to be a defendant in certain other mass tort litigation. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is defending product liability claims involving the Company’s line of pelvic mesh products, the majority of which are pending in a coordinated proceeding in New Jersey Superior Court and in various federal court jurisdictions, the Company’s line of inferior vena cava (“IVC”) filter products, which are pending in various jurisdictions, and the Company’s line of implantable ports, the majority of which are pending in an MDL in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in these matters.\nIn most product liability litigations like those described above, plaintiffs allege a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. In many of these cases, the Company has not yet received and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions and, consequently, is unable to fully evaluate the claims. The Company expects that it will receive and review additional information regarding any remaining unsettled product liability matters.\nOther Matters\nOn November 2, 2020, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned Jankowski v. Forlenza, et al., Civ. No. 2:20-cv-15474, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey by a shareholder, derivatively on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Company’s directors and officers. The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty; violations of sections 10(b), 14(a) and 21D of the Exchange Act, and insider trading. The complaint principally alleges, that the Company made misleading statements regarding Alaris\nTM\ninfusion pumps in a proxy statement and other SEC filings. A second federal derivative action was filed on January 24, 2021, and the two actions were consolidated and stayed. In March 2021, the Company received letters from two additional shareholders which, in general, mirrored the allegations in the derivative actions, and demanded, among other things, that the Board of Directors pursue claims against members of management for claimed breaches of fiduciary duties. Consistent with New Jersey law, the Board appointed a special committee to review the allegations and demands in the derivative actions and demand letters. Following an investigation, the special committee determined that no action was warranted, and rejected the shareholders’ demands, communicating its determination to counsel for the shareholders. On January 10, 2023, one of the two shareholders referenced above filed a separate derivative action that: (i) is generally consistent with the shareholder letter and the two prior actions; and (ii) purports to challenge the reasonableness of the special\n78\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\ncommittee’s process and determination. That action was also stayed. Following entry of a stipulated scheduling order for an amended complaint and motion to dismiss the consolidated federal action, the case schedule was adjourned without date pending mediation. Mediation proceedings have taken place, with negotiations continuing. On September 10, 2024, the Company received an additional substantially identical shareholder demand letter and on September 26, 2024, that shareholder filed a second substantially identical state court derivative action. The Company believes that the defendants have meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend these matters, if ongoing negotiations are unproductive.\nBeginning in February 2021, the Company received subpoenas from the Enforcement Division of the SEC requesting information from the Company relating to, among other things, certain reporting issues involving BD Alaris\nTM\ninfusion pumps included in SEC disclosures prior to 2021. The Company is cooperating with the SEC and is engaged in discussions with the SEC with respect to a potential resolution of this matter. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of the discussions with the SEC, the Company expects that any resolution will likely require the Company to pay monetary penalties and/or undertake other remedial actions, any of which could potentially be material. As a result, although no agreement has been reached, the Company recorded charges of $\n50\nmillion and $\n125\nmillion in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, respectively, to\nOther operating expense (income), net\nto accrue an estimated $\n175\nmillion liability as of September 30, 2024 based on these discussions. However, the Company cannot anticipate the timing, scope, outcome or ultimate impact of the investigation, financial or otherwise, including but not limited to what actions the SEC might pursue against the Company and/or individuals. As a result, the ultimate resolution of this matter is unknown at this time, and it is possible that the amount of the Company’s liability could significantly exceed its currently accrued amount.\nIn July 2017, C.R. Bard, which was acquired by the Company in December 2017, received a CID from the Department of Justice seeking documents and information relating to an investigation into possible violations of the False Claims Act in connection with the sales and marketing of FloChec® and QuantaFlo\nTM\ndevices. The Company has responded to these requests and met with the Department of Justice in February and July 2024; discussions are ongoing.\nIn April 2019, the Department of Justice served the Company and CareFusion with CIDs seeking information regarding certain of CareFusion’s contracts with the Department of Veteran’s Affairs, some dating back more than 10 years, for certain products, including Alaris\nTM\nand Pyxis\nTM\ndevices, in connection with a civil investigation of possible violations of the False Claims Act, and the government later expanded the investigation to include several additional contracts. The government has made several requests for documents and interviews or depositions of Company personnel. The Company is cooperating with the government and responding to these requests.\nIn September 2021, the Company received a CID related to an inquiry initiated by the Department of Justice in the Northern District of Georgia in 2018 concerning sales and marketing practices with respect to certain aspects of the Company’s urology business. After multiple document productions and interviews, the Company and the government mediated the case in an effort to resolve this dispute; an agreement was reached to resolve this matter for an adequately accrued amount that is not material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.\nIn April 2023, the Department of Justice served the Company with a CID seeking information regarding the Company’s Genesis\nTM\ncontainer products in connection with an investigation of possible violations of the False Claims Act. The government has requested documents and the Company is cooperating with the government and responding to its requests.\nThe Company was sued in state and federal courts in Georgia by plaintiffs who work or reside near Company facilities in Covington, GA, where ethylene oxide (“EtO”) sterilization activities take place. The federal cases have been dismissed and refiled in state court. The plaintiffs in the cases seek compensatory and punitive damages. Pursuant to Georgia statute, punitive damages in these cases are generally capped at $\n250,000\nper claimant, unless the plaintiff can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the Company acted, or failed to act, with a specific intent to cause harm. The cases allege a variety of injuries, including but not\n79\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nlimited to multiple types of cancer, allegedly attributable to exposure to EtO. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has approximately\n350\nof such suits involving approximately\n360\nplaintiffs asserting individual personal injury claims; approximately\n50\nof the cases also allege injury caused by exposure to a chemical of another defendant entirely unrelated to the Company. No cases have yet been tried although a trial date has been set for one such case scheduled for April 2025. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in these matters.\nIn 2015, legislation was enacted in Italy which requires medical technology companies to make payments to the Italian government if Italy’s medical device expenditures exceed annual regional expenditure ceilings. The amount of these payments is based on the amount by which the regional ceilings for the given year were exceeded. Considerable uncertainty has existed regarding the enforceability and implementation of this payback legislation since it was enacted and the Company, as well as other medical device companies, have filed appeals which challenge the enforceability of this legislation. In July 2024, the Italian Constitutional Court issued two judgments which concluded that the medical device payback legislation is constitutional; however, litigation proceedings before Italian Courts are still pending. While the Company has recorded a preliminary estimate of the liability related to this matter, ultimate resolution is unknown at this time, and it is possible that the amount of the Company’s liability could differ from the currently accrued amount. This estimated amount, which substantially relates to years prior to the current fiscal year, was recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 as a $\n62\nmillion reduction of Revenues.\nIn May 2024, CareFusion 303, Inc., the Company’s subsidiary that manufactures its BD Pyxis\nTM\ndispensing equipment, received a Form 483 Notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) that contained observations of non-conformance with the FDA’s quality system and Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulations. In November 2024, the Company received a Warning Letter that contained alleged violations of the quality system regulations, MDR regulation, the corrections and removals reporting regulation and law. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $\n28\nmillion liability for estimated future costs associated with certain actions required to respond to the Warning Letter and to address the non-conformities. The Company is currently working to respond to this Warning Letter; however, no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of the noted non-conformities, or that corrective actions proposed and taken by CareFusion 303, Inc. will be adequate to address the non-conformities. Any failure to adequately address this Warning Letter may result in regulatory actions initiated by the FDA without further notice, which may include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction and civil monetary penalties. As a result, the ultimate resolution of this Warning Letter and its impact on the Company’s operations is unknown at this time, and it is possible that the amount of the Company’s liability could exceed its currently accrued amount.\nThe Company is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in each of these matters.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the other legal matters discussed above, nor can it predict whether any outcome will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and/or consolidated cash flows. Further, the Company may not be able to determine if a probable loss exists for certain of the other legal matters discussed above, and accordingly, the Company has recorded no provisions for such matters in its consolidated results of operations.\nThe Company is a potentially responsible party to a number of federal administrative proceedings in the United States brought under the Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as “Superfund,” and similar state laws. The Company also is subject to administrative proceedings under environmental laws in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The affected sites are in varying stages of development. In some instances, the remedy has been completed, while in others, environmental studies are underway or commencing. For several sites, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all or part of cleanup costs. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the Company’s experience, current information and applicable law, the Company does not expect\n80\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nthese proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations and/or consolidated cash flows.\nLitigation Accruals\nThe Company regularly monitors and evaluates the status of product liability and other litigated matters, and may, from time-to-time, engage in settlement discussions and mediation taking into consideration, among other things, developments in the litigation and the risks and uncertainties associated therewith. These activities have resulted in confidential settlements and going forward could result in further settlements, the terms of which may be confidential and could be significant and result in charges in excess of accruals. A determination of the accrual amounts for these contingencies is made after analysis of each litigation matter. When appropriate, the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and, in the case of certain mass tort litigation, actuarial specialists regarding the nature, timing, and extent of each matter.\nDuring fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax (benefit) charge to\nOther operating expense (income), net,\nof approximately $(\n36\n) million, $\n26\nmillion and $\n21\nmillion, respectively, related to certain of the product liability matters discussed above under the heading “Product Liability Matters,” including the related legal defense costs. The benefit recorded in fiscal year 2024 primarily reflected the favorable resolution of claims during the fiscal year.\nThe Company considers relevant information when estimating its product liability accruals, including, but not limited to: the nature, number, and quality of unfiled and filed claims; the rate of claims being filed; the status of settlement discussions with plaintiffs’ counsel; the allegations and documentation supporting or refuting such allegations; publicly available information regarding similar medical device mass tort settlements; historical information regarding other product liability settlements involving the Company; and the stage of litigation. Because currently available information regarding product liability matters is often limited, there is inherent uncertainty and volatility relating to the Company’s estimate of product liability. As additional information becomes available, the Company records adjustments to its product liability accruals as required.\nAccruals for the Company's product liability claims which are discussed above, as well as the related legal defense costs, amounted to approximately $\n1.7\nbillion and $\n1.9\nbillion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These accruals are recorded within\nAccrued expenses\nand\nDeferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities\non the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the Company’s product liability accrual as of September 30, 2024, as compared with September 30, 2023, largely reflected reductions to the accrual due to the payment of settlements and legal fees, as well as the adjustment of $\n36\nmillion noted above. The decrease in the number of outstanding hernia repair device claims discussed above did not materially impact the Company’s product liability accrual because the aggregate amount payable pursuant to this settlement agreement will be paid out over a multi-year period. The accrual also reflects a determination that the remaining outstanding hernia repair device claims are generally of lower quality. Claim activity during the fiscal year 2024 relating to the pelvic mesh device and IVC filter matters did not materially impact the Company’s product liability accrual as of September 30, 2024.\nThe particular outcome in any one product liability trial is typically not representative of potential outcomes of all cases or claims. Because the accrual already contemplates a wide range of possible outcomes, including those with a de minimis value, individual outcomes generally do not impact the value of other cases in the total case inventory or the overall product liability accrual.\nIn view of the uncertainties discussed above, the Company could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and/or consolidated cash flows.\n81\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 7 —\nRevenues\nThe Company sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products which are distributed through independent distribution channels and directly by BD through sales representatives. End-users of the Company's products include healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public.\nTiming of Revenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement.  Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed. For certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period.\nMeasurement of Revenues\nThe Company acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and as such, generally records revenues on a gross basis. Revenues exclude any taxes that the Company collects from customers and remits to tax authorities. The Company considers its shipping and handling costs to be costs of contract fulfillment and has made the accounting policy election to record these costs within\nSelling and administrative expense\n.\nPayment terms extended to the Company's customers are based upon commercially reasonable terms for the markets in which the Company's products are sold. Because the Company generally expects to receive payment within one year or less from when control of a product is transferred to the customer, the Company does not generally adjust its revenues for the effects of a financing component. The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of its trade receivables. Such estimated credit losses are determined based on historical loss experiences, customer-specific credit risk, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, such as country or regional risks that are not captured in the historical loss information. Amounts are written off against the allowances for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that a customer account is uncollectable. The allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables is not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nThe Company's gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which are recorded in the same period that the underlying revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration includes rebates, sales discounts and sales returns. Because these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations, judgment is required when determining the impact of these revenue deductions on gross revenues for a reporting period. Rebates provided by the Company are based upon prices determined under the Company's agreements with its end-user customers. Additional factors considered in the estimate of the Company's rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to the Company's distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates. The Company’s rebate liabilities are classified as an offset to\nTrade receivables, net\n, or as\nAccounts payable\nor\nAccrued expenses\n, depending on the form of settlement and were $\n749\nmillion and $\n669\nmillion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impact of other forms of variable consideration, including sales discounts and sales returns, is not material to the Company's revenues. Additional disclosures relating to sales discounts and sales returns are provided in Note 19.\nThe Company's agreements with customers within certain organizational units including Medication Management Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above. The transaction price for these agreements\n82\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nis allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which the Company would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The Company generally estimates standalone selling prices using its list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers.\nEffects of Revenue Arrangements on Consolidated Balance Sheets\nDue to the nature of the majority of the Company's products and services, the Company typically does not incur costs to fulfill a contract in advance of providing the customer with goods or services. Capitalized contract costs associated with the costs to fulfill contracts for certain products in the Medication Management Solutions organizational unit are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company's costs to obtain contracts are comprised of sales commissions which are paid to the Company's employees or third party agents.  The majority of the sales commissions incurred by the Company relate to revenue that is recognized over a period that is less than one year and as such, the Company has elected a practical expedient provided under ASC 606 to record the majority of its expense associated with sales commissions as it is incurred. Commissions relating to revenues recognized over a period longer than one year are recorded as assets which are amortized over the period over which the revenues underlying the commissions are recognized. Capitalized contract costs related to such commissions are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company records contract liabilities for unearned revenue that is allocated to performance obligations such as extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, which are performed over time as discussed further above.\nAccrued expenses\non the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, included approximately $\n482\nmillion and $\n412\nmillion, respectively, of contract liabilities. The Company's liability for product warranties provided under its agreements with customers is not material to its consolidated balance sheets.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe Company's obligations relative to service contracts, which are further discussed above, and pending installations of equipment, primarily in the Company's Medication Management Solutions unit, represent unsatisfied performance obligations of the Company. The revenues under existing contracts with original expected durations of more than one year, which are attributable to products and/or services that have not yet been installed or provided, are estimated to be approximately $\n2.3\nbillion at September 30, 2024. The Company expects to recognize the majority of this revenue over the next\nthree years\n.\nWithin the Company's Medication Management Solutions, Medication Delivery Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions, and Biosciences units, some contracts also contain minimum purchase commitments of reagents or other consumables and the future sales of these consumables represent additional unsatisfied performance obligations of the Company. The revenue attributable to the unsatisfied minimum purchase commitment-related performance obligations, for contracts with original expected durations of more than one year, is estimated to be approximately $\n2.1\nbillion at September 30, 2024. This revenue will be recognized over the customer relationship periods.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nA disaggregation of the Company's revenues by segment, organizational unit and geographic region is provided in Note 8.\nNote 8 —\nSegment Data\nThe Company's organizational structure is based upon\nthree\nworldwide business segments: BD Medical (“Medical”), BD Life Sciences (“Life Sciences”) and BD Interventional (\"Interventional\"). The Company’s segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately because each one develops, manufactures and markets distinct products and services.\n83\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nMedical\nMedical produces a broad array of medical technologies and devices that are used to help improve healthcare delivery in a wide range of settings. The primary customers served by Medical are hospitals and clinics; physicians’ office practices; consumers and retail pharmacies; governmental and nonprofit public health agencies; pharmaceutical companies; and healthcare workers. Medical consists of the following organizational units: Medication Delivery Solutions; Medication Management Solutions; Pharmaceutical Systems; Advanced Patient Monitoring.\nLife Sciences\nLife Sciences provides products for the safe collection and transport of diagnostics specimens, and instruments and reagent systems to detect a broad range of infectious diseases, healthcare-associated infections and cancers. In addition, Life Sciences produces research and clinical tools that facilitate the study of cells, and the components of cells, to gain a better understanding of normal and disease processes. That information is used to aid the discovery and development of new drugs and vaccines, and to improve the diagnosis and management of diseases. The primary customers served by Life Sciences are hospitals, laboratories and clinics; blood banks; healthcare workers; physicians’ office practices; academic and government institutions; and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Life Sciences consists of the following organizational units: Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences.\nInterventional\nInterventional provides vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products that are intended to be used once and then discarded or are either temporarily or permanently implanted. The primary customers served by Interventional are hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities, alternate site facilities, and patients via the segment's Homecare business. Interventional consists of the following organizational units: Surgery; Peripheral Intervention; Urology and Critical Care.\nAdditional Segment Information\nDistribution of products is primarily through independent distribution channels, and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives.\nNo\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of revenues in any of the three years presented.\nSegment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting.  The Company evaluates performance of its business segments and allocates resources to them primarily based upon operating income, which represents revenues reduced by product costs and operating expenses. The Company’s chief operating decision maker does not receive any asset information by business segment and, as such, the Company does not report asset information by business segment.\nThe tables below reflect the Company’s revenues and operating income from continuing operations. Revenues and operating income from the former Diabetes Care business prior to its spin-off on April 1, 2022 are included in\n(Loss)\nIncome from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\n. See Note 2 for further information.\n84\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nFinancial information for the Company’s segments is detailed below. The Company has no material intersegment revenues.\n(a)    Represents the recognition of accruals resulting from recent developments relating to the Italian government medical device pay back legislation, as well as another legal matter, and which substantially relate to years prior to the current fiscal year. Such amounts were not allocated to the Company’s reportable segments and these matters are further discussed in Note 6.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of segment operating income to\nIncome from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes\nand segment information for both capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization.\n85\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\n(a)\nThe amounts in 2024, 2023 and 2022 include charges of $\n38\nmillion, $\n653\nmillion and $\n72\nmillion, respectively, recorded to\nCost of products sold,\nto record or adjust future costs estimated for product remediation efforts.\n(b)\nThe amount in 2022 includes a charge of $\n54\nmillion, recorded to\nCost of products sold,\nto write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit.\n(c)\nPrimarily comprised of foreign exchange, certain general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expense. The amount in 2024 includes a charge of $\n175\nmillion to accrue an estimated liability for the SEC investigation, which is further discussed in Note 6. The amount in 2023 includes a pre-tax gain recognized on the Company's sale of its Surgical Instrumentation platform of approximately $\n268\nmillion, which is further discussed in Note 2.\nGeographic Information\nThe countries in which the Company has local revenue-generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States (including Puerto Rico); EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, and Australia and New Zealand); and Other, which is comprised of Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America) and Canada.\nRevenues to unaffiliated customers are generally based upon the source of the product shipment. Long-lived assets, which include net property, plant and equipment, are based upon physical location.\n86\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe table below shows revenues from continuing operations and long-lived assets of continuing operations by geographic area:\nNote 9 —\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants share-based awards under the 2004 Employee and Director Equity-Based Compensation Plan (\"2004 Plan\"), which provides long-term incentive compensation to employees and directors consisting of: stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), performance-based restricted stock units, time-vested restricted stock units and other stock awards.\nThe fair value of share-based payments is recognized as compensation expense in net income.  BD estimates forfeitures based on experience at the time of grant and adjusts expense to reflect actual forfeiture\ns.\nThe amounts and location of compensation cost relating to share-based payments included in the consolidated statements of income is as follows:\nTotal share-based compensation expense includes pre-tax compensation expense included in\nIncome from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nthat was not material in 2022.\n87\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nStock Appreciation Rights\nSARs represent the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock having a value equal to the difference between the market price of common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price on the date of grant. SARs generally vest over a period of\nfour years\nand have a term of\nten years\n.\nThe fair value of awards was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based binomial option valuation model and these valuations were largely based upon the following weighted-average assumptions:\nExpected volatility is based upon historical volatility for the Company’s common stock and other factors. The expected life of SARs granted is derived from the output of the lattice-based model, using assumed exercise rates based on historical exercise and termination patterns, and represents the period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate used is based upon the published U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar life. The dividend yield is based upon the most recently declared quarterly dividend as of the grant date. The Company issued\n0.1\nmillion shares during 2024 to satisfy the SARs exercised.\nA summary of SARs outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and changes during the year then ended is as follows:\nA summary of SARs exercised during\n2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nPerformance-Based and Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units\nPerformance-based restricted stock units cliff vest\nthree years\nafter the date of grant. These units are tied to the Company’s performance against pre-established targets over a performance period of\nthree years\n. The performance measures for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were average annual currency-neutral revenue growth and average annual return on invested capital, with the combined factor subject to adjustment based on the Company's relative total shareholder return (measures the Company’s stock performance during the performance period against that of peer companies). Under the Company’s long-term incentive program, the\n88\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nactual payout under these awards may vary from\nzero\nto\n200\n% of an employee’s target payout, based on the Company’s actual performance over the performance period of\nthree years\n. In fiscal year 2021, the Company also issued additional performance-based time-vested units to certain key executives, a portion of which cliff vested in fiscal year 2024 based on the Company’s performance against average annual growth in the Company’s Adjusted EPS over a performance period of three years. The fair value was based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant, and compensation cost was adjusted for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of performance-related conditions.\nTime-vested restricted stock unit awards vest on a graded basis over a period of\nthree years\n, except for certain key executives of the Company, including the executive officers, for which such units generally vest\none year\nfollowing the employee’s retirement. The related share-based compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period or is based on retirement eligibility. The fair value of all time-vested restricted stock units is based on the market value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant.\nA summary of restricted stock units outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and changes during the year then ended is as follows:\n(a)\nBased on\n200\n% of target payout for performance based restricted units and\n100\n% of the performance based time-vested units.\n(b)\nNet of expected forfeited units and units in excess of the expected performance payout of\n71\nthousand and\n454\nthousand shares, respectively.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the years 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nThe total fair value of stock units vested during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nAt September 30, 2024, the weighted average remaining vesting term of performance-based and time vested restricted stock units is\n1.24\nand\n0.87\nyears, respectively.\nUnrecognized Compensation Expense and Other Stock Plans\nThe amount of unrecognized compensation expense for all non-vested share-based awards as of September 30, 2024, is approximately $\n253\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-\n89\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\naverage remaining life of approximately\n1.8\nyears. At September 30, 2024,\n10.0\nmillion shares were authorized for future grants under the 2004 Plan. The Company has a policy of satisfying share-based payments through either open market purchases or shares held in treasury. At September 30, 2024, the Company has sufficient shares held in treasury to satisfy these payments.\nAs of September 30, 2024,\n81\nthousand shares were held in trust relative to a Director's Deferral plan, which provides a means to defer director compensation, from time to time, on a deferred stock or cash basis. Also as of September 30, 2024,\n200\nthousand shares were issuable under a Deferred Compensation Plan that allows certain highly-compensated employees, including executive officers, to defer salary, annual incentive awards and certain equity-based compensation.\nNote 10 —\nBenefit Plans\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees in the United States and in certain international locations. Postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits provided to qualifying domestic retirees as well as other postretirement benefit plans in international countries are not material. The measurement date used for the Company’s employee benefit plans is September 30.\nIn August 2023, the Company announced that effective September 30, 2024, it would freeze the U.S. Plan, and plan participants, which include legacy Bard U.S. pension plan participants as further discussed below, no longer will accrue benefits under the plan subsequent to this date. Both the legacy BD U.S. pension and legacy Bard U.S. pension plans had already been frozen to prevent new participants effective January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2011, respectively.\nIn fiscal year 2022, the transfer of employees to Embecta in connection with the spin-off triggered remeasurements of some of the Company’s benefit plans. The BD U.S. pension plan was also remeasured upon the merging of this plan with the legacy Bard U.S. pension plan effective January 1, 2022. These remeasurements did not materially impact the Company’s benefit obligation and resulted in adjustments to\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n.\nGenerally, all components of the Company’s net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, aside from service cost, are recorded to\nOther expense, net\non its consolidated statements of income. Certain amounts for termination benefits, curtailments and settlements related to the spin-off of Embecta, were recorded in\nIncome from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nand were not material.\nNet pension cost for the years ended September 30 included the following components:\nThe amounts provided above for amortization of prior service credit and amortization of loss represent the reclassifications of prior service credits and net actuarial losses that were recognized in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nin prior periods. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments\n90\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nfrom the plan exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost associated with the plan for the fiscal year. The settlement losses recorded in 2023 and 2022 included lump sum benefit payments primarily associated with the Company’s U.S. pension plan. A curtailment gain was recognized in 2023 related the freeze of the U.S. pension plan.\nThe change in benefit obligation, change in fair value of pension plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these plans were as follows:\nInternational pension plan assets at fair value included in the preceding table were $\n880\nmillion and $\n748\nmillion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The international pension plan projected benefit obligations were $\n992\nmillion and $\n833\nmillion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n91\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe benefit obligation associated with postretirement healthcare and life insurance plans provided to qualifying domestic retirees, which was largely recorded to\nLong-Term Employee Benefit Obligations,\nwas\n$\n94\nmillion\nand $\n92\nmillion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nPension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of the following at September 30:\nThe weighted average assumptions used in determining pension plan information were as follows:\n(a)\nThe Company calculated the service and interest components utilizing an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve over the projected cash flow period.\n92\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, the Company considers many factors, including historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations.\nExpected Funding\nThe Company’s funding policy for its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that may be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax consequences, the cash flow generated by the Company and other factors. The Company made a discretionary contribution to its BD U.S. pension plan of $\n150\nmillion during fiscal year 2024. The Company did not make any required contributions in 2024 and does not anticipate any significant required contributions to its pension plans in fiscal year 2025.\nExpected benefit payments are as follows:\nExpected benefit payments associated with postretirement healthcare plans are immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nInvestments\nThe Company’s primary objective is to achieve returns sufficient to meet future benefit obligations. It seeks to generate above market returns by investing in more volatile asset classes such as equities while at the same time controlling risk through diversification in non-correlated asset classes and through allocations to more stable asset classes like fixed income.\nU.S. Plans\nThe Company’s U.S. pension plans comprise\n66\n% of total benefit plan investments, based on September 30, 2024 market values, and have a target asset mix of\n45\n% fixed income,\n21\n% diversifying investments and\n34\n% equities. This mix was established based on an analysis of projected benefit payments and estimates of long-term returns, volatilities and correlations for various asset classes. The asset allocations to diversifying investments include high-yield bonds, hedge funds, real estate, infrastructure, leveraged loans and emerging markets bonds.\nThe actual portfolio investment mix may, from time to time, deviate from the established target mix due to various factors such as normal market fluctuations, the reliance on estimates in connection with the determination of allocations and normal portfolio activity such as additions and withdrawals. Rebalancing of the asset portfolio on a quarterly basis is required to address any allocations that deviate from the established target allocations in excess of defined allowable ranges. The target allocations are subject to periodic review, including a review of the asset portfolio’s performance, by the named fiduciary of the plans. Any tactical deviations from the established asset mix require the approval of the named fiduciary.\nThe U.S. plans may enter into both exchange traded and non-exchange traded derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate exposure, volatility, term structure of interest rates, and sector and currency\n93\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nexposures within the fixed income portfolios. The Company has established minimum credit quality standards for counterparties in such transactions.\nThe following table provides the fair value measurements of U.S. plan assets, as well as the measurement techniques and inputs utilized to measure fair value of these assets, at September 30, 2024 and 2023. The categorization of fund investments is based upon the categorization of these funds’ underlying assets.\n(a)\nAs per applicable disclosure requirements, certain investments that were measured at net asset value per share or its equivalent have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy. Values of such assets are based on the corroborated net asset value provided by the fund administrator.\nFixed Income Securities\nU.S. pension plan assets categorized above as fixed income securities include fund investments comprised of corporate and government and agency investments. Investments in corporate bonds are diversified across industry and sector and consist of investment-grade, as well as high-yield debt instruments. U.S. government investments consist of obligations of the U.S. Treasury, other U.S. government agencies, state governments and local municipalities. Assets categorized as foreign government and agency debt securities included investments in developed and emerging markets.\nThe values of fixed income investments classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded. A portion of the fixed income instruments classified within Level 2 are valued based upon estimated prices from independent vendors’ pricing models and these prices are derived from market observable sources including: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market-related data.\nEquity Securities\nU.S. pension plan assets categorized as equity securities consist of fund investments in publicly-traded U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities. In order to achieve appropriate diversification, these portfolios are invested across market sectors, investment styles, capitalization weights and geographic regions. The values of equity securities classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the\n94\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\ninvestments are traded or have a readily determinable fair value based on published prices obtained from fund managers which represent the price at which the instruments can be redeemed at period end. The U.S. pension plan has no future funding commitments associated with these investments and has the right to redeem them upon one day’s notice, at any time and without restriction.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nA portion of the U.S. plans’ assets consists of investments in cash and cash equivalents, primarily to accommodate liquidity requirements relating to trade settlement and benefit payment activity, and the values of these assets are based upon quoted market prices.\nOther Securities\nOther U.S. pension plan assets include fund investments comprised of hedge funds. The values of such instruments classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded.\nInternational Plans\nInternational plan assets comprise\n34\n% of the Company’s total benefit plan assets, based on market value at September 30, 2024. Such plans have local independent fiduciary committees, with responsibility for development and oversight of investment policy, including asset allocation decisions. In making such decisions, consideration is given to local regulations, investment practices and funding rules.\nThe following table provides the fair value measurements of international plan assets, as well as the measurement techniques and inputs utilized to measure fair value of these assets, at September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n95\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\n(a)\nChanges in the fair value of international pension assets measured using Level 3 inputs for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were immaterial.\nFixed Income Securities\nFixed income investments held by international pension plans include corporate, U.S. government and non-U.S. government securities. The values of fixed income securities classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded. Values of investments classified within Level 2 are based upon estimated prices from independent vendors’ pricing models and these prices are derived from market observable sources.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities included in the international plan assets consist of publicly-traded U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities. The values of equity securities classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded or have a readily determinable fair value based on published prices obtained from fund managers which represent the price at which the instruments can be redeemed at period end. The international plans holding these securities have no future funding commitments associated with these investments and have the right to redeem them upon one day’s notice, at any time and without restriction.\nOther Securities\nThe international plans hold a portion of assets in cash and cash equivalents, in order to accommodate liquidity requirements and the values are based upon quoted market prices. Real estate investments consist of investments in funds holding an interest in real properties and the corresponding values represent the estimated fair value based on the fair value of the underlying investment value or cost, adjusted for any accumulated earnings or losses.  The values of insurance contracts approximately represent cash surrender value. Other investments include fund investments for which values are based upon either quoted market prices or market observable sources.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe cost of voluntary defined contribution plans which provide for a Company match or contribution was $\n195\nmillion in 2024, $\n156\nmillion in 2023 and $\n178\nmillion in 2022.\n96\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 11 —\nAcquisitions\nEdwards Lifesciences’ Critical Care Product Group\nOn September 3, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of Edwards Lifesciences’ Critical Care product group (“Critical Care”), which was renamed as BD Advanced Patient Monitoring (“Advanced Patient Monitoring”). Since the acquisition date, financial results for Advanced Patient Monitoring’s product offerings are being reported as a separate organizational unit within the Medical segment. Advanced Patient Monitoring is a global leader in advanced monitoring solutions that expands the Company’s portfolio of smart connected care solutions with its growing set of leading monitoring technologies, advanced AI-enabled clinical decision tools and robust innovation pipeline that complement the Company's existing technologies serving operating rooms and intensive care units. The Company funded the transaction with cash on hand, using net proceeds raised through debt issuances in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, as further discussed in Note 16, and borrowings under its commercial paper program. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.\nThe Company is in the process of finalizing the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, related to assessing certain assumptions underlying the valuation of intangible assets. The preliminary allocations of the purchase price provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These provisional estimates may be adjusted upon the availability of further information regarding events or circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Such adjustments may be significant. The fair value of consideration transferred in connection with the acquisition was $\n3.911\nbillion, and the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed resulted in the recognition of developed technology intangible assets of $\n714\nmillion, customer relationships intangible assets of $\n650\nmillion and $\n714\nmillion of other net assets, which are primarily inventory. The goodwill recorded from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets was $\n1.833\nbillion, which related to synergies expected to be gained from combining operations of the acquiree and acquirer, as well as revenue and cash flow projections associated with future innovative technologies expected to occur. The preliminary estimate of the goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $\n1.1\nbillion.\nThe Company included Advanced Patient Monitoring in its consolidated results of operations beginning on September 3, 2024. The Company’s unaudited pro forma\nRevenues\nfor fiscal years 2024 and 2023, giving effect as if Advanced Patient Monitoring had been acquired as of October 1, 2022, were $\n21.069\nbillion and $\n20.258\nbillion, respectively. The calculation of pro forma\nNet Income\nfor fiscal years 2024 and 2023 is not practicable because of complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.\nParata\nOn July 18, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Parata Systems (“Parata”), an innovative provider of pharmacy automation solutions. The fair value of consideration transferred was $\n1.548\nbillion. Since the acquisition date, financial results for Parata's product offerings are being reported within results for the Medical segment’s Medication Management Solutions unit. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.\nThe fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed resulted in the recognition of developed technology intangible assets of $\n628\nmillion, customer relationships intangible asset of $\n161\nmillion, and $\n1\nmillion of other net liabilities. The goodwill recorded from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets was $\n759\nmillion, which related to synergies expected to be gained from leveraging the existing presence of the Company’s sales and marketing teams in pharmacies and acute care facilities, the broader coverage of the Company’s legacy sales and marketing teams, and revenue and cash flow projections associated with future technologies. A portion of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\nIn addition to the Parata acquisition discussed above, the Company completed various other acquisitions during fiscal year 2022 which were not material individually or in the aggregate, including Parata.\n97\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 12 —\nBusiness Restructuring Charges\nThe Company incurred restructuring costs, primarily in connection with the Company's simplification and other cost saving initiatives that are part of its strategic objectives, which were largely recorded within\nIntegration, restructuring and transaction expense\non its consolidated statements of income. These simplification and other costs saving initiatives are focused on reducing complexity, enhancing product quality, refining customer experience, and improving cost efficiency across all of the Company’s segments.\nRestructuring liability activity in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\n(a)\nOther non-employee-related expenses primarily relate to other costs associated with the execution of the Company’s cost efficiency and restructuring programs, such as incremental project management costs, facility exit costs, inventory write-offs and long-lived asset impairments and disposals, which are discussed further in Note 15.\n98\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 13 —\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets at September 30 consisted of:\nIntangible amortization expense was $\n1.468\nbillion, $\n1.465\nbillion and $\n1.430\nbillion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The estimated aggregate amortization expense for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2025 to 2029 are as follows: 2025 — $\n1.551\nbillion; 2026 — $\n1.519\nbillion; 2027 — $\n1.450\nbillion; 2028 — $\n1.357\nbillion; 2029 — $\n1.264\nbillion.\nThe following is a reconciliation of goodwill by business segment:\n(a)\nRepresents goodwill derecognized upon the Company’s sale of its Surgical Instrumentation platform, as further discussed in Note 2.\n(b)\nThe purchase price allocation adjustments were primarily driven by an adjustment to tax-related balances recorded upon the finalization of the Parata acquisition allocation within one year of the transaction's closing.\n(c)\nRepresents goodwill recognized in the Medical segment upon the Company's acquisition of Advanced Patient Monitoring, which is further discussed in Note 11.\nNote 14 —\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The effects these derivative instruments and hedged items had on the Company’s balance sheets and the fair values of the derivatives outstanding at\n99\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 were not material. The effects on the Company’s financial performance and cash flows are provided below.\nForeign Currency Risks and Related Strategies\nThe Company has foreign currency exposures throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. Transactional currency exposures that arise from entering into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, in non-hyperinflationary countries that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are mitigated primarily through the use of forward contracts.\nIn order to mitigate transactional foreign currency exposures resulting from anticipated intercompany purchases and sales denominated in a currency other than local functional currencies, the Company has hedged a portion of this currency risk with certain instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges.\nIn order to mitigate foreign currency exposure relating to its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, the Company has hedged the currency risk associated with those investments with certain instruments such as foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps, which are designated as net investment hedges, as well as currency exchange contracts.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s foreign currency-related derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n(a)\nRepresents hedges of transactional foreign exchange exposures resulting primarily from intercompany payables and receivables. Gains and losses on these instruments are recognized immediately in income.  These gains and losses are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying hedged items, as well as the hedging costs associated with the derivative instruments. Net amounts recognized in\nOther expense, net\n, during the years ending September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are detailed in Note 19.\n(b)\nRepresents foreign exchange contracts that the Company entered into in fiscal year 2024 related to anticipated intercompany purchases and sales, described above, which generally have durations of less than eighteen months.\n(c)\nRepresents foreign currency-denominated long-term notes outstanding, which were effective as economic hedges of net investments in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.\n(d)\nRepresents cross-currency swaps, which were effective as economic hedges of net investments in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.\nNet gains or losses resulting from the change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded within\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nand reclassified into earnings upon the occurrence of the related underlying third-party transaction. If foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are terminated prematurely as a result of the hedged transaction being probable of not occurring, the balance in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nattributable to those derivatives is immediately reclassified into\nRevenues\nor\nCost of products sold\n(depending on whether the hedged item is an intercompany sale or purchase). Net after tax losses recognized in\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nduring 2024 were immaterial and\nno\namounts were reclassified from\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nrelating to these cash flow hedges during 2024. The amounts expected to be reclassified from accumulated other\n100\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\ncomprehensive income into earnings within the next 12 months, are not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nNet gains or losses relating to the net investment hedges, which are attributable to changes in the foreign currencies to U.S. dollar spot exchange rates, are recorded as accumulated foreign currency translation in\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n. Upon the termination of a net investment hedge, any net gain or loss included in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nrelative to the investment hedge remains until the foreign subsidiary investment is disposed of or is substantially liquidated.\nNet (losses) gains recorded to\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nrelating to the Company's net investment hedges as of September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n(a)\nThe amounts in 2024, 2023 and 2022 include net of tax gains recognized on terminated cross-currency swaps of $\n9\nmillion, $\n13\nmillion and\n$\n46\nmillion, respectively\n.\nInterest Rate Risks and Related Strategies\nThe Company uses a mix of fixed and variable rate debt, which is further discussed in Note 16, to manage its interest rate exposure, and periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage such exposures. Under these interest rate swaps, the Company exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. These swaps are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nChanges in the fair value of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk) are recorded in\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n. If interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are terminated, the balance in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nattributable to those derivatives is reclassified into earnings, within\nInterest expense\n, over the remaining life of the hedged debt. The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income relating to cash flow hedges during 2024, 2023 and 2022, as well as the amounts expected to be reclassified within the next 12 months, are not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nNet after-tax (losses) gains were recorded in\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nrelating to interest rate cash flow hedges of $(\n10\n) million, $\n23\nmillion and $\n92\nmillion in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amounts recorded during 2024 and 2022 included net after-tax gains of $\n67\nmillion and $\n41\nmillion, respectively, that were realized upon the Company’s termination of forward starting interest rate swaps.\nFor interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges (i.e., hedges against the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk), changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in market interest rates. Amounts recorded during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\n101\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s interest rate-related derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n(a)\nRepresents fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements the Company entered into to convert the interest payments on certain long-term notes from the fixed rate to a floating interest rate based on secured overnight financing rates (\"SOFR\").\n(b)\nRepresents interest rate derivatives entered into to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk related to future debt issuances.\nOther Risk Exposures\nThe Company purchases resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products. Significant increases in world oil prices that lead to increases in resin purchase costs could impact future operating results. From time to time, the Company has managed price risks associated with these commodity purchases through commodity derivative forward contracts. The Company’s commodity derivative forward contracts at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nNote 15 —\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nThe following reconciles cash and equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Company's consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023 to the total of these amounts shown on the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows:\nThe fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:\n(a)\nThese financial instruments are recorded within\nCash and equivalents\non the consolidated balance sheets. The institutional money market accounts permit daily redemption.\n(b)\nLong-term debt is recorded at amortized cost. The fair value of long-term debt is measured based upon quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments.\nShort-term investments are held to their maturities and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.  The short-term investments primarily consist of time deposits with maturities greater than\nthree months\nand less than\none year\n.\nAll other instruments measured by the Company at fair value, including derivatives, contingent consideration liabilities and available-for-sale debt securities, are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\n102\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $\n83\nmillion to\nIntegration, restructuring and transaction expense\nto write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets. In fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $\n11\nmillion to\nCost of products sold\nin the Life Sciences segment, $\n19\nmillion to\nIntegration, restructuring and transaction expense\nin the Medical segment and $\n54\nmillion to\nCost of products sold\nin the Medical segment to write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets. The amounts recognized were recorded to adjust the carrying amount of assets to the assets' fair values, which were generally estimated, based upon a market participant's perspective, using Level 3 measurements, including values estimated using the income approach.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains cash deposits in excess of government-provided insurance limits. Such cash deposits are exposed to loss in the event of nonperformance by financial institutions. Substantially all of the Company’s trade receivables are due from public and private entities involved in the healthcare industry. Due to the large size and diversity of the Company’s customer base, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited. The Company does not normally require collateral. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by financial institutions with which it conducts business. However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed the obligations of the Company. The Company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions.\nThe Company continually evaluates its accounts receivables for potential collection risks, particularly those resulting from sales to government-owned or government-supported healthcare facilities in certain countries, as payment may be dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries’ national economies. The Company continually evaluates all governmental receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices. The Company believes the current reserves related to all governmental receivables are adequate and that this concentration of credit risk will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position or liquidity.\nTransfers of trade receivables\nOver the normal course of its business activities, the Company transfers certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements. Per the terms of these agreements, the Company surrenders control over its trade receivables upon transfer. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the transfers as sales of trade receivables by recognizing an increase to\nCash and equivalents\nand a decrease to\nTrade receivables, net\nwhen proceeds from the transactions are received. The costs incurred by the Company in connection with factoring activities were not material to its consolidated financial results.\nThe amounts transferred and yet to be remitted under factoring arrangements are provided below.\nSupplier Finance Programs\nThe Company has agreements where participating suppliers are provided the ability to receive early payment of the Company’s obligations at a nominal discount through supplier finance programs entered into with third party financial institutions. The Company is not a party to these arrangements, and these programs do not impact the Company’s obligations or affect the Company’s payment terms, which generally range from\n90\n103\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nto\n150\ndays. The agreements with the financial institutions do not require the Company to provide assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees for the supplier finance programs. The Company had $\n112\nmillion and $\n94\nmillion of outstanding payables related to supplier finance programs as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were recorded within\nAccounts payable\non the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 16 —\nDebt\nCurrent debt obligations\nThe carrying value of\nCurrent debt obligations\n, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, at September 30 consisted of:\n(a)\nAll of the aggregate principal amount outstanding was retired upon maturity during 2024, as further discussed below.\nThe weighted average interest rates for current debt obligations were\n2.91\n% and\n3.43\n% at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFrom time to time, the Company may access the commercial paper market as it manages working capital over the normal course of its business activities. The Company’s U.S. and multicurrency euro commercial paper programs provide for a maximum amount of unsecured borrowings under the two programs, in aggregate, of $\n2.750\nbillion. Proceeds from these programs may be used for working capital purposes and general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, share repurchases and repayments of debt. The Company utilized commercial paper borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 to partially fund the Advanced Patient Monitoring acquisition, as further discussed in Note 11. There was $\n400\nmillion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and\nno\nsuch borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023.\n104\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nLong-term debt\nThe carrying value of\nLong-Term Debt\n, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, at September 30 consisted of:\n(a)\nRepresents notes issued during 2024, as further discussed below.\nThe aggregate annual maturities of\nLong-Term Debt\nincluding interest during the fiscal years ending September 30, 2025 to 2029 are as follows: 2025 — $\n2.824\nbillion; 2026 — $\n1.297\nbillion; 2027 — $\n3.136\nbillion; 2028 — $\n2.434\nbillion; 2029 — $\n2.581\nbillion.\n105\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nOther current credit facilities\nIn July 2024, the Company extended its\nfive-year\nsenior unsecured revolving credit facility in place by\none\n-year. The credit facility, which will expire in September 2027, provides borrowings of up to $\n2.750\nbillion, with separate sub-limits of $\n100\nmillion and $\n194\nmillion for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively. The expiration date of the credit facility may be extended for up to one additional one year period, subject to certain restrictions, including the consent of the lenders. The credit facility provides that the Company may, subject to additional commitments by lenders, request an additional $\n500\nmillion of financing, for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to $\n3.250\nbillion. Proceeds from this facility may be used for general corporate purposes and Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.à r.l. (\"Becton Finance\"), an indirect, wholly-owned finance subsidiary of BD, is authorized as an additional borrower under the credit facility. There were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, the Company has informal lines of credit outside of the United States.\nDebt issuances\nThe Company issued the following U.S. dollar-denominated debt during fiscal years 2024 and 2023:\nThe Company issued the following Euro-denominated debt during fiscal year 2024:\nAlso in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, Becton Finance issued Euro-denominated notes, listed below, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. No other of the Company's subsidiaries provide any guarantees with respect to these notes. The indenture covenants included a limitation on liens and a restriction on sale and leasebacks, change of control and consolidation, merger and sale of assets covenants. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, limitations and qualifications. The indenture does not restrict the Company, Becton Finance, or any other of the Company's subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or other liabilities, including additional senior debt.  Additionally, the indenture does\n106\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nnot restrict Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.à r.l. and the Company from granting security interests over its assets.\nThe notes issued by Becton Finance included the following:\nDebt retirements\nThe Company’s retirements of debt upon maturity in fiscal years 2024 and 2023 included the following:\nCapitalized interest\nThe Company capitalizes interest costs as a component of the cost of construction in progress.\nA summary of interest costs and payments for the years ended September 30 is as follows:\n107\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 17 —\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended September 30 consisted of:\nThe components of\nIncome from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes\nfor the years ended September 30 consisted of:\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe table below summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized benefits will change during the next twelve months due to one or more of the following events: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, other activity, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. However, the Company does not expect changes to have a significant effect on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\n108\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe following were included for the years ended September 30 as a component of\nIncome tax provision\non the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. The IRS has completed its audit for the BD legacy fiscal year 2014 and BD combined company fiscal years 2015 and 2017. With regard to legacy CareFusion, which the Company acquired in 2015, and legacy Bard, all pre-acquisition examinations have been completed. The IRS is reviewing BD’s fiscal years 2018 through 2022. For the other major tax jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, tax years are generally open after 2016.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes at September 30 consisted of:\n(a)\nAs required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company’s research and development expenditures were capitalized and amortized in fiscal year 2024 for income tax purposes. This resulted in an increase in cash tax paid in fiscal year 2024 with a corresponding deferred tax benefit.\n(b)\nNet deferred tax assets are included in\nOther Assets\nand net deferred tax liabilities are included in\nDeferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets\n.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted on the balance sheet by separate tax jurisdictions. The Company asserts indefinite reinvestment for all historical unremitted foreign earnings as of September 30, 2024. Deferred taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024 since the determination of the total amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable.\nGenerally, deferred tax assets have been established as a result of net operating losses and credit carryforwards with expiration dates from 2025 to an unlimited expiration date. Valuation allowances have been established as a result of an evaluation of the uncertainty associated with the realization of certain deferred tax assets on these losses and credit carryforwards. The valuation allowance at September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of foreign losses due to the Company’s global re-organization of its foreign entities and these generally have no expiration date. Valuation allowances are also maintained with respect to deferred tax assets for certain state carryforwards that may not be realized. The net change during the year in the total valuation allowance is attributable to foreign losses and credits.\n109\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nTax Rate Reconciliation\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate for continuing operations was as follows:\n(a)    During fiscal year 2024, the Company was granted non-U.S. tax credits, for which a full valuation allowance was established.\n(b)    Primarily related to the estimated liability recorded as a result of the SEC investigation, as further discussed in Note 6.\nTax Holidays and Payments\nThe approximate tax impacts related to tax holidays in various countries in which the Company does business are provided below. The tax holidays expire at various dates through 2039. The Company’s income tax payments, net of refunds are also provided below.\nNote 18 —\nLeases\nThe Company leases real estate, vehicles and other equipment which are used in the Company’s manufacturing, administrative and research and development activities.\nThe Company identifies a contract that contains a lease as one which conveys a right, either explicitly or implicitly, to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration. The Company’s lease arrangements are generally classified as operating leases. These arrangements have remaining terms ranging from less than\none year\nto approximately\n25\nyears and the weighted-average remaining lease term of the Company’s leases is approximately\n8.3\nyears. An option to renew or terminate the current term of a lease arrangement is included in the lease term if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\nThe Company does not recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for short-term leases, which have terms of 12 months or less, on its consolidated balance sheet.\nFor the longer-term lease arrangements that are recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, the right-of-use asset and lease liability is initially measured at the commencement date based upon the present value of the lease payments due under the lease.  These payments represent the combination of the fixed lease and fixed non-lease components that are due under the arrangement.\nThe costs associated with the Company’s short-term leases, as well as variable costs relating to the Company’s lease arrangements, are not material to its consolidated financial results.\n110\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe implicit interest rates of the Company’s lease arrangements are generally not readily determinable and as such, the Company applies an incremental borrowing rate, which is established based upon the information available at the lease commencement date, to determine the present value of lease payments due under an arrangement. The weighted-average incremental borrowing rate that has been applied to measure the Company’s lease liabilities is\n4.4\n%.\nThe Company’s lease costs recorded in its consolidated statements of income for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n190\nmillion, $\n145\nmillion and $\n138\nmillion, respectively. Cash payments arising from the Company’s lease arrangements are reflected on its consolidated statement of cash flows as outflows used for operating activities.\nThe right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nThe Company’s payments due under its operating leases are as follows:\nNote 19 —\nSupplemental Financial Information\nOther Expense, Net\n(a)\nThe amounts include gains (losses) recognized relating to certain equity investments.\n(b)\nRepresents all components of the Company’s net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, aside from service cost, including pension settlement expenses of $\n57\nmillion and $\n73\nmillion in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n111\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\n(c)\nRepresents net gains and losses from transactional foreign exchange exposures, offset by net gains and losses on undesignated foreign exchange derivatives.\n(d)\nRepresents losses recognized upon the extinguishment of certain senior notes.\n(e)\nConsists of net income from transition and logistics service agreements with Embecta following the spin-off of the former diabetes care business in fiscal year 2022, as further discussed in Note 2.\nTrade Receivables, Net\nThe amounts recognized in 2024, 2023 and 2022 relating to allowances for doubtful accounts and cash discounts, which are netted against trade receivables, are provided in the following table:\n(a)\nAccounts written off.\nInventories\nInventories at September 30 consisted of:\nThe Company acquired $\n666\nmillion of inventories in the Advanced Patient Monditoring transaction, which is further discussed in Note 11.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net at September 30 consisted of:\n112"

    "text": "An evaluation was conducted by BD’s management, with the participation of BD’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of BD’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were, as of the end of the period covered by this report, effective and designed to ensure that material information relating to BD and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within these entities.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 identified in connection with the above-referenced evaluation that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, BD’s internal control over financial reporting.\nOn September 3, 2024, BD completed the acquisition of Edwards Lifesciences’ Critical Care product group (“Critical Care”), which was renamed as BD Advanced Patient Monitoring (“Advanced Patient Monitoring”). While BD has extended its oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting, as well as its disclosure controls and procedures, we continue to integrate the acquired operations of Advanced Patient Monitoring. As such, we have excluded Advanced Patient Monitoring from our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. This exclusion is in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's general guidance that a recently acquired business may be omitted from the assessment scope for up to one year from the date of acquisition. The Advanced Patient Monitoring business had total assets that represented approximately 2% of BD's consolidated total assets at September 30, 2024 and total revenues that represented less than 1% of BD's consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2024.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm are contained in Item 8.
