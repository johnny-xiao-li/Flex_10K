We believe we are a leading:\n•\nglobal oilseed processor and producer of vegetable oils and protein meals, based on processing capacity;\n•\nglobal grain processor, based on volume;\n•\nseller of packaged plant-based oils worldwide, based on sales;\n•\nproducer and seller of wheat flours, bakery mixes, and corn-based products in North and South America, based on volume.\nWe also produce sugar and ethanol in Brazil through our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP p.l.c (\"BP\").\nWe conduct our operations via four reportable segments: Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy, organized based upon their similar economic characteristics, products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable segments and are classified as Corporate and Other.\nWe further organize these reportable segments into Core operations and Non-core operations. Core operations comprise our Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments.\nOur Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business principally involved in the purchase, storage, transportation, processing and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. Our Agribusiness operations and assets are located in North and South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, and we have merchandising and distribution offices throughout the world.\nThe Refined and Specialty Oils segment includes businesses that sell vegetable oils and fats, including cooking oils, shortenings, specialty ingredients, and renewable diesel feedstocks. The operations and assets of our Refined and Specialty Oils segment are primarily located in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nThe Milling segment includes businesses that sell wheat flours, bakery mixes, and corn-based products. The operations and assets of our Milling segment are located in North and South America. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of our wheat milling business in Mexico.\nNon-core operations comprise our Sugar and Bioenergy segment, which primarily comprises our 50% interest in the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture.\nHistory and Corporate Information\nWe trace our history back to 1818 when we were founded as a trading company in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We are a holding company and substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries.\nBunge Global is incorporated under Swiss law as a stock corporation (\nAktiengesellschaft\n) and domiciled in Geneva, Switzerland. Bunge Global is recorded in the Commercial Register of the Canton of Geneva with enterprise registration number CHE-318.451.510. Our registered office and principal executive offices are located at Route de Florissant 13, 1206 Geneva, Switzerland. Our corporate headquarters is located at 1391 Timberlake Manor Parkway, Chesterfield, Missouri, 63017, United States of America, and our telephone number is (314) 292-2000.\nRedomestication\nOn November 1, 2023, we completed the\nchange of the jurisdiction of incorporation of our group holding company from\nBermuda\nto Switzerland. The Redomestication, which was approved by our shareholders, was effected pursuant to a scheme of\n4\narrangement under Bermuda law that resulted\nin the shareholders of Bunge\nLimited\nbecoming\n, on a one-for-one basis,\nthe holders of all the issued and outstanding registered shares, par value $0.01 per share, of Bunge Global\n(the \"registered shares\").\nThe\nregistered s\nhares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") under the symbol “BG” on November 1, 2023, which is the same symbol under which the Bunge\nLimited shares\nwere previously traded.\nIn connection with the Redomestication, each of\nthe members\nof the board of directors\nof Bunge Limited who was a member of Bunge Limited’s board of directors\nimmediately prior to the Redomestication was appointed as a director of Bunge\nGlobal’s board of directors\n(the \"Board\"), and each of Bunge\nLimited’s\nexecutive officers who was an executive officer immediately prior to the Redomestication was appointed as an executive officer of Bunge Global.\nPursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), Bunge Global is the successor issuer to Bunge\nLimited\n, the registered shares are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Bunge Global is subject to the periodic and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nPending Business Combination with Viterra Limited\nOn June 13, 2023, Bunge Limited entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the \"Business Combination Agreement\") with Viterra and its shareholders, including certain affiliates of Glencore PLC (\"Glencore\"), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (\"CPP Investments\"), and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (\"BCI\") (together with Viterra, the \"Sellers\"), to acquire Viterra in a stock and cash transaction (the \"Acquisition\"). Bunge Limited shareholders approved the Acquisition at an extraordinary general meeting held on October 5, 2023.\nViterra operates a leading network of agricultural storage, processing and transport assets connecting producers to consumers with sustainable, traceable and quality-controlled agricultural products. The Acquisition is expected to create an innovative global agribusiness company well-positioned to meet the demands of increasingly complex markets and better serve farmers and end-customers.\nUnder the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Viterra shareholders are anticipated to receive approximately 65.6 million of registered shares of Bunge, with an aggregate value of approximately $6.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and receive approximately $2.0 billion in cash (collectively, the \"Transaction Consideration\"), in return for 100% of the outstanding equity of Viterra. The determination of the final value of the Transaction Consideration will depend on the Company’s share price at the time of closing. Upon completion of the transaction, the Sellers are expected to own approximately 30% of the combined Bunge company on a fully diluted basis, before giving effect to any share repurchases by Bunge occurring after June 13, 2023.\nThe Acquisition is expected to close in mid-2024, subject to the satisfaction of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The Business Combination Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties and includes certain customary termination rights. If the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in connection with certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain certain antitrust and competition clearances that are conditions to closing, Bunge would be obligated to pay the Sellers a fee of $400 million in the aggregate.\nCore Segments\nAgribusiness Segment\nOverview\n—Our Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business involved in purchasing, storing, transporting, processing, and selling agricultural commodities and commodity products while managing risk across various value chains. The principal agricultural commodities that we handle in this segment are oilseeds, primarily soybeans, rapeseed, canola, and sunflower seed, and grains, primarily wheat and corn. We process oilseeds into vegetable oils and protein meals, principally for the food, animal feed and biofuel industries, through a global network of facilities. Our footprint is well balanced, with approximately 32% of our processing capacity located in South America, 28% in North America, 24% in Europe and 16% in Asia-Pacific.\nRecent Acquisitions\n—On October 10, 2023, we entered into a definitive share purchase agreement with CJ CheilJedang Corporation and STIC CJ Global Investment Corporate Partnership Private Equity Fund to acquire 100% of outstanding equity of CJ Latam Participações Ltda. and CJ Selecta S.A. (collectively, \"CJ\"). Operations of CJ primarily consist of an oilseed processing facility located in Brazil. The acquisition is expected to close in mid-2024, subject to customary closing conditions.\nCustomers\n—We sell agricultural commodities and processed commodity products to customers throughout the world. The principal purchasers of our oilseeds, grains, and oilseed meal are animal feed manufacturers, livestock producers, wheat and corn millers, and other oilseed processors. As a result, our agribusiness operations generally benefit from global demand for protein, primarily poultry and pork products. The principal purchasers of the unrefined vegetable oils produced in this segment\n5\nare our own refined and specialty oils businesses, third-party edible oil processors, which use these oils as raw materials in the production of edible oil products for the food service, and the food processor and retail markets, as well as biofuel companies, which use the oil as feedstock for biofuel production.\nDistribution and Logistics\n—We have developed an extensive global logistics network to transport our products, including trucks, railcars, river barges, and ocean freight vessels. Typically, we either lease the transportation assets or contract with third parties for these services. To better serve our customer base and develop our global distribution and logistics capabilities, we own or operate either directly or through joint venture arrangements, various port terminal facilities, including in Brazil, Argentina, the United States, Canada, Latvia, Ukraine, France, Poland, Vietnam, and Australia.\nFinancial Services and Activities\n—We offer various financial services, principally trade structured finance and financial risk management services, to customers and other third parties. Our trade structured finance operations primarily leverage our international trade flows to generate trade finance derived liquidity in emerging markets for third parties. Our financial risk management services include structuring and marketing risk management products to enable agricultural producers and end users of commodities to manage commodity price risk exposures. We also engage in foreign exchange and other financial instrument trading via our financial services business. Additionally, we provide financing services to farmers, primarily in Brazil, from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities. Our farmer financing activities are an integral part of our grain and oilseed origination activities as they help assure the annual supply of raw materials for our Brazilian agribusiness operations.\nBiodiesel\n—We own and operate conventional biodiesel facilities in Europe and Brazil\nand have equity method investments in conventional biodiesel producers in Europe and Argentina. This business is complementary to our core Agribusiness operations as in each case we supply some of the raw materials (refined or partially refined vegetable oil) used in their production processes.\nRaw Materials\n—We purchase oilseeds and grains either directly from farmers or indirectly through intermediaries. Although the availability and price of agricultural commodities may, in any given year, be affected by unpredictable factors such as weather, government programs and policies, and farmer planting and selling decisions, our operations in major crop growing regions have enabled us to source adequate raw materials for our operational needs.\nCompetition\n—Due to their commodity nature, markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to product substitution. Competition is principally based on price, quality, product and service offerings, and geographic location. Major competitors include but are not limited to: Archer Daniels Midland Co. (\"ADM\"), Cargill Incorporated (\"Cargill\"), Louis Dreyfus Group (\"Louis Dreyfus\"), Glencore, Wilmar International Limited (\"Wilmar\"), and COFCO International (\"COFCO\").\nRefined and Specialty Oils Segment\nOverview\n—We primarily sell our refined and specialty oil products to food processors, food service companies, renewable diesel producers, and retail outlets. The principal raw materials used in our Refined and Specialty Oils segment are various crude and further processed vegetable oils and fats. These raw materials are mostly agricultural commodities that we either produce or purchase from third parties. We believe that our global integrated business model enables us to realize synergies among our Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments through raw material procurement, logistics, risk management and the co-location of industrial facilities, enabling us to supply customers with reliable, high-quality products on a global basis. As many of the products we sell in our Refined and Specialty Oils segment are staple foods or ingredients, these businesses generally benefit from global population and income growth rates. Additionally, our businesses that sell vegetable oils as feedstock to the renewable diesel industry generally benefit from increased emphasis on environmental sustainability, including government incentives and mandates aimed at increasing the percentage of fuels stemming from renewable sources, and increased production from the renewable diesel industry.\nRecent Acquisitions\n—In April 2023, Bunge, through our 80% ownership of the Bunge Loders Croklaan (\"Loders\") joint venture with IOI Corporation Berhad, completed our purchase of a port-based refinery located in Avondale, Louisiana in the United States. The facility has multi-oil refining capabilities and provides a scalable, complementary addition to our North America footprint.\nProducts\n—Our refined and specialty oil products include packaged and bulk oils and fats, including cooking oils, shortenings, margarines, mayonnaise, renewable diesel feedstocks, and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process. We primarily use soybean, sunflower, rapeseed, and canola oil that we produce in our Agribusiness segment processing operations as raw materials in this business. We also refine and fractionate palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and shea butter, and blend and refine olive oil. Additionally, we produce specialty ingredients derived from vegetable oils, such as lecithin, which is used as an emulsifier in a broad range of food products. We are a leading seller of packaged vegetable oils\n6\nworldwide, based on sales. We have refined and specialty oils refining and packaging facilities in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. Our refined and specialty oils business comprises our wholly-owned refined oils business in North America, other business to business (\"B2B\") and business to consumer (\"B2C\") refined and specialty oils offerings in South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, and our 80% ownership interest in our Loders joint venture with IOI Corporation Berhad.\nIn Brazil, our retail edible oil brands include\nSoya\n, the leading consumer packaged vegetable oil brand, as well as\nPrimor, Leve,\nand\nSalada\n. Further, we are a leading supplier of shortenings to the food processor market.\nIn the United States and Canada, we primarily provide product offerings to food processors and food service companies, and we sell refined vegetable oils as feedstock to the renewable diesel industry. Specifically, we offer food manufacturers, bakeries, confectionaries, and food service operators high-quality solutions to fit their goals, such as delivering desired tastes and textures, or reducing saturated fats in their products. Our products include trans-fat free high-oleic canola oil, which is low in saturated fats, and high-oleic soybean oil, which is highly stable and trans-fat free. We have also developed proprietary fiber addition processes that allow bakery and food processor customers to achieve significant saturated fat reductions in shortenings. We also produce margarines and buttery spreads, including our leading\nCountry Premium\nbrand, for food service, food processor and retail private label customers.\nIn Europe, we are a leader in consumer packaged vegetable oils, which are sold in various geographies under brand names including\nVenusz\n,\nFloriol\n,\nKujawski\n,\nUnisol, Kaliakra\n,\nOleina\n,\nOliwier\n,\nKomili and Kirlangic.\nWe are also a leader in margarines, under brand names including\nSmakowita, Slynne, Maslo Rosline, Masmix, Optima, Finuu, Deli Reform, Keiju, Alentaia, Venusz, Evesol, Carlshamn, Voimix, and Eleplant.\nAdditionally, we produce a variety of products for the confectionery and bakery industries. We are also an oils supplier in the Western European food service channel.\nIn Asia, we offer a range of consumer products and offerings, including bakery, culinary, confectionary, and human nutrition products. In India, our consumer brands include\nDalda\n,\nGagan, Fiona\nand\nChambal\nedible oils;\nDalda\nand\nGagan\nvanaspatis; and\nMasterline\nprofessional bakery fats. In China, we offer consumer edible oils products under the\nDou Wei Jia, Jia Run, Bang Yan,\nand\nJia Yan\nbrands.\nCustomers\n—Our customers include baked goods companies, snack food producers, confectioners, restaurant chains, food service operators, human nutrition companies, other food manufacturers who use vegetable oils and shortenings as ingredients in their operations, and renewable diesel producers. Other customers include grocery chains, wholesalers, distributors, and other retailers who sell to consumers either under our own brand names or private labels. These customers include global and national food processors and manufacturers, many of which are leading brand owners in their product categories.\nCompetition\n—Competition is based on a number of factors, including price, raw material procurement, distribution capability, cost structure, brand recognition, product quality, product innovation, technical support, composition and nutritional value, and advertising and promotion. Our products may compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label and customized products. Our principal competitors in the Refined and Specialty Oils segment include, but are not limited to: ADM, AAK AB, Cargill, Fuji Oil Co. Ltd., and Wilmar, as well as local competitors in each region.\nMilling Segment\nOverview\n—We primarily sell our milling products to three customer types or market channels: food processors, food service companies, and retail outlets. The principal raw materials used in our milling businesses are wheat, corn, and other agricultural commodities sourced from our Agribusiness segment or directly from third parties. Similar to our refined and specialty oils business, we realize synergies among our other segments in areas such as raw material procurement, logistics, risk management, and the co-location of industrial facilities, enabling us to supply customers with reliable, high quality products on a global basis. As many of the products we sell in our Milling segment are staple foods or ingredients, these businesses generally benefit from macro population and income growth rates. Additionally, our Milling segment is focused on capitalizing on growing global consumer food trends, including a desire for less processed, healthier foods, interest in new flavors, and increases in snacking and eating outside the home.\nProducts\n—Our Milling segment activities include the production and sale of a variety of wheat flours and bakery mixes in Brazil, as well as corn-based products derived from both the dry and wet corn milling processes in the United States and Mexico. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of our wheat milling business in Mexico.\nOur brands in Brazil include\nSuprema, Soberana, Farina,\nand\nPredileta\nwheat flours,\nPre-Mescla\nand\nBTX\nbakery premixes. Our corn milling products primarily consist of dry-milled corn meals and flours, flaking and brewers' grits, soy-\n7\nfortified corn meal, corn-soy blends, snack grits and meals, and other similar products. As part of our corn portfolio, we also sell whole grain and fiber ingredients in addition to wet-milled masa flours, some sold under the\nEl Maizal\nbrand in the United States. Additionally, we offer non-GMO products in the United States, including corn varieties.\nCustomers\n—The primary customers for our wheat milling products are food processing, bakery, and food service companies. The primary customers for our corn milling products are companies in the food-processing sector, such as cereal, snack, bakery, brewing, and food service companies, as well as the U.S. Government under its humanitarian assistance programs.\nCompetition\n—Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, raw material procurement, brand recognition, product quality, nutritional profile, dietary trends, and distribution capabilities. In Brazil, our major competitors are M. Dias Branco, J. Macedo, Moinho Anaconda, and Grande Moinho Cearense, as well as many small regional producers. Our major competitors in North American corn milling include Cargill, Didion Inc., SEMO Milling, LLC, Life Line Foods, LLC, and Gruma S.A.B. de C.V.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to our individual reporting segments because the operating performance of such reporting segments is evaluated by our chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.\nNon-core Segment\nSugar and Bioenergy Segment\nOur Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily comprises our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, our joint venture with BP, as well as minor ethanol distribution sales activity. BP Bunge Bioenergia operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North, and Midwest regions of Brazil. BP Bunge Bioenergia is the second largest operator by effective crushing capacity in the Brazilian sugarcane ethanol biofuel industry. We account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our reported Sugar and Bioenergy results include our share of the net earnings in BP Bunge Bioenergia. While we are committed to supporting the growth and development of BP Bunge Bioenergia, our long-term goal is to seek strategic opportunities for our investment in the joint venture, hence the designation of such operations as Non-core.\nThe formation of BP Bunge Bioenergia combined our eight mills, the plantations we owned and managed, and related assets, together with BP’s sugar and bioenergy business in Brazil, which included three mills and related assets. BP Bunge Bioenergia's combined mills are supplied with sugarcane grown on approximately 460,000 hectares of land. In 2023, approximately 77% of the joint venture's total milled sugarcane came from plantations owned or managed by BP Bunge Bioenergia and 23% was purchased from third-party suppliers. These mills allow BP Bunge Bioenergia to produce sugar, ethanol and electricity, as further described below.\n•\nSugar-BP Bunge Bioenergia produces two types of sugar: very high polarity (\"VHP\") raw sugar and crystal sugar. VHP sugar is similar to the raw sugar traded on major commodities exchanges, including the standard NY11 contract, and is sold almost exclusively for export. Crystal sugar is a non-refined white sugar and is principally sold domestically in Brazil.\n•\nEthanol-BP Bunge Bioenergia produces and sells two types of ethanol: hydrous and anhydrous. Hydrous ethanol is consumed directly as a transport fuel, and as industrial grade for exports. Anhydrous ethanol is blended with gasoline in transport fuels.\n•\nElectricity-BP Bunge Bioenergia generates electricity from burning sugarcane bagasse in its mills.\nThe sugar produced at BP Bunge Bioenergia’s mills is sold in both the Brazilian domestic market, primarily in the confectionary and food processing industries, and export markets. The ethanol is sold primarily to customers for use in the Brazilian domestic market to meet demand for fuel, and also exported in the international market. BP Bunge Bioenergia competes with other sugar and ethanol producers both in Brazil and internationally, along with beet sugar processors and producers of other sweeteners and biofuels in the global market. Major competitors in Brazil include Cosan Limited/Raizen, São Martinho S.A., and Biosev (a subsidiary of Louis Dreyfus). Major international competitors include British Sugar PLC, Südzucker AG, Cargill, Tereos S.A., Sucden S.A., ED&F Man Limited, and COFCO.\n8\nRisk Management\nRisk management is a fundamental aspect of our business. We maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to support the achievement of our strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value. We regularly review our enterprise level risks, emerging risks and assess our risk tolerance levels and the effectiveness of our risk monitoring and risk management efforts. Our Board has established the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (\"ERMC\") to provide greater focus at the Board level on risk oversight tailored to our business and industries. Additionally, each of our other Board committees considers risks within its area of responsibility. Bunge also has a Management Risk Committee (\"MRC\") in its enterprise risk management (\"ERM\") framework, responsible for reviewing and monitoring key exposures, emerging risks, and drivers of risk. The risks covered by the MRC include but are not limited to commodity price risk; market risk; liquidity, interest rate, and financing risk; credit and counterparty risk; country risk; cybersecurity risk; and risks related to climate change. When considering these risks, three criteria are evaluated: the possibility of occurrence, magnitude of risk, and power to mitigate. These risks are directly linked to the substantive impact understood by Bunge, which include but are not limited to the impact related to the potential loss of customer demand for our products or the ability to supply products in sufficient volumes to meet demand. The MRC serves as the most senior management-level risk governance body and includes senior leaders across the organization, including our Chief Risk Officer (\"CRO\").\nThe primary risks that our company is subject to are discussed under the heading \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and we also describe our efforts to hedge and actively manage our market risks, including those associated with our positions in physical and derivative markets for agricultural commodities, energy, inland and ocean freight, foreign currency, and interest rates under the heading \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nInsurance\nIn each country in which we conduct business, our operations and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. We financially insure our businesses and assets in each country in a manner that we deem appropriate for a company of our size and activities, including against certain risks associated with the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, based on an analysis of the relative risks, costs, and market availability of insurance. We believe that our geographic dispersion of assets helps mitigate the risk to our business from an adverse event affecting a specific facility. However, if we were to incur a significant loss or liability for which we were not insured in full or in part, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOperating Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe have included financial information about our reportable segments and our operations by geographic area in\nNote 27- Segment Information\nto our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and Development, Innovation, Patents, and Licenses\nOur research and development activities are focused on developing products and improving processes that will drive growth or otherwise add value to our core business operations and create value for our customers. In our refined and specialty oils and milling businesses, we have several research and development centers globally to support product development and enhancement, working alongside our key customers. We monitor the latest advancements in our core areas via an external technology scouting program. Additionally, Bunge Ventures, our corporate venture capital unit, invests in start-ups and other early-stage companies that are developing new technologies relevant to our industries. Additionally, we invest capital and human resources in digital innovations, aimed at using technology, data and analytics to improve how we perform our most important functions across our value chains, including origination, production, logistics, and customer experience.\nWe own trademarks, patents, and licenses covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes. However, neither our business as a whole nor any segment is dependent on any specific trademark, patent, or license.\nSeasonality\nIn our Agribusiness segment, while there is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of our principal raw materials, such as oilseeds and grains, we typically do not experience material fluctuations in volume between the first and second half of the year, since we are geographically diversified between the northern and southern hemispheres, and we sell and distribute products throughout the year. However, the first quarter of the year has generally been our weakest in terms of financial results due to the timing of the North and South American oilseed harvests, as the North American harvest peaks in the third and fourth quarters, and the South American harvest peaks in the second quarter. Our North and South American grain merchandising and oilseed processing activities are, therefore, generally at lower levels during the first quarter.\nIn our Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments, demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays and other annual events.\n9\nGovernment Regulation\nIn each of the countries in which we operate, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business, including general business regulations as well as those governing the manufacturing, production, handling, storage, transport, marketing, and sale of our products. These include laws and regulations relating to facility licensing and permitting, food, and feed safety, the handling and production of regulated substances, nutritional and labeling requirements, global trade compliance and other matters. Our operations and those of our suppliers are also subject to restrictions on land use in certain protected areas, forestry reserve requirements, limitations on water use, as well as other environmental regulations. Additionally, from time-to-time, agricultural production shortfalls in certain regions, and growing demand for agricultural commodities for feed, food, and fuel use have caused prices for relevant agricultural commodities to rise. High commodity prices and regional crop shortfalls have led, and in the future may lead, governments to impose price controls, tariffs, export restrictions and other measures designed to ensure adequate domestic supplies and/or mitigate price increases in their domestic markets, as well as increase the scrutiny of competitive conditions in their markets.\nMany countries use and produce biofuels as alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Biofuels convert crops, such as sugarcane, corn, soybeans, palm, rapeseed, canola, and other oilseeds, into ethanol, renewable diesel, or biodiesel to extend, enhance or substitute for fossil fuels. Production of biofuels has increased significantly in the last decade in response to both periods of high fossil fuel prices and to government incentives to produce biofuels offered in many countries, including the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and several South-East Asian and European countries. Furthermore, in several countries, governmental authorities are mandating biofuel use in transport fuels at specified levels. As such, the markets for agricultural commodities used in the production of biofuels have become increasingly affected by the growth of the biofuels industry and related legislation.\nWe are subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, and we incur costs to comply with these requirements. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental matters has not had a material financial or competitive effect on our business. However, due to our extensive operations across multiple industries and jurisdictions globally, we are exposed to the risk of claims and liabilities under these laws and regulations. Violations can result in substantial fines, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, revocations of operating permits and/or shutdowns of our facilities, litigation, other liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation.\nOur business could also be affected by the regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions, policies related to national emission reduction plans, and regulations related to conservation and eliminating deforestation. A number of jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce GHG emissions or deforestation, including, but not limited to, the Unites States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, and China. For example, the Biden Administration has issued a series of executive orders and regulatory initiatives focused on climate change, including rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, pursuant to which the Administration has announced a goal of reducing U.S. GHG emissions by one-half by 2030. In addition, the European Union Deforestation Regulation (\"EUDR\"), which is scheduled to become effective in December 2024, will require companies trading in certain commodities, including oil palm and soy, as well as products derived from these commodities, to ensure these commodities and related products do not result from deforestation, forest degradation, or breaches of local laws after December 31, 2020 in order to sell such products in the European Union. We are in the process of assessing the impact of the EUDR on Bunge. Our operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet related existing obligations with, at this time, no significant impact on our results of operations and competitive position. We regularly assess the potential impacts to our business resulting from regulation or policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions and deforestation. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and additional investments to modify our facilities, equipment and processes.\nAs regulators increasingly focus on climate change and other sustainability issues, we expect to become subject to new environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") disclosure frameworks. Additionally, as a result of our Redomestication to Switzerland, we may also become subject to more scrutiny by investors and other stakeholders in Europe related to our ESG disclosures, the actions we are taking and the goals we set.\nWe closely monitor the rules and regulations related to ESG disclosure and their impact on us. For example, in November 2022, the European Union adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (\"CSRD\"), which expands the number of companies required to publicly report ESG-related information and defines the ESG-related information that companies are required to report in accordance with European Sustainability Reporting Standards (\"ESRS\"). While CSRD rules are prescriptive for the types of data to be reported, the standards to quantify and qualify such data are still evolving and uncertain, and may impose increased costs on us related to complying with our reporting obligations and increase risks of non-compliance with ESRS and the CSRD. We are currently evaluating the impact of the CSRD reporting requirements to Bunge and will comply with all applicable in-scope CSRD reporting requirements.\n10\nAs a Swiss corporation, Bunge is also required under Swiss law to prepare a report covering certain non-financial matters, including environmental matters (in particular the carbon reduction goals), social issues, employee-related issues, respect for human rights, and combating corruption. The report must include (i) a description of our business model, (ii) a description of the policies adopted in relation to these matters, including the due diligence applied, (iii) a presentation of the measures taken to implement these policies and an assessment of the effectiveness of these measures, (iv) a description of the main risks related to these matters and how we are dealing with these risks, and (v) the main performance indicators for the Company’s activities in relation to these matters. We will be required to submit the report to our shareholders for approval at the 2024 Annual Meeting, with respect to our 2023 fiscal year. In addition,\nu\nnder Switzerland’s legislation regarding the due diligence and transparency in relation to child labor in the supply chain, we are required to establish (1) a supply chain policy on child labor, (2) a supply chain traceability system that includes and documents for each product or service for which there are reasonable grounds to suspect child labor (a) a description of the product or service and (b) the trade name and the names and addresses of the supplier and the production sites or the service provider for the undertaking, (3) as an early warning mechanism for risk identification, a reporting procedure that allows interested parties to raise reasonable concerns about the existence of a potential or actual adverse impact related to child labor, and (4) a risk management plan which identifies and assesses the risks in the supply chain according to the likelihood of occurrence and severity of adverse impacts and eliminates, prevents or minimizes such risks on that basis. We will be required to publish a report regarding compliance with our child labor due diligence obligations with respect to our 2023 fiscal year by June 30, 2024.\nFurther, on October 7, 2023, California enacted the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act and the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (together, the \"Climate Accountability Package\"). The Climate Accountability Package requires, among other things, all private and public companies with an annual revenue of more than $1 billion and doing business in California to publicly disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions beginning in 2026 and Scope 3 GHG emissions in 2027.\nAlthough, at this time, it is not possible to estimate the likelihood of passage or predict the potential impact of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements, the effects of additional climate change regulatory initiatives could have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The scope of physical effects of climate change, including shifts in agricultural production areas and climatic volatility, is uncertain, but could in the long-term result in increased adverse incidents of weather-related events that cause disruptions to our operations and may ultimately result in stranded physical assets. We currently believe the breadth and diversification of our global asset network, as well as our participation in the global trade of agricultural commodities, will help to mitigate these risks.\nAdditionally, in response to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, the United States, other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (\"NATO\") member states, as well as non-NATO member states, have announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia and Belarus, certain Russian and Belarusian citizens, and Russian and Belarusian enterprises. Any escalation of the war may trigger additional economic and other sanctions. On September 16, 2022, Bunge signed an agreement to sell its remaining Russian operations, primarily comprising an oilseed crushing and refining facility in Voronezh, southwest Russia, to Karen Vanetsyan. On February 3, 2023, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the agreement and the sale was completed. As of the completion of the sale, Bunge no longer maintains operations in Russia.\nSustainability\nBunge believes sustainability is critical to our business. While we have consistently incorporated ESG factors into Bunge’s strategy and operations, we have intensified our efforts in light of new consumer trends, risks arising from factors such as climate change, and the emerging commercial opportunities in the low carbon market. We integrate ESG factors into nearly every area of our business, from how we evaluate new growth markets, plan and develop our strategic goals, compensate our employees and operate our facilities, to how we engage with our customers, suppliers, employees, communities, shareholders and other stakeholders. We encourage Bunge leadership around the globe to embrace sustainable decision-making across our value chains built on a foundation of ethical leadership, accountability and environmental stewardship. Our key areas of growth, comprising expansion of our oilseed processing and origination capabilities, production of renewable feedstocks, increasing our plant lipids portfolio and development of new plant-based protein ingredients, are not only core to our business strategy but also a testament to the alignment of sustainability with our corporate vision.\nA key feature of our sustainability strategy is to leverage Bunge’s position in the value chain and its experience delivering sustainable solutions to stakeholders in order to collaboratively promote industry-wide transformation. Bunge has been a founder and active member of leading industry associations and platforms to find practical solutions to certain sustainability challenges, such as climate change, land use change, human rights and biodiversity. We are committed to eliminating native vegetation conversion associated with agricultural commodity production and trade in 2025 – a commitment that was established in 2015 and serves as a guide for sector alignment. We intend to build on our shared efforts, working with governments, farmers, and other key stakeholders in our supply chains, to identify opportunities for public-private collaboration focused on eliminating commodity-driven deforestation.\n11\nBunge’s public reporting on ESG conforms with internationally recognized frameworks and standards, the details of which are captured in the annual corporate sustainability reports published in the first half of each year. The 2024 sustainability report will contain further information on Bunge’s ESG strategy, performance, and other disclosures. In addition, as described above, as a Swiss corporation, Bunge is also required under Swiss law to establish an annual non-financial matter report covering, among other things, certain ESG matters (which will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the 2024 Annual Meeting), and to publish a report on our due diligence in the upstream supply chain to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for child labor. Such reports are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report.\nGovernance\nSustainability considerations, including climate change, deforestation and native vegetation conversion, water use, biodiversity, human rights, social development, community impact, stakeholder engagement, and more, are embedded across the functions of multiple committees of Bunge’s Board.\nThe Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee (\"SCRC\") of the Board oversees sustainability strategy at Bunge. The SCRC meets on a regular basis and is tasked with oversight of governance, policies, strategies and programs related to a comprehensive set of sustainability and corporate social responsibility factors that support the sustainable growth of the Company, including, but not limited to, climate change, environmental matters, human rights, social development, risk management, external trends, external stakeholder engagement, philanthropy, and reporting and disclosure. Additionally, the ERMC of the Board periodically evaluates climate related risks and opportunities in connection with its oversight of enterprise risks and risk mitigation strategies. The Audit Committee periodically evaluates applicable trends, risks, and developments in non-financial reporting practices and requirements that may impact the Company’s regulatory filings, including ESG-related disclosures. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee (\"HRCC\") oversees the establishment of sustainability linked performance goals for our executives and workforce.\nThe sustainability function is executed by the Chief Sustainability Officer (\"CSO\"), who reports to our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). The CSO leads a global team operating across multiple geographies and functions that regularly engage business leadership to ensure company-wide alignment with sustainability objectives and opportunities.\nStrategy\nWe leverage our leadership, extensive knowledge of the industry, and our deeply rooted relationships with customers at both ends of the value chain to address the sustainability challenges facing the food, feed, and fuel supply chains in which we operate. We intend to address those challenges by, among other things, connecting farmers and our end customers as they seek to establish common approaches to overcome shared sustainability challenges. This means that the decisions we make — from strategy to investments to operations — look at the associated GHG impact and how it will shape our long-term climate ambitions. With a sustainability mindset, we can enhance our focus on decarbonization in both our operations and in our supply chains, continue providing low carbon solutions to our food, feed, and fuel customers, and ensuring climate-related risks are deeply embedded into our governance framework. We have a proud history of accomplishment that we are building on to realize our approach.  For example, Bunge is actively engaged in supplying low carbon feedstock for renewable fuels, sourcing and supplying grains planted under regenerative agricultural practices, and supplying certified and verified deforestation-free grains and by-products, among other initiatives. These business objectives are a natural extension of our sustainability efforts and have been partly developed by applying a “climate lens” to our strategic decision-making.\nRisk Management\nIn 2021, Bunge began implementing enhancements to its ERM framework by incorporating more detailed sustainability risks and opportunities into the ERM process. These include risks emanating from changing climate and weather patterns, water scarcity, deforestation, human rights, farmer productivity, and increasing taxation and regulation on GHG emissions. This process was further enhanced in 2022 by adding risk factors into the ERM framework. The ERM process provides Bunge with greater oversight and management of climate-related risks and the potential financial implications, and will help ensure continued short-, medium- and long-term resilience.\nClimate risks are overseen at the Board level by the ERMC, which has responsibility for supervising the quality and integrity of our risk management practices. Enterprise risk management is overseen at the executive level by the CRO, who reports to our CEO, with input from relevant teams and functions. Further, as noted above the MRC reviews climate related risks, such as adverse weather patterns, current or emerging regulations, reputational hazards, and other sources which are included in this process. The results of these assessments are distributed throughout the executive leadership team and to the Board, and provided to key stakeholders in annual risk reports. In recent years, new climate risk factors were incorporated into the MRC's assessment process. These data points are in addition to dozens of other sustainability-related factors that are assessed by the MRC and communicated to the ERMC.\n12\nMetrics and Targets\nWhen setting public commitments, particularly quantifiable targets on GHG emissions and related measures, Bunge’s leadership and employees regularly engage with stakeholders, review market and consumer trends, and consider business risks and opportunities. Where feasible, Bunge also engages in sector-wide discussions to align with value chain partners so that metrics and targets are aligned for maximum impact and transformation.\nBunge established Science Based Targets (\"SBTs\") in 2021, which were verified by the SBTi and cover absolute reductions in GHG emissions across all three Scopes. From a 2020 baseline to a 2030 deadline, the targets call for:\n•\nScopes 1 & 2 - Absolute reduction of 25%\n•\nScope 3 - Absolute reduction of 12.3%\nDue to the nature of Bunge’s business and operations, the vast majority of GHG emissions are found within the value chain (Scope 3), particularly upstream sources. Therefore, a substantial portion of Bunge’s emissions reduction will be achieved by meeting the Company’s 2025 non-deforestation commitment. Additional emissions reduction activities to meet the SBTs include enhancements to the Company’s plants, procurement of zero- or low-carbon electricity sources, and the uptake of certified products and regenerative farming practices.\nAdditional metrics and targets include intensity reductions by 2026 from a 2016 baseline for water (10% overall and 25% for facilities located in areas of high water stress), waste (10% disposal), and energy (10% consumption).\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 23,000 people. Many of our employees are represented by labor unions and their employment is governed by collective bargaining agreements. In general, we consider our employee relations to be good.\nOur People\nWe care about our people. We listen, empower, develop and reward them with the goal of driving high levels of engagement and commitment to Bunge. From hiring the best talent to inclusion and belonging initiatives, career development, total employee rewards, and wellness, Bunge strives to create programs and resources that enhance our workplace environment.\nTalent Acquisition\nAt Bunge, we aim to attract the best talent to ensure a sustainable pipeline of talent needed for today and in the future. We continue to focus on diversity of external hires to meet our overall workforce composition targets, using tools and partnerships to enable a diverse and competitive candidate pool.\nInclusion & Belonging\nWe value inclusion and respect the unique viewpoints our employees bring to make Bunge a dynamic and innovative company. As a global organization, we have a workforce with a wide variety of skill sets and backgrounds critical to meeting the changing needs of a growing world. Strongly guided by our values, the expertise of our teams is a competitive advantage in connecting with thousands of people around the globe to serve our purpose to deliver essential food, feed, and fuel. We are committed to supporting our communities and strengthening our efforts to ensure our workforce, programs, and practices enhance our culture of belonging.\nCareer & Development\nWe focus on training and development that helps employees develop the skills they need both today and in the future. One of the greatest drivers of growth for our people is their own initiative and sense of career ownership. We encourage employees to create individual development plans and provide employees access to apply for internal career opportunities that match their interests and skills.\n13\nSafety\nOur care and concern for people and their families is rooted in always Doing What's Right when it comes to safety. We believe everyone has the right to a safe work environment. Our approach focuses on incident prevention and mitigation, and we are committed to learning and improving through demonstrated safety leadership at all levels.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.bunge.com.

    "text": "Risk Factors\nOur business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our financial condition and business operations. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements.\"\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industries\nAdverse weather conditions, including as a result of climate change, may adversely affect the availability, quality and price of agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products, as well as our operations, supply chains, and operating results.\nAdverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, reduce demand for our fertilizer products, and negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us.\nSevere adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes and severe storms, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries, and other loss and damage to us. Our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services, including transportation by ocean vessel, river barges, rail, and truck. A disruption in transportation services as a result of weather conditions, such as low river levels following periods of drought, may also have a significant adverse impact on our operations and related supply chains.\nAdditionally, the potential physical impacts of climate change are uncertain and may vary by region. These potential effects could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, shifts in agricultural production areas, changing temperature levels, increased frequency or severity of extreme weather events, and climatic volatility. The frequency and severity of the effects of climate change or weather patterns could increase and adversely impact our business operations, the location, costs and competitiveness of global agricultural commodity production and related storage and processing facilities, as well as the supply and demand for agricultural commodities, and may result in incidents of stranded physical assets. These effects could be material to our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nThe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe maintain operations in Ukraine. Ukraine forms part of a key international grain originating region and is also the world’s largest supplier of sunflower seed and sunflower oil, commodities that cannot be completely replaced from other origins. On February 24, 2022, Russia initiated a military offensive in Ukraine. Bunge’s Ukrainian operations comprise two oilseed crushing facilities, located in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk, a grain export terminal in the Mykolaiv commercial seaport, numerous grain elevators, and an office in Kiev. The Company also operates a corn milling facility in Ukraine via a joint venture. Assets and operations located in regions affected by the war are at a heightened risk of property damage, inventory loss, business disruption, and expropriation. On July 17, 2023, an agreement allowing the safe export of grain from three Ukrainian ports (Pivdennyi/Yuzhnvi, Odesa, and Chornomorsk; the “POC corridor”) on the Black Sea expired. Following the termination of the POC corridor agreement, Russian attacks on key Ukrainian export infrastructure locations intensified. As of the date of this Annual Report, the termination of the POC corridor agreement and recent Russian attacks on key export infrastructure have not significantly impacted Bunge’s results of operations in Ukraine as alternative routes to export product are being effectively utilized, however, in the event Bunge is unable to utilize alternative routes effectively, Bunge’s results of operations in Ukraine may be adversely affected. Further, no material damage has been noted at any of Bunge’s Ukrainian facilities, however, due to safety concerns, it is not always possible to conduct onsite physical inspections of our Ukrainian facilities to understand the full extent of the impact of the war. As of December 31, 2023, total assets and total liabilities associated with Bunge's Ukrainian subsidiaries each comprise less than 3% of our consolidated Total assets and Total liabilities, respectively.\nOur Ukrainian operations employ approximately 1,000 employees. While as of the date of this Annual Report some of our Ukrainian employees have been forced to relocate to other areas within Ukraine or to other countries, our workforce remains largely intact. The ongoing war could cause harm to our employees and otherwise impair their ability to work for extended periods of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Disruption to the power grid,\n16\ntransportation routes, telecommunications systems, banks, and other critical infrastructure necessary to conduct business in Ukraine could also severely impair our Ukrainian operations. The scope, intensity, duration and outcome of the ongoing war is uncertain, and the continuation or escalation of the war may have a material adverse effect on Bunge’s assets, operations and financial condition.\nIn response to the war, the United States, other NATO member states, as well as non-NATO member states, have announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia and Belarus, certain Russian and Belarusian citizens, and Russian and Belarusian enterprises. Any escalation of the war may trigger additional economic and other sanctions. On September 16, 2022, Bunge signed an agreement to sell its remaining Russian operations, primarily comprising an oilseed crushing and refining facility in Voronezh, southwest Russia, to Karen Vanetsyan. On February 3, 2023, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the agreement and the sale was completed. As of the completion of the sale, Bunge no longer maintains operations in Russia.\nIn addition, the risk of cybersecurity incidents has increased in connection with the ongoing war, driven by justifications such as retaliation for the sanctions imposed in conjunction with the war, or in response to certain companies' continued operations in Russia. See \"—\nOur information technology systems, processes and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches or failures that may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\n\"\nAlthough we insure ourselves against many types of risks, including certain risks associated with the ongoing war, our level of insurance may not cover all losses we could incur. There could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are not able to adequately insure against the possible exposure we could experience as a result of the war. To the extent the current war adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Item 1A, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Due to the continuously evolving nature of the war, the potential impact that the war could have on these risk factors, and others that cannot yet be identified, remains uncertain. Even if the war moderates, or a resolution between Ukraine and Russia is reached, we expect that we will continue to experience ongoing financial and operational impacts resulting from the war for the foreseeable future as Ukraine rebuilds its economy and infrastructure.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in agricultural commodity and other raw material prices, energy prices, and other factors outside of our control that could adversely affect our operating results.\nPrices for agricultural commodities and their by-products, including, among others, soybeans, corn, wheat, sugar and ethanol, like those of other commodities, are often volatile and sensitive to local and international changes in supply and demand caused by factors outside of our control, including farmer planting and selling decisions, currency fluctuations, inflation, government agriculture programs and policies, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), governmental restrictions or mandates, global inventory levels, demand for biofuels, weather and crop conditions, and demand for and supply of competing commodities and substitutes. These factors may cause volatility in our operating results.\nAdditionally, our operating costs and the selling prices of certain of our products are sensitive to changes in energy prices. Our industrial operations utilize significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and coal, and our transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. Significant increases in the cost of these items, including as a result of the Ukraine-Russia war, and currency fluctuations could adversely affect our operating costs and results. We also sell certain biofuel products, such as ethanol, renewable diesel, and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products. As a result, the selling prices of ethanol, renewable diesel, and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of oil, gasoline and diesel fuel. In turn, the selling prices of the agricultural commodities and commodity products that we sell, such as corn and vegetable oils that are used as feedstocks for biofuels, are also sensitive to changes in the market price for biofuels, and consequently world petroleum prices. Prices for petroleum products and biofuels are affected by market and geopolitical factors and government fuel policies, over which we have no control. Lower prices for oil, gasoline or diesel fuel could result in decreased selling prices for ethanol, renewable diesel, biodiesel and their raw materials, which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nOur business is seasonal, and our results may fluctuate depending on the harvest cycle of the crops upon which we rely and seasonal fluctuations related to the sale of our consumer products.\nAs with any agricultural business enterprise, our business operations are seasonal in nature. For example, in our Agribusiness segment, while there is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of our principal raw materials, such as oilseeds and grains, we typically do not experience material fluctuations in volume between the first and second half of the year since we are geographically diversified between the northern and southern hemispheres. However, the first quarter of the year has generally been our weakest in terms of financial results due to the timing of the North and South American oilseed harvests, as the North American oilseed harvest peaks in the third and fourth quarters, while the South American harvest peaks in the second quarter. This creates price fluctuations, which result in fluctuations in our inventories and a degree of seasonality in our gross profit. In addition, certain of our consumer food products are influenced by holidays and\n17\nother annual events. Seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. In addition, our quarterly results may vary as a result of the effects of fluctuations in commodities prices, production yields and costs.\nWe face intense competition in each of our businesses.\nWe face significant competition in each of our businesses and we have numerous competitors, some of which are larger, more diversified and have greater financial resources than we have. Additionally, in recent years we have experienced regional Agribusiness competitors entering new geographies where previously they did not compete with us, and certain customers seeking to procure certain commodities directly rather than through historical suppliers such as us. Furthermore, in conjunction with the recent increase in demand for renewable biodiesel feedstocks, we have experienced added competition for refining capacity from traditional petroleum companies. As many of the products we sell are global commodities, the markets for our products are highly price competitive, and in many cases also sensitive to product substitution. Additionally, the geographic location of assets can competitively advantage or disadvantage us with respect to our competitors in certain regions. We also face competition from changing technologies and shifting industry practices, such as increased on-farm crop storage in several regions, which allows producers to retain commodities for extended periods and increase price pressure on purchasers such as us. To compete effectively, we must continuously focus on improving efficiency in our production and distribution operations, including through business optimization initiatives, developing and offering products that meet customer needs, optimizing our geographic presence in key markets, developing and maintaining appropriate market share and customer relationships, supporting socially responsible and sustainable corporate and business practices, and promoting our environmental stewardship. We also compete for talent in our industries, particularly commercial personnel. Competition could cause us to lose market share and talented employees, exit certain lines of business, increase marketing or other expenditures, increase our raw material costs or reduce pricing, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nWe are vulnerable to the effects of supply and demand imbalances in our industries\n.\nHistorically, the market for some agricultural commodities and fertilizer products has been cyclical, with periods of high demand and capacity utilization stimulating new plant investment and the addition of incremental processing or production capacity by industry participants to meet the demand. The timing and extent of this expansion may then produce excess supply conditions in the market, which, until the supply/demand balance is again restored, negatively impacts product prices and operating results. During times of reduced market demand, we may suspend or reduce production at some of our facilities. The extent to which we efficiently manage available capacity at our facilities will affect our profitability, including the profitability of our Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables joint venture (\"Bunge Chevron JV\"). The business and financial performance of the Bunge Chevron JV may be adversely affected if there is a significant decrease in demand for renewable diesel. We also expect the results from our equity investment in the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture to be impacted by any potential shortage of, or increasing costs for, sugarcane which is the principal raw material used in the production of ethanol and sugar.\nWe are subject to global and regional economic downturns and related risks.\nThe level of demand for our products is affected by global and regional demographic and macroeconomic conditions, including population growth rates and changes in standards of living. A significant downturn in global economic growth, or recessionary conditions in major geographic regions, may lead to reduced demand for agricultural commodities and food products, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets, such as inflation, increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, uncertainty about economic stability, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could cause a decrease in demand for our products.\nAdditionally, weak global economic conditions and adverse conditions in global financial and capital markets, including rising interest rates and constraints on the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the financial condition and creditworthiness of the financial institutions that serve as our lenders and as counterparties to the over-the-counter derivative instruments we use to manage risks and some of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties, which in turn may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Over the course of the last year, concerns have arisen with respect to the financial condition of a number of regional banking organizations in the United States and global financial institutions. Although our exposure has been de minimis to these financial institutions, we continue to monitor our counterparty exposure across all of the financial services companies with which we conduct business. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for more information.\nIn 2023, certain of our raw material input costs increased materially and at a rapid rate. We expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2024. Further the United States has reported and is continuing to report weaker GDP growth, with some economists forecasting a continuation of these conditions in 2024. Brazil is experiencing a slowing GDP growth rate coupled with relatively high interest rates, which may result in an uncertain economic and political environment that could in\n18\nturn lead to reduced demand for our refined and specialty oils and milling products in the country. Argentina has experienced hyperinflation, high fiscal deficit and negative GDP growth in recent quarters, and faces additional uncertainty in connection with the newly-elected President's anticipated economic and monetary policies. Additionally, a slowdown in China's economy over a prolonged period, including as a result of population decline, real estate crisis and other factors, could lead to reduced global demand for agricultural commodities. To the extent that such economic and political conditions negatively impact consumer and business confidence and consumption patterns or volumes, our business and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to economic, political, and other risks of doing business globally and in emerging markets.\nWe are a global business with a substantial majority of our assets and operations located outside the United States. In addition, our business strategies may involve expanding or developing our business in emerging market regions, including Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. Due to the international nature of our business, we are exposed to various risks of international operations, including:\n•\nadverse trade policies or trade barriers on agricultural commodities and commodity products;\n•\nnew and developing requirements related to GHG emissions and other climate change initiatives and workforce diversity and inclusion mandates;\n•\ninflation, hyperinflation, and adverse economic effects resulting from governmental attempts to control inflation, such as the imposition of wage and price controls and higher interest rates. For example, inflation rates in many countries in which we operate are currently at the highest levels in decades, resulting in tighter monetary policies, including higher interest rates;\n•\nchanges in laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement in the countries in which we operate, including the effects of complying with Swiss tax law on us and our shareholders;\n•\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements or judgments and collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;\n•\nexchange controls or other currency restrictions and limitations on the movement of funds, such as on the remittance of dividends by subsidiaries, most notably in Ukraine, Egypt, and Argentina;\n•\ninadequate infrastructure and logistics challenges;\n•\nsovereign risk and the risk of government intervention, including through expropriation, or regulation of the economy or natural resources, including restrictions on foreign ownership of land or other assets;\n•\nthe requirement to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that apply to international operations, including, without limitation, economic sanctions regulations, labor laws, import and export regulations, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, as well as other laws or regulations discussed in this \"Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\n\" section;\n•\nchallenges in maintaining an effective internal control environment with operations in multiple international locations, including language differences, varying levels of U.S. GAAP expertise in international locations and multiple financial information systems;\n•\nchanges in a country’s or region’s economic or political condition; and\n•\nlabor disruptions, civil unrest, significant political instability, coup attempts, wars or other armed conflict or acts of terrorism. See \"\n—The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\"\nThese risks could adversely affect our operations, business strategies, and operating results.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are also exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies, particularly the Brazilian\nreal\n, Canadian\ndollar\n, the\neuro\n, and Chinese\nyuan/renminbi\naffect our revenues and expenses that are denominated in local currencies, affect farm economics in those regions and may also have a negative impact on the value of our assets located outside of the United States.\nAdditionally, there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty regarding U.S. and global trade policies for companies with multinational operations like ours. In recent years, there has been an increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and consequently historical free trade principles are being challenged. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on the nature and extent of any such changes and how well we are able to anticipate, respond to and effectively manage any such changes.\n19\nGovernment policies and regulations affecting the agricultural sector and related industries could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nAgricultural commodity production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes (including \"windfall profits\" taxes), tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions, price controls on agricultural commodities, and energy policies (including biofuels mandates), can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops versus other uses of agricultural resources, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, and the volume and types of imports and exports. Additionally, regulation of financial markets and instruments in the United States and internationally may create uncertainty as these laws are adopted and implemented and may impose significant additional risks and costs that could impact our risk management practices. Further, increases in food and fertilizer prices have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of our industries under antitrust and competition laws in various jurisdictions and increase the risk that these laws could be interpreted, administered or enforced in a manner that could affect our operations or impose liabilities on us that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Future governmental policies, regulations or actions impacting our industries may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of our products, restrict our ability to do business in existing and target markets, or engage in risk management activities and otherwise cause our financial results to suffer.\nFinally, international trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions, particularly disputes involving the United States and China. This has in the past led, and can in the future lead, to significant volatility in commodity prices, disruptions in historical trade flows and shifts in planting patterns in the United States and South America, which have presented challenges and uncertainties for our business. We cannot predict the impacts that future trade policy or the terms of any negotiated trade agreements could have on our business and operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures.\nWe have been an active acquirer of other companies, including our pending acquisition of Viterra. We also have joint ventures with several partners, including the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture related to our sugar and ethanol business in Brazil and the Bunge Chevron JV for manufacturing low lifecycle carbon intensity transportation fuels. Part of our strategy involves acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures designed to expand or optimize our portfolio of businesses. Our ability to benefit from acquisitions, joint ventures, and alliances depends on many factors, including our ability to identify suitable prospects, access funding sources on acceptable terms, negotiate favorable transaction terms, and successfully consummate and integrate any businesses we acquire. In addition, we proactively review our portfolio of businesses in order to identify opportunities to enhance shareholder value and may decide as a result of such reviews or otherwise, from time to time, to divest certain of our assets or businesses by selling them or entering into joint ventures. Our ability to successfully complete a divestiture will depend on, among other things, our ability to identify buyers that are prepared to acquire such assets or businesses on acceptable terms and to adjust and optimize our retained businesses following the divestiture.\nOur acquisition, joint venture, or divestiture activities may involve unanticipated delays, costs, and other problems. If we encounter unexpected problems with acquisitions, joint ventures, or divestitures, our senior management may be required to divert attention away from other aspects of our businesses to address these problems. Additionally, we may fail to consummate proposed acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, after incurring expenses and devoting substantial resources, including management time, to such transactions.\nAcquisitions also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions by an acquired company and its management before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, the controls and policies we implement at acquired companies, and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies, may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities. A material liability associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations and reduce the benefits of the acquisition. Additionally, acquisitions involve other risks, such as differing levels of management and internal control effectiveness at the acquired entities, systems integration risks, the risk of impairment charges relating to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, the risk of significant accounting charges and expenses resulting from the completion and integration of a sizable acquisition, the need to fund increased capital expenditures and working capital requirements, our ability to retain and motivate employees of acquired entities, compliance and reputational risks and other unanticipated problems and liabilities. See the risk factors under the sections entitled “Risks Relating to the Acquisition” and “Risks Relating to the Combined Company” under this Item 1A for additional discussions on our pending acquisition of Viterra.\nDivestitures may also expose us to potential liabilities or claims for indemnification, as we may be required to retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters, including legal, environmental, or litigation matters associated with\n20\nthe assets or businesses that we sell. For example, in connection with the sale of our Russian operations in 2023, we were required to indemnify the buyer against certain existing legal claims related to the business. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and its cost to us could ultimately exceed the proceeds we receive for the divested assets or businesses. Divestitures also have other inherent risks, including possible delays in closing transactions (including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals), the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses and unexpected costs or other difficulties associated with the separation of the businesses to be sold from our information technology systems and other management processes, including the loss of key personnel. Further, expected cost savings or other anticipated efficiencies or benefits from divestitures may also be difficult to achieve or maximize.\nAdditionally, we have several joint ventures and investments in which we have limited control over governance, financial reporting, and operations. As a result, we face certain operating, financial, and other risks relating to these investments, including risks related to the financial strength of our joint venture partners or their willingness to provide adequate funding for the joint venture, having differing objectives from our partners, the inability to implement some actions with respect to the joint venture's activities that we may believe are favorable if the joint venture partner does not agree, compliance risks relating to actions of the joint venture or our partners, and the risk that we will be unable to effectively work with or resolve disputes with the joint venture partner. As a result, these investments may contribute significantly less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are subject to industry and other risks that could adversely affect our reputation and financial results.\nWe are subject to food and feed industry risks which include, but are not limited to, spoilage, contamination, tampering or other adulteration of products, product liability claims, and recalls. We are also subject to shifts in customer and consumer preferences, and concerns regarding the outbreak of disease associated with livestock and poultry, including avian or swine influenza. Also, increasing focus on climate change, deforestation, water, animal welfare and human rights concerns, and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased activism focusing on food companies and their suppliers, governmental intervention and consumer responses. These risks could adversely affect our, or our suppliers’, reputations and businesses and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business.\nAs a company whose products comprise staple food and feed products sold globally, as well as ingredients included in trusted food brands of our customers, maintaining a good corporate reputation is critical to our continued success. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions, which can shift rapidly in response to negative incidents. The failure or alleged failure to maintain high standards for quality, safety, integrity, environmental sustainability and social responsibility, including with respect to raw materials and services obtained from suppliers, even if untrue, may result in tangible effects, such as reduced demand for our products, disruptions to our operations, increased costs and a loss of market share to competitors. Our reputation and results of operations could also be adversely impacted by changing consumer preferences and perceptions relating to some of the products we sell, such as with regard to the quantity and type of fats, sugars, and grains consumed, as well as concerns regarding genetically modified crops. Failure to anticipate, adapt or respond effectively to these trends or issues may result in material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations globally, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nDue to our global business operations, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. These include general business regulations, such as with respect to taxes, accounting, anti-corruption and fair competition, trade sanctions, product safety, and environmental matters, as well as those governing the manufacturing, production, handling, storage, transport, marketing and sale of our products. These include laws and regulations relating to facility licensing and permitting, food and feed safety, the handling and production of regulated substances, nutritional and labeling requirements, global trade compliance and other matters. Our operations and those of our suppliers are also subject to restrictions on land use in certain protected areas, forestry reserve requirements, and limitations on water use. In addition to liabilities arising out of our current and future operations for which we have ongoing processes to manage compliance with regulatory obligations, we may be subject to environmental liabilities for past operations at current facilities and in some cases to liabilities for past operations at facilities that we no longer own or operate. We may also be subject to liabilities for operations of acquired companies. Our industrial activities can also result in serious accidents that could result in personal injuries, facility shutdowns, reputational harm to our business and/or the expenditure of significant amounts to remediate safety issues or repair damaged facilities. We may incur material costs or liabilities to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to substantial fines, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, revocations of operating permits and/or shutdowns of our facilities, litigation, and other liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the\n21\nOffice of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products, or to provide services outside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal or civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, continued government and public emphasis in countries in which we operate on environmental issues, including climate change, conservation and natural resource management, have resulted in and could result in new or more stringent forms of regulatory oversight or other limitations on the agricultural industry, including increased environmental controls, land-use restrictions affecting us or our suppliers and other conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. For example, certain aspects of our business and the larger food production chain generate carbon emissions. A number of jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce GHG emissions, including, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, and China. For example, the Biden Administration has issued a series of executive orders and regulatory initiatives focused on climate change, including rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, pursuant to which the Administration has announced a goal of halving U.S. GHG emissions by 2030. In addition, the EUDR, which is scheduled to become effective in December 2024, will require companies trading in certain commodities, including oil palm and soy, as well as products derived from these commodities, to ensure these commodities and related products do not result from deforestation, forest degradation, or breaches of local laws after December 31, 2020 in order to sell such products in the European Union. The imposition of regulatory restrictions related to GHG emissions and conservation in many markets in which we operate, which may include limitations on GHG emissions, national emission reduction plans, requirements to make additional investments to modify our facilities, equipment and processes, other restrictions on industrial operations, taxes or fees on GHG emissions, and other measures, could affect land-use decisions, the cost of agricultural production and the cost and means of processing and transporting our products, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, and results of operations. We are also subject to a number of ESG disclosure frameworks, such as the CSRD in the European Union, the Swiss non-financial reporting requirements and child labor due diligence and transparency, and the California Climate Accountability Package, and as regulators increasingly focus on climate change and other sustainability matters, we may become subject to new, more stringent ESG disclosure frameworks, such as the SEC’s proposed climate disclosure rules. See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulations.”\nWe are exposed to credit and counterparty risk relating to our customer and supplier counterparties in the ordinary course of business. In particular, we advance capital and provide other financing arrangements to farmers in Brazil and, as a result, our business and financial results may be adversely affected if these farmers are unable to repay the capital advanced to them.\nWe have various credit terms with customers, and our customers have varying degrees of creditworthiness, which exposes us to the risk of non-payment or other default under our contracts and other arrangements with them. In the event that we experience significant defaults on their payment obligations to us, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn Brazil, where there have been limited third-party financing sources available to farmers, we provide financing to farmers from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities through prepaid commodity purchase contracts and advances, which are generally intended to be short-term in nature and are typically secured by the farmer's crop and a mortgage on the farmer's land and other assets to provide a means of repayment in the potential event of crop failure or shortfall. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we had approximately $825 million and $651 million in outstanding prepaid commodity purchase contracts, and advances to farmers. We are exposed to the risk that the underlying crop will be insufficient to satisfy a farmer's obligation under the financing arrangements as a result of weather and crop growing conditions, and other factors that influence the price, supply and demand for agricultural commodities. In addition, any collateral held by us as part of these financing transactions may not be sufficient to fully protect us from loss.\nWe are a capital intensive business and depend on cash provided by our operations as well as access to external financing to operate and grow our business.\nWe require significant amounts of capital to operate our business and fund capital expenditures. Our working capital needs are directly affected by the prices of agricultural commodities, with increases in commodity prices generally causing increases in our borrowing levels. We are also required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain, upgrade, and expand our extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, logistics assets, and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances and safety and environmental standards. Furthermore, the expansion of our business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require us to make significant\n22\ninvestments into our business. Although we are selective with the capital expenditures and other investments we make, we may not realize the benefits of such capital expenditures and investments in the expected time frame, if at all.\nFurthermore, the expansion of our business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require access to significant amounts of capital. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or raise sufficient external financing on attractive terms to fund these activities, including as a result of a tightening in the global credit markets, we may be forced to limit our operations and growth plans, which may adversely impact our competitiveness and, therefore, our results of operations. At December 31, 2023, Bunge had $5,665 million unused and available committed borrowing capacity comprising committed revolving credit facilities with a number of financial institutions. At December 31, 2023, our total debt balance is $4,882 million. Our debt levels could limit our ability to obtain additional financing, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the markets in which we compete, place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged than we are, and require us to dedicate more cash on a relative basis to servicing our debt and less to developing our business. This may limit our ability to run our business and use our resources in the manner in which we would like. Furthermore, difficult conditions in global credit or financial markets, including increases in interest rates and diminished liquidity and credit availability, generally could increase the cost to finance our operations, adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt or the cost or other terms of such refinancing, or adversely affect the financial position of the lenders with whom we do business, which may reduce our ability to obtain financing for our operations. See \"Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\n\"\nAccess to credit markets and pricing of company debt is also dependent on maintaining appropriate credit ratings, and one of our financial objectives has been to maintain an investment grade credit rating. While our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt, reductions in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and, depending on their severity, could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on favorable terms, as well as impair our ability to compete effectively relative to competitors with higher credit ratings.\nOur risk management strategies may not be effective.\nOur business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. We engage in hedging transactions to manage these risks. However, our exposures may not always be fully hedged, and our hedging strategies may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations. In addition, our risk management strategies may seek to position our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements. While we have implemented a broad range of risk monitoring and control procedures and policies to mitigate potential losses, they may not in all cases be successful in anticipating a significant risk exposure and protecting us from losses that have the potential to impair our financial position. See \"Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\".\nThe loss of, or a disruption in, our manufacturing and distribution operations or other operations and systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are engaged in manufacturing and distribution activities on a global scale, and our business depends on our ability to execute and monitor, on a daily basis, a significant number of transactions across numerous markets or geographies. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, fires, explosions, strikes and other labor or industrial disputes, disruptions in logistics or information systems, as well as natural disasters, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), wars (including the Ukraine-Russia war and conflicts in the Middle East), acts of terrorism, and other external factors over which we have no control.\nWhile we insure ourselves against many of these types of risks in accordance with industry standards, our level of insurance may not cover all losses. The potential effects of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur information technology systems, processes and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches or failures that may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nWe rely on certain key information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data and services for internal and external users, including procurement and inventory management, transaction processing, financial, commercial and operational data, human resources management, legal and tax compliance, and other information and processes necessary to operate and manage our business. If we or our third-party service providers do not respond or perform effectively in connection with a cybersecurity breach or system failure, our business may be impacted.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cybersecurity attacks pose a potentially significant risk to the security of our information technology systems, networks and services, as well as the\n23\nconfidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the confidential data of our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties that we may hold. Such vulnerabilities include, among other things, social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats and zero-day vulnerability exploits. We may incur significant costs in protecting against potential security breaches, cyber-based attacks, or other cybersecurity incidents. We and our third-party service providers are targeted by malicious actors and expect such incidents to continue and the frequency and severity of such attacks to increase. While we have implemented cybersecurity and data protection measures, our efforts to minimize the risks and impacts of cyberattacks and protect our information technology systems may be insufficient and we may experience significant breaches or other failures or disruptions that could compromise our systems and the information we store and, ultimately, affect our business operations and results of operations. Additionally, hybrid or remote work arrangements among our employees and employees of our third-party providers present additional operational risks to our information technology systems, including, but not limited to, increased risks of cyberattacks and security breaches. We are also exposed to the risk of insider threat attacks. New technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyberattacks.\nIn addition, the risk of cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks against the Ukrainian government and other countries in the region, has increased in connection with the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, driven by justifications such as retaliation for the sanctions imposed in conjunction with the war, or in response to certain companies’ continued operations in Russia. It is possible that these attacks could have collateral effects on additional critical infrastructure and financial institutions globally. While we no longer have operations in Russia, we do have operations in the region that, along with our operations globally, could be adversely affected by these attacks, including cyber-based attacks against our information technology systems, or be at risk to collateral effects of such attacks. While we have taken actions to mitigate such potential risks, the proliferation of malware from the war into systems unrelated to the war, or cyberattacks against U.S. companies in retaliation for U.S. sanctions against Russia, or U.S. support of Ukraine, could also adversely affect our operations.\nWe have implemented security policies, training programs, measures and disaster recovery plans designed to prevent, detect and mitigate cyber-based attacks, and to protect the security and continuity of our networks and critical systems. We use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company and user data or accounts. In addition, we also conduct tests and assessments using independent third parties on a regular basis. These measures may not adequately prevent adverse events such as breaches or failures from occurring, or mitigate their severity if they do occur.\nIf our information technology systems are breached, damaged or fail to function properly due to any number of causes, such as security breaches or cyber-based attacks, systems implementation difficulties, catastrophic events or power outages, and our security, contingency disaster recovery, or other risk mitigation plans do not effectively mitigate these occurrences on a timely basis, we may experience a material disruption in our ability to manage our business operations and produce financial reports, as well as significant costs and lost business opportunities until they are remediated. Further, our sensitive information may be compromised and we may suffer representational harm. While we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks in place, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise, and we cannot be certain that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding data privacy, data protection, and data security, including laws related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal information. Data privacy regulations continue to evolve, and non-compliance with such regulations, including as a result of adoption of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, could subject the Company to legal claims or proceedings, potential regulatory fines and penalties and damage to our reputation. These factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our competitive position.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income taxes in various jurisdictions throughout the world. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes, along with interest and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits and assessments in order to assess the appropriateness of our tax assets and liabilities. However, the calculation of such liabilities involves significant judgment in the interpretation of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a taxing authority may result in a payment or outcome that is significantly different from current estimates. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition in the periods in which they are recognized.\n24\nAdditionally, changes in tax laws could materially impact our effective tax rate and the monetization of recoverable tax assets (indirect tax credits). For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\") Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\"BEPS\") initiative, which is supported by governments of certain major countries and jurisdictions, seeks to, among other things, ensure large multinational companies, like Bunge, pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each of the jurisdictions where they operate, could adversely impact our effective tax rate. We do not expect the impact of BEPS to have a material impact on our effective tax rate in 2024. Furthermore, the ongoing efforts in corporate tax transparency by the OECD and a number of countries has resulted in additional mandatory disclosures, which will likely cause additional scrutiny of the Company's tax positions and potentially increased tax assessments. Additionally, increased grain and food prices globally have resulted in some jurisdictions as well as activists and social groups calling for a “windfall profits” tax on agricultural grain traders and producers. So far, only one jurisdiction has implemented such tax on food distributors, which is set to expire after 2024. While such tax has not had a material impact on Bunge, the imposition of, or increase in, windfall profit taxes in the markets we operate in could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and profitability.\nOur operations are dependent on a wide array of third parties.\nThe success of our supply chain relies on the continued performance of a wide array of third parties. Suppliers, vendors, co-manufacturers, third-party outsourcers, warehousing partners, and transportation providers are among our critical business partners. Although we take steps to qualify and audit third parties with whom we do business, we cannot guarantee that all third parties will perform dependably or at all. It is possible that events beyond our control, such as financial issues, operational failures, labor issues, cybersecurity events, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other public health issues, or other systemic issues could impact our unaffiliated third parties. If our third parties fail to deliver on their commitments, introduce unplanned risk to our operations, such as exposing us to cybersecurity-related compromises, or are unable to fulfill their obligations, we could experience manufacturing challenges, shipment delays, increased costs, or lost revenue.\nOur operations have been and may in the future be adversely impacted as a result of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics.\nPublic health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any outbreaks of new public health crises, pandemics and epidemics and the related government responses may adversely affect our operations, facilities, health of our employees and consumers, as well as general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base. The extent to which we may be impacted by future outbreaks of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics is difficult to predict and will depend on many factors outside of our control. These factors include the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of any pandemic, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. To the extent any public health crisis, pandemic or epidemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and share price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Item 1A.\nWe are dependent on our executive management and other key personnel.\nOur success depends on our executive management team and other key personnel with skills upon which our business depends, and our ability to effectively identify, attract, retain, and motivate high quality employees, and replace those who retire or resign. We believe that we have an experienced and highly qualified executive management team, and the loss of service of any one or more of these key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on our operations and our future profitability. Failure to retain and motivate our executive management team and to hire, retain, and develop other important personnel, which may be particularly challenging given the current dynamics in certain labor markets in which we operate, could generally impact other levels of our management and operations, as well as our ability to execute our strategies and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, Swiss law prohibits us from paying certain severance payments to our executive management, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions.\nRisks Relating to the Registered Shares\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law, and it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us and our directors and officers.\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and our articles of association (the \"Articles of Association\"). The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Bermuda, our domicile prior to the Redomestication. Swiss law reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. See Exhibit 4.2 for an overview of certain material terms and provisions of the Company’s registered shares and “Comparison of Rights of Shareholders” in our definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on August 7, 2023 (the “Definitive Proxy Statement”), for a comparison of the\n25\nrights of our shareholders under Bermuda law prior to the Redomestication to the current rights of our shareholders under Swiss law.\nSeveral of our directors and officers are non-residents of the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of those directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process on those persons in the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or those persons based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. It is uncertain whether Swiss courts would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against Bunge Global or other persons that are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws or original actions brought against Bunge Global or other persons predicated upon the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The enforceability in Switzerland of a foreign judgment rendered against Bunge Global or such other persons is subject to the limitations set forth in such international treaties by which Switzerland is bound and the Swiss Federal Private International Law Act. In particular, and without limitation to the foregoing, a judgment rendered by a foreign court may only be enforced in Switzerland if:\n•\nsuch foreign court had jurisdiction,\n•\nsuch judgment has become final and non-appealable,\n•\nthe court procedures leading to such judgment followed the principles of due process of law, including proper service of process, and\n•\nsuch judgment does not violate Swiss law principles of public policy.\nIn addition, enforceability of a judgment by a non-Swiss court in Switzerland may be limited if Bunge Global can demonstrate that it or such other persons were not effectively served with process. We have been advised that the U.S. and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they are contrary to Switzerland's public policy.\nAs a Swiss corporation, our flexibility will be limited with respect to certain aspects of capital management.\nSwiss law regulates a corporation’s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely available equity is available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our stated share capital, unless our shareholders authorize (including through the capital band) the Board to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation in order to effect a capital reduction.\nSwiss law allows Bunge Global’s shareholders to authorize the Board to issue shares without additional shareholder approval, but this authorization is limited to (i) 50% of Bunge Global’s stated share capital (among other things, the issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition or to raise new equity capital, subject to compliance with shareholders' preemptive rights, unless withdrawn for the reasons specified in the Articles of Association) (the so-called \"capital band\")  and (ii) an additional 20% of Bunge Global’s stated share capital for the issuance of shares in connection with convertible or similar financial instruments and our equity incentive plans (the so-called \"conditional share capital\"). The Board's authority to issue shares based on the capital band must be renewed by the shareholders every five years.  Bunge Global’s Articles of Association provides for a capital band authorizing the Board to issue up to 80,714,736 new shares or to cancel or reduce the par value of up to 32,285,894 shares (including to cancel shares repurchased under Bunge Global's share repurchase program) until October 19, 2028. After October 19, 2028, the capital band will only be available to the Board for issuance or cancellation of registered shares if a renewed authorization is approved by shareholders.\nAdditionally, Swiss law grants existing shareholders preemptive rights to subscribe for newly issued shares and advance subscription rights to subscribe for convertible and similar financial instruments. Preemptive rights and advance subscription rights may be limited or withdrawn only for valid reasons. In connection with share issuances based on the capital band and the conditional share capital, the preemptive rights and the advance subscription rights may only be limited or withdrawn for the reasons specified in the Article of Association.\nSwiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares. Further, Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions, including the declaration and approval of  dividend distributions under certain circumstances. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility to swiftly implement certain initiatives or strategies, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.\nFurther, we are required, from time to time, to evaluate the carrying amount of our investments in affiliates, as presented on our Swiss standalone balance sheet. If we determine that the carrying amount of any such investment exceeds its fair value, we may conclude that such investment is impaired. Any recognized loss associated with such a non-cash impairment could result in our net assets no longer covering our statutory share capital and statutory capital reserves. Under Swiss law, if our net\n26\nassets cover less than 50% of our statutory share capital and the non-distributable part of the statutory capital and profit reserves, the Board must take appropriate measures or, to the extent such measures fall within the competence of the general meeting of shareholders, convene a general meeting of shareholders, and propose measures to remedy such a capital loss. Appropriate measures depend on the relevant circumstances and the magnitude of the recognized loss and may include seeking shareholder approval for offsetting the aggregate loss, or a portion thereof, with our statutory capital reserves, including qualifying capital contribution reserves otherwise available for distributions to shareholders, or raising new equity. Depending on the circumstances, we may also need to use qualifying capital contribution reserves available for distributions in order to reduce our accumulated net loss and such use might reduce our ability to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.\nWe may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.\nUnder current Swiss law, distributions made out of qualifying capital contribution reserves recognized by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration or made in the form of a par value reduction are not subject to Swiss withholding tax. However, there can be no assurances that the Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that shareholders will approve a distribution out of qualifying capital contribution reserves recognized by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration or a reduction in par value for distributions. Further, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying contribution reserves available for Bunge Global may be limited. If Bunge Global is unable to make a distribution out of qualifying capital contribution reserves or through a reduction in par value, then any dividend distributions paid by Bunge Global will generally be subject to a Swiss withholding tax at a rate of 35%. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, which we refer to as the “U.S.-Swiss Treaty,” may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). Switzerland currently has concluded more than 70 tax treaties with the same treatment regarding the refund of Swiss withholding taxes.\nUnder current Swiss law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value plus qualifying capital contributions reserves and the repurchase price. Over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying contribution reserves available for Bunge Global may be limited. Bunge Global may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, whereby Swiss institutional investors purchase Bunge Global shares from you and then sell the shares to Bunge Global and apply for a refund of the Swiss withholding tax. However, if Bunge Global is unable to use this process successfully, Bunge Global may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes. Please see “\nCertain Tax Considerations—of the Redomestication—Swiss Tax Considerations—Consequences to Shareholders of Bunge-Switzerland Subsequent to the Redomestication—Repurchases of Shares\"\nin the Definitive Proxy Statement for more information.\nThe Redomestication will continue to result in additional costs to us and may result in taxes in certain jurisdictions on the indirect transfer of shares or property of Bunge.\nThe Redomestication has resulted in an increase in some of our ongoing expenses and will require us to incur some new ongoing expenses.\nAdditionally, we generally expect to be exempt from most indirect transfer, transaction, and gains taxes on shares and property held directly or indirectly by Bunge that could apply to the Redomestication; however, the calculation of such liabilities involves judgment in the interpretation of complex tax law and regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a taxing authority may result in a payment or outcome that differs from our current expectations. In jurisdictions where we expect to be subject to indirect transfer, transaction, and gains taxes as a result of the Redomestication, we expect the amounts to be immaterial based on current estimates. However, these taxes are generally based on the fair market value of underlying shares and property which is subject to interpretation. Accordingly, amounts actually owed could exceed current estimates.\nWe have anti-takeover provisions in our Articles of Association that may discourage a change of control.\nOur Articles of Association have provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect. Our Articles of Association has a capital band provision, according to which the Board is authorized, at any time until October 19, 2028, to limit or withdraw the preemptive rights of the existing shareholders in various circumstances. Under our capital band, the Board has authority to issue up to 80,714,736 new shares or to cancel or reduce the par value of up to 32,285,894 shares until October 19, 2028.\nThis provision, as well as any additional anti-takeover measures our Board could adopt in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party's offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders. As a result, shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\n27\nRisks Relating to the Pending Viterra Acquisition\nAs a result of the Acquisition, our shareholders will have reduced ownership and voting interest in and will exercise less influence over management of the combined company.\nOur shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Board and on other matters affecting us. Upon consummation of the Acquisition, each of our shareholders will become a shareholder of the combined company with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is smaller than each such shareholder’s percentage ownership of Bunge immediately prior to the Acquisition. Upon completion of the transaction, the Sellers are expected to own approximately 30% of the combined Bunge company on a fully diluted basis, before giving effect to any share repurchases by Bunge occurring after June 13, 2023.  Accordingly, our current shareholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of Bunge.\nOur and Viterra’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Acquisition.\nParties with which we or Viterra do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Acquisition, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, Viterra or the combined business. Our and Viterra’s business relationships may be subject to disruption as clients, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us, Viterra or the combined business. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the combined business, including a material and adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition. The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion or termination of the Acquisition.\nUntil the completion or termination of the Acquisition, we and Viterra are prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, Viterra and/or our respective shareholders.\nFrom and after the date of the Business Combination Agreement and prior to completion of the Acquisition, the Business Combination Agreement restricts us and Viterra from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party and requires that the business of each company and its respective subsidiaries be conducted independently in the ordinary course in all material respects. These restrictions may prevent us or Viterra from taking actions that would be beneficial. Adverse effects arising from these restrictions during the pendency of the Acquisition could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation or termination of the Acquisition.\nThird parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with us or Viterra.\nWe and Viterra each have contracts with customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, landlords, licensors, joint venture partners, and other business partners which may require us or Viterra, as applicable, to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the Acquisition. If these consents cannot be obtained, the counterparties to these contracts and other third parties with which we and/or Viterra currently have relationships may have the ability to terminate, reduce the scope of or otherwise materially adversely alter their relationships with either or both parties in anticipation of the Acquisition, or with the combined company following the Acquisition. The pursuit of such rights may result in Bunge or the combined company suffering a loss of potential future revenue or incurring liabilities in connection with a breach of such agreements and losing rights that are material to its business. Any such disruptions could limit the combined company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition. The adverse effect of such disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion or termination of the Acquisition.\nObtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the Acquisition.\nThe Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Business Combination Agreement, including, (i) any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the \"HSR Act\") relating to the transaction shall have expired or been terminated, (ii) all required consents, clearances, authorizations and approvals pursuant to antitrust laws, foreign investments laws, and other laws, as applicable, having been obtained, (iii) no law, order, injunction or decree will be in effect that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the Acquisition, and (iv) the increase in our share capital to effect the issuance of registered shares to Viterra shareholders and the related amendments to our governing documents in connection therewith has been registered with the competent cantonal commercial register in Switzerland. Although we and Viterra have agreed in the Business Combination Agreement to use our reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings or obtain the required governmental authorizations, as the case may be, no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required approvals are obtained and the conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals. Any\n28\ndelay in completing the Acquisition could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Acquisition is successfully completed within its expected time frame.\nThe Acquisition could be terminated.\nEither we or Viterra may terminate the Business Combination Agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the Acquisition is not consummated by June 13, 2024, which may automatically be extended up to two times, each for a period of three months, due to failure to obtain certain regulatory clearances. Each of the Sellers, acting collectively, on the one hand, and Bunge, on the other hand, may further extend the termination date up to two additional times, each for a period of three months, due to failure to obtain these regulatory clearances. If the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in connection with certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain certain antitrust and competition clearances that are conditions to closing, we would be obligated to pay to Viterra a fee of $400 million in the aggregate.\nFailure to complete the Acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Acquisition is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Acquisition, we could be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n•\nWe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and from our clients, staff and vendors;\n•\nWe may be required to pay Viterra or the Sellers, as applicable, a fee of up to approximately $400 million if the Acquisition is not consummated;\n•\nWe will be required to pay certain transaction expenses and other costs relating to the Acquisition, whether or not the Acquisition is completed;\n•\nThe Business Combination Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Acquisition; and\n•\nMatters relating to the Acquisition (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nThere can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize.  If any of those risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nWe and Viterra may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the Acquisition.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Acquisition on our employees and Viterra’s employees may have an adverse effect on each of us and Viterra separately and consequently the combined business. This uncertainty may impair our and Viterra’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Acquisition is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Acquisition, as our employees and Viterra’s employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. Furthermore, if our key employees or Viterra’s key employees depart or are at risk of departing, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become team members of the combined business, we may have to incur significant costs in retaining such individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may be adversely affected.\nShareholder lawsuits relating to the Acquisition have been, and may in the future be filed against us, which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Acquisition from being completed\n.\nShareholder lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into transactions like the Acquisition. Such a shareholder lawsuit was filed against us in connection with the Acquisition, which subsequently has been dismissed, but there is no assurance that there will not be additional shareholder lawsuits brought against us in connection with the Acquisition. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Acquisition, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Acquisition from being completed.\nThe incurrence of debt to fund the pending acquisition of Viterra may impact our financial position and subject us to additional financial and operating restrictions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $4.9 billion of total debt. We expect to incur a substantial amount of additional debt in connection with the pending acquisition of Viterra. We expect that upon completion of the pending acquisition of Viterra and the related financing transactions, our total debt will increase to approximately $16 billion. In\n29\naddition, we expect to have capacity to incur significant additional debt to fund our working capital needs and for other corporate purposes. We have secured a total of $8.0 billion in acquisition debt financing in the form of a $7.7 billion financing commitment from a consortium of lenders and a $300 million five-year delayed draw term loan. The commitment is in the form of a three-tranche term loan maturing 364 days, two years and three years from the closing of the Acquisition. We expect to obtain long-term unsecured debt financing in lieu of all or a portion of the commitments provided under the $7.7 billion financing commitment. However, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain such permanent debt financing or that it will be on acceptable terms, in which case, our debt portfolio may have a shorter maturity profile thus increasing our liquidity and refinancing risk. Although we expect to repay certain of Viterra's existing debt at closing, existing notes of Viterra totaling approximately $3.3 billion are expected to survive closing and we plan to take the required actions in order to have such notes be pari-passu with existing senior unsecured indebtedness of Bunge.\nInterest rates may rise to levels that are significantly higher than where they are today, thereby increasing our overall cost of capital. In addition, we anticipate that as a result of the debt we expect to incur to finance the Acquisition, credit rating agencies will review our credit rating. While as part of their ratings review and subsequent credit opinions related to the Acquisition, S&P, Moody’s and Fitch have placed us on positive outlook, review for upgrade and credit watch positive, respectively for a one notch upgrade to A-, Baa1 and BBB+, respectively, there is no assurance that these upgrades to the credit ratings will materialize. The rating agencies have also outlined certain scenarios under which our current credit ratings may be downgraded at or ahead of the closing. Any potential future negative change in our credit ratings may make it more expensive for us to raise long-term financing on terms that are acceptable to us or to raise additional capital on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all, and may negatively impact the price of registered shares, increase our overall cost of capital, and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the Acquisition, regardless of whether the Acquisition is completed.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the Acquisition. These expenses include, but are not limited to, fees related to arranging debt financing, financial advisory and opinion fees and expenses, legal fees, accounting fees and expenses, certain employee expenses, consulting fees, filing fees, printing expenses and other related fees and expenses. Many of these expenses will be payable by us regardless of whether the Acquisition is completed.\nIf our due diligence investigation of Viterra was inadequate or if risks related to Viterra’s business materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders’ investment.\nEven though we conducted a customary due diligence investigation of Viterra, we cannot be sure that our diligence surfaced all material issues that may be present inside Viterra or its business, or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of Viterra and its business and outside of its control will not arise later. If any such material issues arise or if known risks prove to be more significant than expected, the ongoing business of the combined company and our shareholders’ investment may be materially and adversely impacted.\nThe outstanding capital stock of Viterra is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it difficult to determine the fair market value of Viterra. The aggregate consideration for the Viterra is set forth in the Business Combination Agreement as a result of negotiations and because these share amounts are fixed, they will not adjust to factor in any change in the value of  Viterra before closing. As a result, there is no guarantee that the value of the aggregate consideration in the Acquisition will align with the actual value of the Viterra at closing.\nRisks Relating to the Combined Company\nBecause we and Viterra operate similar businesses in similar industries, the risks relating to us and our business are generally the same as the risks relating to the combined company. This section should be read in conjunction with the other risk factors discussed under this Item 1A.\nAfter completion of the Acquisition, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, which could adversely affect the value of registered shares.\nThe success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Bunge and Viterra. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks including:\n•\nOur ability to successfully combine the businesses of Bunge and Viterra;\n•\nWhether the combined businesses will perform as expected;\n•\nThe incurrence of indebtedness to finance the Acquisition and the need to dedicate a greater amount of cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness; and\n30\n•\nThe assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Viterra.\nIf we are not able to successfully integrate and combine the businesses of Bunge and Viterra within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected, and the value of Bunge shares may be adversely affected.\nIt is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of our key staff or Viterra’s key staff, the disruption of either or both company’s ongoing businesses, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition so the combined business performs as expected include, among other things:\n•\nidentifying and adopting the best practices of the two organizations to position the combined business for future growth;\n•\nintegrating the companies’ technologies, systems and services;\n•\nharmonizing the companies’ operating practices, reporting structure, staff development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes, including compliance by the acquired operations with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the documentation and testing of internal control procedures under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which includes remediating certain deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting of Viterra identified in connection with the audit of its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 that constituted a material weakness and resulted in financial statement restatements;\n•\nrebranding operations and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n•\nconsolidating the companies’ corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure;\n•\nmaintaining existing agreements with clients and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective clients; and\n•\nidentifying and eliminating redundant assets and expenses and consolidating locations of us and Viterra that are currently in close proximity to each other.\nIn addition, at times, the attention of certain members of either or both companies’ management and resources may be focused on completion of the Acquisition and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company’s ongoing business and the business of the combined company.\nWe will incur significant integration-related costs in connection with the Acquisition and we may not be able to obtain the anticipated synergies of the combined company.\nWe will incur significant integration-related fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and staff-related costs.  We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Acquisition and the integration of Viterra into our business. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other synergies and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, that may allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all, and we may incur difficulties and delays in integrating Viterra’s business following completion of the Acquisition or fully realizing the anticipated cost synergies and other benefits expected from the Acquisition.\nThe market price for registered shares of the combined company following the completion of the Acquisition may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those that historically have affected or currently affect the market prices of the registered shares.\nThe results of operations of the combined company will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently or historically affecting our results of operations and those currently or historically affecting the results of operations of Viterra. The results of operations of the combined company may also be affected by factors different from those that currently affect or have historically affected either Bunge or Viterra.\nCertain Sellers will be able to exercise influence over the composition of the Board, matters subject to shareholder approval and/or our operations.\nUpon the completion of the Acquisition, the number of registered shares expected to be issued to Glencore, CPP Investments and BCI will represent approximately 15%, 12% and 3% of our outstanding registered shares, based on the number of our outstanding registered shares as of December 31, 2023, or in the aggregate approximately 30% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis before giving effect to any share repurchases by Bunge occurring after June 13, 2023. As part of our announced plan to repurchase $2.0 billion of registered shares, Bunge has repurchased, and may repurchase shares from time to\n31\ntime, which may occur before the closing. These repurchases may increase the Sellers aggregate ownership percentage in the combined company up to approximately 33% after completion of the repurchase plan.\nIn connection with the pending Acquisition, Bunge and each of Glencore and CPP Investments will execute the Shareholder Agreements. Each Shareholder’s Agreement provides each of Glencore and CPP Investments the right to designate (a) two persons to be nominated for election to Board, as long as such Seller maintains beneficial ownership of at least 10% of the registered shares; and (b) one person to be nominated for election to the Board, as long as such Seller maintains beneficial ownership of at least 5% of the registered shares. The Shareholder Agreements will become effective at the closing of the Acquisition.\nGlencore and CPP Investments may be able to influence the composition of the Board and thus, potentially, the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as statutory mergers or the issuance of new shares where preemptive rights of shareholders are to be withdrawn, which require the affirmative vote of a majority of two-thirds of the voting rights represented at the general meeting of shareholders. This concentration of investment and voting power, in addition to our current concentration of investment and voting power among certain large shareholders, could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to Bunge and its shareholders, which could adversely affect the market price of registered shares."

We rely on certain key information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data and services for internal and external users, including procurement and inventory management, transaction processing, financial, commercial and operational data, human resources management, legal and tax compliance, and other information and processes necessary to operate and manage our business.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program monitors our systems and networks for threats, breaches, intrusions and other weaknesses; assesses the security of our company-wide software, applications and systems; conducts security audits and threat assessments; responds to cybersecurity incidents; and facilitates training for our employees. Within our cybersecurity team, subject matter experts regularly obtain cybersecurity certifications. Our program includes procedures to identify cybersecurity risks and threats of our third-party service providers. These procedures measure the maturity of third-party provider cybersecurity programs against industry best practices. The collection of this information is used to assess the use of third-party software or partnerships. We also review the cybersecurity scores of our business customers and suppliers, and we rely on consultants and other third-party advisors to conduct security assessments and independent audits of the security and resilience of our systems and networks. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes response plans that are aligned with our crisis response plans and outline the procedures and protocols to follow when a cybersecurity incident has or may have occurred, including to allow assessments related to disclosure and notice requirements to be timely made to regulators and affected parties. The response plan includes protocols to notify our Chief Technology Officer (\"CTO\"), our Chief Legal Officer, other members of senior management as appropriate, and, under certain circumstances, the Audit Committee of our Board, or our full Board as appropriate.\nWe have integrated cybersecurity risk assessments into Bunge’s overall enterprise risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture of cybersecurity risk management. Our CRO formulates periodic reports and provides them to our Management Risk Committee (\"MRC\"). As noted in \"Item 1. Business - Risk Management\", the MRC reviews key enterprise risks on an ongoing basis and is responsible for reviewing and monitoring key exposures, emerging risks, and drivers of risk.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cybersecurity attacks, including those tied to global conflicts, pose a potentially significant risk to the security of our information technology systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the confidential data of our employees, customers, suppliers, and other third parties that we may hold. Although, to date, we have not experienced a material cybersecurity incident resulting in a significant interruption of our operations, the scope of any future incident cannot be predicted with any meaningful accuracy. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information.\n32\nGovernance\nOur CTO leads our Business Technology organization and our cybersecurity risk management program in coordination with our CRO. The Business Technology team is responsible for assessing, identifying, and managing risks from cybersecurity threats. Our CTO and CRO regularly receive briefings on cybersecurity matters, and in turn our CTO regularly reports to the Audit Committee on such matters. Our CRO regularly reports on enterprise risks facing the Company to the ERMC. Our CTO has more than 20 years of experience in leading, managing, and transforming information technology systems for large, global organizations, and our CRO has several years of experience in leading and managing risk oversight for global organizations.\nOur Board oversees Bunge’s approach to risk management. Our Board has established a dedicated Board committee, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, which enables greater focus at the Board level on risk oversight tailored to our business and industries. Additionally, each of our other Board committees is responsible for considering risks within its area of responsibility. The Board has delegated oversight and review of risks related to cybersecurity and information technology systems to the Audit Committee.\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and assessing the overall cybersecurity risk management program and management’s processes and policies with respect to cybersecurity risk monitoring, identification, assessment, and response. Senior management and the Audit Committee receive at least quarterly updates on Bunge's cybersecurity readiness and the current \"threat environment,\" which includes an update on the cybersecurity threat landscape, the strategic priorities of the cybersecurity risk management program and progress made in respect of those priorities, a review of cybersecurity incidents, as well as additional updates on an as-needed basis. Our internal audit team also reports to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of management in identifying and appropriately controlling risks, including cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee regularly reports on its activities to the full Board to promote effective coordination and to ensure that the entire Board remains apprised of the effectiveness of the cybersecurity risk management and the cybersecurity risk landscape, and also assesses how management is managing these risks."

Any future determination to pay dividend distributions will, subject to the provisions of applicable law, be at the discretion of the Board and the approval by shareholders at a general meeting in accordance with Swiss law and will depend upon then existing\n34\nconditions, including our financial condition, results of operations, contractual and other relevant legal or regulatory restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors the Board deems relevant.\nWe paid quarterly dividends on Bunge Limited common shares of $0.625 per share in the first and second quarters of 2023, and $0.6625 per share in the third quarter of 2023. We paid quarterly dividends on the Bunge Global registered shares of $0.6625 per share in the fourth quarter of 2023. We paid quarterly dividends on the common shares of $0.625 per share in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, and $0.525 per share in the first and second quarters of 2022. On October 31, 2023, we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.6625 per common share payable on March 1, 2024 to shareholders of record on February 16, 2024.\n(d)\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe following table sets forth certain information, as of December 31, 2023, with respect to our equity compensation plans.\n(1)\nIncludes our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, and 2017 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”). In connection with the Redomestication, effective as of November 1, 2023, Bunge amended the Plans to provide for the issuance of registered shares instead of common shares in connection with the awards under the Plans. Additionally, the amendments to the Plans include changes to comply with Swiss law regarding minimum payment for shares, share sourcing, the form of shares, data protection, and forfeiture of restricted shares along with modifying the vesting provision on the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Equity Plan for separation.\n(2)\nIncludes non-statutory stock options outstanding as to 1,691,109 registered shares, performance-based restricted stock unit awards as to 674,404 registered shares, and 1,149,459 unvested and time-based restricted stock units outstanding (including dividend equivalents payable in shares) under our Plans noted in (1) above. Dividend equivalent payments that are credited to each participant’s account are paid in our shares at the time the award is settled.\n(3)\nCalculated based on non-statutory stock options outstanding under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and 2009 Equity Incentive Plan. This number excludes outstanding time-based restricted stock unit awards, performance-based restricted stock unit awards, and deferred restricted stock unit awards under our Plans noted in (1) above.\n(4)\nShares available under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan may be used for any type of award authorized under the plan. Awards under the plan may be in the form of statutory or non-statutory stock options, restricted stock units (including performance-based), or other awards that are based on the value of our registered shares. Our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan provides that the maximum number of registered shares issuable under the plan is 10,900,000, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the plan. Our 2017 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan provides that the maximum number of registered shares issuable under the plan may not exceed 320,000, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the plan. No additional awards may be granted under the 2009 Bunge Equity Incentive Plan.\n35\n(e)\nPerformance Graph\nThe performance graph shown below compares the quarterly change in cumulative total shareholder return on our shares with the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Stock Index and the S&P Food Products Index from December 31, 2018 through the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The graph sets the beginning value of our shares and the indices at $100 and assumes that all dividends are reinvested. All index values are weighted by the capitalization of the companies included in the index.\nNote: Prepared by Zacks Investment Research, Inc. Used with permission. All rights reserved.

All rights reserved.\n(f)\nPurchases of Equity Securities by Registrant and Affiliated Purchasers\nOn June 12, 2023, Bunge Limited's Board approved the expansion of an existing $500 million program for the repurchase of our issued and outstanding common shares. At the time, approximately $300 million of capacity for the repurchase of Bunge Limited common shares remained available under the existing program and Bunge Limited's Board approved the expansion of the program by an additional $1.7 billion, for an aggregate unutilized capacity of $2.0 billion at June 12, 2023. The program continues to have an indefinite term. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Bunge repurchased 5,407,861 shares for $600 million. As of December 31, 2023, 7,516,976 shares were repurchased for $800 million and\n$1.4 billion remained outstanding for repurchases under the program. In 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares other than through the share repurchase program.\nSubsequent to the consolidated balance sheet date, from December 31, 2023 through February 21, 2024, Bunge repurchased an additional 3,319,987 shares for $301 million. Therefore, as of February 21, 2024, 10,836,963 shares were repurchased for $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion remains outstanding for repurchases under the program.\n36\nThe following table is a summary of purchases of equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2023 by Bunge and any of its affiliated purchasers.\nAny repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of means, including in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or through other means as determined by us, and in compliance with applicable legal requirements. The timing and number of any shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including share price and market conditions, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.\n(g)\nSwiss Tax Consequences to Our Shareholders\nThe tax consequences discussed below are not a complete analysis or description of all the possible tax consequences that may be relevant to you. You should consult your own tax advisor in respect of the tax consequences related to receipt, ownership, purchase or sale or other disposition of registered shares and the procedures for claiming a refund of withholding tax.\nSwiss Income Tax on Dividends and Similar Distributions\nA non-Swiss holder will not be subject to Swiss income taxes on dividend income and similar distributions in respect of registered shares, unless the shares are attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business maintained in Switzerland by such non-Swiss holder. However, dividends and similar distributions are subject to Swiss withholding tax. See “— Swiss Withholding Tax — Distributions to Shareholders” below.\nSwiss Wealth Tax\nA non-Swiss holder will not be subject to Swiss wealth taxes unless the holder’s registered shares are attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business maintained in Switzerland by such non-Swiss holder.\nSwiss Capital Gains Tax upon Disposal of Registered Shares\nA non-Swiss holder will not be subject to Swiss income taxes for capital gains unless the holder’s shares are attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business maintained in Switzerland by such non-Swiss holder. In such case, the non-Swiss holder is required to recognize capital gains or losses on the sale of such shares, which will be subject to cantonal, communal and federal income tax.\nSwiss Withholding Tax — Distributions to Shareholders\nA Swiss withholding tax of 35% is due on dividends and similar distributions to Bunge Global shareholders from Bunge Global out of available earnings or other non-qualifying reserves for withholding tax purposes, regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder (subject to the exceptions discussed under “— Exemption from Swiss Withholding Tax — Distributions to Shareholders” below). Bunge Global will be required to withhold at such rate and remit on a net basis any payments made to a holder of registered shares and pay such withheld amounts to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. See “— Refund of Swiss Withholding Tax on Dividends and Other Distributions” below.\nExemption from Swiss Withholding Tax — Distributions to Shareholders\nDistributions to shareholders in relation to a reduction of par value and distributions to shareholders out of qualifying capital contribution reserves recognized by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration are exempt from the Swiss withholding tax. Bunge Global expects to pay distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves recognized by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration for the foreseeable future, and as a result, any such distributions to shareholders will be exempt from the Swiss withholding tax.\n37\nRepurchases of Shares\nRepurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to the 35% Swiss withholding tax. However, for shares repurchased for capital reduction, the portion of the repurchase price attributable to the par value and to the qualifying contribution reserves recognized by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax. Bunge Global would be required to withhold at such rate the tax from the difference between the repurchase price and the related amount of par value and qualifying contribution reserves. Bunge Global would be required to remit on a net basis the purchase price with the Swiss withholding tax deducted to a holder of registered shares and pay the withholding tax to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.\nWith respect to the refund of Swiss withholding tax from the repurchase of shares, see “—\nRefund of Swiss Withholding Tax on Dividends and Other Distributions\n” below.\nIn many instances, Swiss companies listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange carry out share repurchase programs through a “second trading line” on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Swiss institutional investors typically purchase shares from shareholders on the open market and then sell the shares on the second trading line back to the company. The Swiss institutional investors are generally able to receive a full refund of the withholding tax. Due to, among other things, the time delay between the sale to the company and the institutional investors’ receipt of the refund, the price companies pay to repurchase their shares has historically been slightly higher (but less than 1.0%) than the price of such companies’ shares in ordinary trading on the SIX Swiss Exchange first trading line.\nWe do not expect to use the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line process to repurchase our shares because we do not intend to list our shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange. We may, however, follow an alternative process whereby we expect to be able to repurchase our shares in a manner that should allow Swiss institutional market participants selling the shares to us to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax and, therefore, accomplish the same purpose as share repurchases on the second trading line at substantially the same cost to us and such market participants as share repurchases on a second trading line.\nThe repurchase of shares for purposes other than capital reduction, such as to retain as treasury shares for use in connection with equity incentive plans, convertible debt or other instruments within certain periods, will generally not be subject to Swiss withholding tax. However, see “Comparison of Rights of Shareholders” in the Definitive Proxy Statement for a discussion on the limitations on the amount of repurchased shares that can be held as treasury shares.\nRefund of Swiss Withholding Tax on Dividends and Other Distributions\nThe Swiss-U.S. tax treaty provides that U.S. residents eligible for benefits under the treaty can seek a refund of the Swiss withholding tax on dividends for the portion exceeding 15% (leading to a refund of 20%) or a 100% refund in the case of qualified pension funds. Please see “— U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Redomestication — U.S. Holders — Taxation of Distributions on the Registered Shares” in the Definitive Proxy Statement.\nAs a general rule, the refund will be granted under the treaty if the U.S. resident can show evidence of:\n•\nbeneficial ownership,\n•\nU.S. residency, and\n•\nmeeting the U.S.-Swiss tax treaty’s limitation on benefits requirements.\nThe claim for refund must be filed with the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (Eigerstrasse 65, 3003 Berne, Switzerland), not later than December 31 of the third year following upon the calendar year in which the dividend payments became due. The relevant Swiss tax form is Form 82C for companies, 82E for other entities and 82I for individuals. These forms can be obtained from any Swiss Consulate General in the United States or from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration at the address mentioned above or online. Each form needs to be filled out in triplicate, with each copy duly completed and signed before a notary public in the United States. You must also include evidence that the withholding tax was withheld at the source.\nSwiss Transfer Stamp Tax in Relation to the Transfer of Registered Shares\nThe purchase or sale of registered shares may be subject to Swiss Transfer Stamp Tax which is due on the transfer of taxable securities (as defined in the Swiss Federal Stamp Tax Act) irrespective of the place of residency of the purchaser or seller if a Swiss bank or other Swiss securities dealers (as defined in the Swiss Federal Stamp Tax Act of 1973 ) participate to the transaction as contracting parties or as intermediaries. The applicable stamp tax rate is 0.075% for each of the two parties to a transaction (i.e., 0.15% in total) and is calculated based on the purchase price or sale proceeds. If the transaction does not involve cash consideration, the transfer stamp duty is computed on the basis of the market value of the consideration. No Swiss Transfer Stamp Tax will be due if no Swiss bank or other Swiss securities dealers (as defined in the Swiss Federal Stamp Tax Act) is involved in a purchase or sale.\n38"

    "text": "The following should be read in conjunction with \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor a comparison of results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Bunge Limited's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023.\nOperating Results\nFactors Affecting Operating Results\nBunge Global SA, a Swiss company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global agribusiness and food company with integrated operations that stretch from farmer to consumer. The commodity nature of the Company's principal products, as well as regional and global supply and demand variations that occur as an inherent part of the business, make volumes an important operating measure. Accordingly, information is included in \"\nSegment Overview and Results of Operations\n\" that summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment. The common unit of measure for all reported volumes is metric tons.\nAgribusiness\nIn the Agribusiness segment, we purchase, store, transport, process, and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products. Profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy, transportation, and logistics services. Profitability in our processing operations is also impacted by volumes procured, processed, and sold and by capacity utilization rates. Availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors, including weather, farmer planting and selling decisions, plant diseases, governmental policies, and agricultural sector economic conditions. Reported Processing volumes comprise oilseed volumes crushed (processed) during a period, which approximate sales volumes to third parties during the same period. Reported Merchandising volumes represent sales volumes to third-party customers.\nDemand for our purchased and processed Agribusiness products is affected by many factors, including global and regional economic conditions, changes in per capita income, the financial condition of our customers and their access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, particularly pork and poultry, population growth rates, relative prices of substitute agricultural products, outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry, and demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products.\nWe expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our Agribusiness products for the foreseeable future. We also expect that, from time to time, imbalances will likely exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions, which impacts our decisions regarding whether, when, and where to purchase, store, transport, process or sell these commodities, including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity.\nAdditionally, price fluctuations and availability of commodities may cause fluctuations in our working capital, reflected in the level of inventories, accounts receivable, and outstanding borrowings over the course of a given year. For example, increased availability of commodities at harvest times often causes fluctuations in our inventories and borrowings. Increases in agricultural commodity prices will also generally cause our cash flow requirements to increase as our operations require increased use of cash and associated borrowings to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange-traded futures that we use to hedge our physical inventories.\nRefined and Specialty Oils\nIn the Refined and Specialty Oils segment, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials such as crude vegetable oils, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita income, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions, and the general competitive environment in our markets. Raw material inputs to our production processes in the Refined and Specialty Oils segment are largely sourced at market prices from our Agribusiness segment. Reported volumes in this segment reflect sales volumes to third-party customers. The unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.\n39\nMilling\nIn the Milling segment, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials such as grains, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita income, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. Raw material inputs to our production processes in the  Milling segment are largely sourced at market prices from our Agribusiness segment. Reported volumes in this segment reflect feedstock ground (processed) during a period, again approximating sales volumes during the same period. The unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.\nSugar and Bioenergy\nOur Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily comprises our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP. BP Bunge Bioenergia operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North, and Midwest regions of Brazil. We account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our reported Sugar and Bioenergy results include our share of the net earnings in BP Bunge Bioenergia. While we are committed to supporting the growth and development of BP Bunge Bioenergia, our long-term goal is to seek strategic opportunities for our investment in the joint venture.\nProfitability of this segment, the value of our investment, and the timing of distributions we receive, if any, are affected by the profitability of the joint venture. In turn, the profitability of the joint venture is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane, which impacts capacity utilization rates and the amount of sugar that can be extracted from the sugarcane, and by market prices of sugar and ethanol. The availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors, including weather, geographical factors such as soil quality and topography, and agricultural practices. Once planted, sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years, but the yield decreases with each subsequent harvest. As a result, the current optimum economic cycle is generally five to seven consecutive harvests, depending on location. The joint venture owns and/or has partnership agreements to manage farmland on which it grows and harvests sugarcane and also purchases sugarcane from third parties. Prices of sugarcane in Brazil are established by Consecana, the state of São Paulo sugarcane, sugar, and ethanol council, and are based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol. Demand for the joint venture's products is affected by many factors, including changes in global or regional economic conditions, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, population growth rates, changes in per capita income, and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities, including sugarcane.\nIn addition to these industry related factors which impact our business areas, our results of operations in all business areas and segments are affected by the following factors:\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nDue to the global nature of our operations, our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. Both translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results. On a monthly basis, for subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar, subsidiary statements of income and cash flows must be translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted-average exchange rates in each monthly period. As a result, fluctuations of local currencies compared to the U.S. dollar during each monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each reported period (per quarter and year-to-date) and also affect comparisons between those reported periods. Subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nAdditionally, we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity. These amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity's statement of income and, therefore, in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net.\nWe primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries. Intercompany loans that are of a long-term investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. In contrast, foreign currency translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net.\n40\nIncome Taxes\nAs a Swiss corporation, we are subject to corporate income tax at federal, cantonal and communal levels on our Swiss income. Qualifying net dividend income and net capital gains on the sale of qualifying investments in subsidiaries are effectively exempt from federal, cantonal and communal corporate income tax. Consequently, we expect dividends from our subsidiaries and capital gains from sales of investments in our subsidiaries to be exempt from Swiss corporate income tax.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries, which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The jurisdictions that significantly impact our effective tax rate are Brazil, the United States, Argentina and Switzerland. Determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nTotal segment earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") is an operating performance measure used by Bunge’s management to evaluate segment operating activities. Bunge also uses Core Segment EBIT, Non-core Segment EBIT, Corporate and Other EBIT, and Total Segment EBIT to evaluate segment operating performance of Bunge’s Core reportable segments, Non-core reportable segments, and Total reportable segments together with Corporate and Other. Core Segment EBIT is the aggregate of the EBIT of each of Bunge’s Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments. Non-core Segment EBIT is the EBIT of Bunge’s Sugar & Bioenergy segment. Total Segment EBIT is the aggregate of the EBIT of Bunge’s Core and Non-core reportable segments, together with Corporate and Other. Bunge’s management believes Core Segment EBIT, Non-core Segment EBIT, Corporate and Other EBIT, and Total Segment EBIT are useful measures of operating profitability since the measures allow for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to financing methods or capital structure. In addition, EBIT is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge’s industry. Total Segment EBIT is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace Net income attributable to Bunge, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Further, Total Segment EBIT excludes EBIT attributable to noncontrolling interests and is not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net income or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP. See the reconciliation of Net income attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT below.\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted is calculated by including the Proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables with Cash provided by (used for) operating activities. Cash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace Cash provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Our management believes presentation of this measure allows investors to view our cash generating performance using the same measure that management uses in evaluating financial and business performance and trends. Calculation of the measure, including Proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables, was affected by the November 2022 securitization program change described in\nNote 4 - Trade Accounts Receivable and Trade Receivables Securitization.\n2023 Overview\nNet Income Attributable to Bunge -\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Net income attributable to Bunge was $2,243 million, an increase of $633 million compared to a Net income attributable to Bunge of $1,610 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher Segment EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, partially offset by lower EBIT in our Corporate and Other activities, as further discussed in the\nSegment Overview and Results of Operations\nsection below, and increased income tax expense.\nEarnings Per Share - Diluted -\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Net income attributable to Bunge shareholders, diluted, was $14.87 per share, an increase of $4.36 per share, compared to $10.51 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nEBIT\n- For the year ended December 31, 2023, Total Segment EBIT was $3,333 million, an increase of $1,002 million compared to EBIT of $2,331 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in Total Segment EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to higher Segment EBIT in our Core and Non-core segments, partially offset by lower Segment EBIT in our Corporate and Other activities, as further discussed in the\nSegment Overview and Results of Operations\nsection below, and which also provides a reconciliation of Net income attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT.\nIncome Tax Expense -\nIncome tax expense was $714 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to income tax expense of $388 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher pre-tax income and earnings mix, partially offset by $90 million of net benefit related to tax credits granted in Switzerland.\n41\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n– At December 31, 2023, working capital, which equals Total current assets less Total current liabilities, was $8,663 million, an increase of $1,505 million, compared to working capital of $7,158 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in working capital was primarily due to higher Cash and cash equivalents balances as well as lower Trade accounts payable and Current portion of long-term debt balances, driven by strong operating cash flows, partially offset by lower Inventories driven by lower average commodity prices partially offset by higher volumes.\nSegment Overview and Results of Operations\nOur operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable segments based upon their similar economic characteristics, nature of products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. We further organize these reportable segments into Core operations and Non-core operations. Core operations comprise our Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments. Non-core operations comprise our Sugar & Bioenergy segment, which itself primarily comprises the Company’s 50% interest in the net earnings of BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP.\nOur remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to our individual reportable segments because the operating performance of each reportable segment is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance activities, and trade receivables securitization program, as well as certain income tax assets and liabilities.\nA reconciliation of Net income attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT follows:\n42\nCore Segments\nAgribusiness Segment\n2023 Compared to 2022\nAgribusiness segment Net sales decreased 10% to $42,764 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to the following:\n•\nIn Processing, Net sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower average sales prices experienced in almost all regions for our global soybean oilseed processing businesses and our Europe softseed business. Lower average sales prices resulted from a reduction in the current year relative to the higher price environment in the prior year following the onset of the Ukraine-Russia war. Also contributing to the decrease in Net sales was lower volumes resulting primarily from decreased sales in Argentina due to the drought experienced in the region in the current year. The above decreases were partially offset by higher volumes in our global soybean oilseed processing business as a result of strong demand in both China and North America and increased activity in our Europe softseed business in the last half of 2023 at our Ukrainian facilities, which more than offset the reduction due to the sale of our Russian Oilseed Processing business in the first quarter of 2023.\n•\nIn Merchandising, Net sales decreased 23%, primarily due to lower average sales prices in our global corn, wheat, and oil businesses, as a result of higher global commodity prices in the prior year following the onset of the Ukraine-Russia war, which exacerbated an already tight commodity supply environment. Volumes were also down due to decreased demand in our global corn and oil businesses. Net sales were down in our ocean freight business due to lower prices and stabilizing demand. The above decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes in our global wheat business, as a result of the partial resumption of operations in Ukraine.\nCost of goods sold decreased 13%, to $39,443 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the following:\n•\nIn Processing, Cost of goods sold decreased 9% due to lower Net sales, favorable mark-to-market results, lack of recurring prior year losses in relation to the Ukraine-Russia war and impairment of the Russian business upon classification as held-for-sale, and an $18 million benefit in the current year from the recognition of mark-to-market gains on the recovery of inventories in Ukraine, partially offset by a current year $37 million fixed asset impairment charge in North America.\n•\nIn Merchandising, Cost of goods sold decreased by 22% due to lower Net sales, lack of recurring losses in relation to the Ukraine-Russia war and a $11 million benefit in the current year from the recognition of mark-to-market gains related to the recovery of inventories in Ukraine primarily from our Mykolaiv facility, partially offset by unfavorable mark-to-market results.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased 11%, to $592 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increased personnel costs and higher costs as a result of inflationary pressures, partially offset by favorable currency movements, primarily from the weakening Argentine\npeso\n.\n43\nOther income (expense) - net increased 288%, to income of $126 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to expense of $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to gains in Argentina related to foreign currency positioning and positive results in our Bunge Financial Services business compared to prior year losses on marketable securities and other short-term investments with exposures to Ukraine, following the onset of the Ukraine-Russia war.\nIncome from affiliates decreased 99% to income of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to income of $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to results from equity method investments in South America resellers.\nSegment EBIT increased 62% to $2,786 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n•\nIn Processing, an increase of 121% was primarily due to higher Gross profit driven by improved margins in our Europe softseed business, our global oilseed processing businesses, and our North America oilseed processing business, and higher Other income (expense) - net, partially offset by higher SG&A expense and a reduction in Income from affiliates as described above.\n•\nIn Merchandising, a decrease of 49% was primarily due to lower Gross profit, driven by lower results in our ocean freight business, and higher SG&A, partially offset by higher Other income (expense) - net, as described above.\nRefined and Specialty Oils Segment\n2023 Compared to 2022\nRefined and Specialty Oils segment Net sales decreased 13%, to $14,603 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower average sales prices in most regions, driven by prices stabilizing and increased supply. Sales volumes were also lower in most regions, driven by the 2022 partial expiration of leased capacity at the Rotterdam facility as well as the sale of our Russia operations in the first quarter of 2023.\nCost of goods sold decreased 16%, to $13,234 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Cost of goods sold was primarily due to lower average commodity prices and volumes in most regions, as described for Net sales above, a lack of a non-recurring impairment charge and employee severance expenses related to the classification of our Russian oilseed and processing business as held-for-sale in the prior period, and more favorable mark-to-market results.\nSG&A expenses increased 19%, to $425 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by accelerated amortization charges of $21 million, which included $4 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, primarily related to the discontinuance of the\nLoders Croklaan\ntrademark, as well as, higher personnel costs and higher costs as a result of inflationary pressures.\n44\nSegment EBIT increased 16% to $865 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher Gross profit driven by overall higher margins in most regions partially offset by higher SG&A, as described above.\nMilling Segment\n2023 Compared to 2022\nMilling segment Net sales decreased 21%, to $1,896 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes in our North America wheat milling business, driven by the completion of the sale of our Mexican wheat milling business in the third quarter of 2022, and our South American wheat milling business, partially offset by higher prices in the South American wheat milling business.\nCost of goods sold decreased 19%, to $1,729 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, as described for Net sales above, due to the sale of our Mexican wheat milling business in the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by unfavorable mark-to-market results compared to a strong prior year in South America during a period of high market volatility.\nSegment EBIT decreased 59% to $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower Gross profit resulting from unfavorable mark-to-market results in South America and sale of our Mexican wheat milling business in 2022, as described above.\nCorporate and Other\n45\n2023 Compared to 2022\nCorporate and Other EBIT decreased 38%, to a loss of $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by increased SG&A expense, including $114 million related to acquisition and integration costs associated with the announced acquisition agreement with Viterra as well as increased expenses associated with other growth and productivity-related initiatives and higher personnel costs as a result of inflationary pressures. Also contributing to the decrease were impairment charges of $20 million, in Other income (expense) - net, related to a long-term investment, and $16 million, in Income from affiliates, related to a minority investment in Australian Plant Proteins, a start-up manufacturer of novel protein ingredients. In addition, results in the prior year included a gain of $29 million, at Bunge's then-70% share, related to the settlement of one of the Company's international defined benefit pension plans. The decreases described above were partially offset by impairment charges in the prior year of $53 million related to the impairment of minority investments in two start-up manufacturers of novel protein ingredients, Merit Functional Foods and Australian Plant Proteins, and a $11 million impairment charge related to the classification of our Russian business as held-for-sale.\nNon-core Segment\nSugar and Bioenergy Segment\n2023 Compared to 2022\nSegment EBIT increased 56%, to $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to more favorable results from our investment in BP Bunge Bioenergia, primarily resulting from the release of a tax valuation allowance in the current period as well as higher sugar sales prices. The release of the tax valuation allowance is related to our investment in BP Bunge Bioenergia. Therefore, the tax valuation release is recorded within Income from affiliates and included in EBIT.\nInterest\n—A summary of consolidated interest income and expense follows:\n2023 Compared to 2022\nInterest income increased 108% to $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Interest expense increased 28% to $516 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Higher interest income is the result of significantly higher investments in cash equivalents in the current year and higher variable interest rates. Higher interest expense is the result of higher variable interest rates on debt, as well as, $16 million in financing related fees associated with the announced Business Combination Agreement with Viterra in the current period. Partially offsetting the current period increase in interest expense is a prior year charge of $47 million resulting from the early redemption of all issued and outstanding 4.35% Senior Notes due March 2024.\n46\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur main financial objectives are to prudently manage financial risks, ensure consistent access to liquidity and minimize cost of capital in order to efficiently finance our business and maintain balance sheet strength. We generally finance our ongoing operations with cash flows generated from operations, issuances of commercial paper, borrowings under various bilateral and syndicated revolving credit facilities, term loans, and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. Acquisitions and long-lived assets are generally financed with a combination of equity and long-term debt.\nWorking Capital\n(1)\nComprises Assets held for sale and Other current assets\n(2)\nComprises Liabilities held for sale and Other current liabilities\n(3)\nWorking capital is defined as Total current assets less Total current liabilities; Current ratio represents Total current assets divided by Total current liabilities\nWorking capital was $8,663 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $1,505 million from working capital of $7,158 million at December 31, 2022.\nCash and Cash Equivalents -\nCash and cash equivalents were $2,602 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $1,498 million from $1,104 million at December 31, 2022. Cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity, and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions. Cash balances are typically invested in short-term deposits with highly-rated financial institutions, in U.S. government securities and A-1/P-1 commercial papers. Please refer to the Cash Flows section of this report, below, for details regarding the primary factors giving rise to the change in Cash and cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nTrade accounts receivable, net\n- Trade accounts receivable, net were $2,592 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $237 million from $2,829 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreased Net sales in the current period driven by factors described in the\nSegment Overview & Results of Operations\nabove.\nInventories -\nInventories were $7,105 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1,303 million from $8,408 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower average commodity prices relative to the prior year, partially offset by higher volumes.\nRMI comprises agricultural commodity inventories, including soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. Total RMI reported at fair value were $5,837 million and $6,680 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively (see\nNote 5- Inventories,\nto our consolidated financial statements).\nOther current assets\n- Other current assets, including Assets held for sale, were $4,051 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $366 million from $4,417 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in margin\n47\ndeposits as well as lower unrealized gains on derivative contracts, at fair value as a result of volatile commodity prices, a decrease in Assets held for sale due to the completion of the sale of our Russian operations in the first quarter of 2023 (see\nNote 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions,\nto our consolidated financial statements), partially offset by an increase in secured advances to suppliers, net and prepaid commodity contracts.\nShort-term debt\n- Short-term debt, including the Current portion of long-term debt, was $802 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $590 million from $1,392 million at December 31, 2022. The lower Short-term debt level at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 is primarily due to the repayment of 1.85% Senior Notes -\nEuro\nin June 2023 partially offset by higher borrowings by Bunge operating companies on local bank lines of credit.\nTrade accounts payable\n- Trade accounts payable were $3,664 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $722 million from $4,386 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in Trade accounts payable was primarily due to lower average inventory purchase prices during the current year.\nOther current liabilities\n- Other current liabilities, including Liabilities held for sale, were $2,913 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $484 million from $3,397 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower unrealized losses on derivative contracts, as a result of volatile commodity prices, and lower advances on sales during the current period due to a reduction in commodity prices, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities driven by increased acquisition and integration costs as well as higher income tax payable.\nDebt\nFinancing Arrangements and Outstanding Indebtedness\n— Prior to June 21, 2023, we conducted most of our third-party financing activities through a centralized financing structure that provided the Company with efficient access to debt and capital markets. This structure included a master trust (the \"Bunge Master Trust\"), the primary assets of which comprised intercompany loans made to Bunge Limited and its subsidiaries. Certain of Bunge Limited’s 100% owned finance subsidiaries, including Bunge Limited Finance Corp., Bunge Finance Europe B.V., and Bunge Asset Funding Corp., funded the Bunge Master Trust with short and long-term debt obtained from third parties, including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities, as well as the issuance of senior notes. Borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full, unconditional guarantees by Bunge Limited or Bunge Global SA.\nOn June 21, 2023, Bunge Limited and its finance subsidiaries terminated the Bunge Master Trust in accordance with a termination and lien release agreement in order to simplify the legal framework around its capital structure (see\nNote 17- Short-term Debt and Credit Facilities\n). In connection with the termination of the Bunge Master Trust, Bunge amended its existing credit agreements and related guarantees to remove all references and provisions related to the Bunge Master Trust. The amendments also resulted in Bunge Limited’s obligations as the existing guarantor being automatically assigned to Bunge Global SA, the new Swiss holding company, as successor guarantor, effective November 1, 2023, the completion date of the Redomestication.\nOn June 21, 2023, we also terminated our then existing $600 million asset-backed commercial paper program and the related liquidity and letter of credit facilities as well as established a new $1 billion unsecured corporate commercial paper program (the \"$1 Billion Commercial Paper Program\").\nRevolving Credit Facilities\n—At December 31, 2023, we had $5,665 million unused and available committed borrowing capacity comprising committed revolving credit facilities. The following table summarizes these facilities for the years presented:\n(1)\nSee\nNote 17- Short-term Debt and Credit Facilities\nfor further information on these programs.\n48\n(2)\nThe short-term credit ratings of the new $1 Billion Commercial Paper Program (see\nNote 17- Short-term Debt and Credit Facilities\nfor further details on program) require Bunge to keep same day unused committed borrowing capacity under its long-term committed credit facilities in an amount greater or equal to the amount of commercial paper issued and outstanding.\nShort and long-term debt\n—Our short and long-term debt increased by $231 million to $4,882 million at December 31, 2023, from $4,651 million at December 31, 2022, primarily due to the draws on our $250 Million February 2023 Delayed Draw Term Loan and $750 Million Delayed Draw Term Loan and an increase in short-term bank borrowings, offset by the repayment of the 1.85% Senior Notes -\nEuro\nin June 2023 and 5-year term loan agreement due 2024 in October 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our average short and long-term debt outstanding was approximately $5,293 million compared to approximately $5,986 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our Long-term debt outstanding balance, including the Current-portion of long-term debt, was $4,085 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $4,105 million at December 31, 2022.\nThe following table summarizes our short-term debt activity at December 31, 2023.\n(1)\nIncludes $179 million of local currency bank borrowings in certain European, South American, and Asia-Pacific countries at a weighted average interest rate of 15.30% as of December 31, 2023.\nFrom time to time, through our financing subsidiaries, we enter into bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on our financing requirements. At December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines. In addition, Bunge's operating companies had $797 million and $546 million in short-term borrowings outstanding from local bank lines of credit at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to support working capital requirements.\nAs described in\nNote 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions\n, we have secured a total of $8.0 billion in acquisition financing in the form of a $7.7 billion financing commitment from a consortium of lenders, arranged by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a $300 million 5-year delayed draw term loan from CoBank and the U.S. farm credit system executed on July 7, 2023 that may be drawn upon the closing of the Acquisition. The commitment for the $7.7 billion financing commitment is in the form of a three-tranche term loan maturing 364-days, 2-years and 3-years from closing of the Acquisition. We intend to use a portion of the acquisition financing to fund the cash portion of the Transaction Consideration, and the remainder for repayment of certain indebtedness of Viterra which is expected to be repaid at closing and for the ongoing operations of the combined company following closing.\n49\nThe following table summarizes our short and long-term debt:\n(1)\nIncludes secured debt of $200 million and $56 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes $179 million and $207 million of local currency borrowings in certain European, South American, and Asia-Pacific countries at a weighted average interest rate of 15.30% and 32.12% as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n(3)\nVariable interest rates are as of December 31, 2023.\n(4)\nOn October 6, 2023, Bunge prepaid and terminated its 5-year term loan agreement due in 2024.\n(5)\nUpon maturity in June 2023, Bunge repaid the principal and accrued interest due on all of the issued and outstanding 1.85% Senior Notes -\nEuro\n.\n(6)\nIncludes secured debt of $100 million and $21 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nCredit Ratings\n—Bunge's debt ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies at December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n(1)\nShort-term debt rating applies only to $1 Billion Commercial Paper Program with Bunge Limited Finance Corp. as the issuer.\nFollowing the announcement of the Acquisition, all three rating agencies reviewed our credit ratings and published updated credit opinions on us, reflecting their views of the credit profile of the Company both on a current standalone basis, and a pro-forma at closing basis. Based on its review, Standard and Poor's upgraded our credit rating to BBB+ and further placed us\n50\non positive outlook for an upgrade to A-. Moody’s kept our credit rating unchanged at Baa2 and placed us on a review for upgrade to Baa1. Fitch kept our credit rating unchanged at BBB and placed us on credit watch positive for an upgrade to BBB+. We expect Standard and Poor's, Moody’s and Fitch to resolve their positive outlook, review for upgrade and credit watch positive status respectively at or before the closing date of the Acquisition, based on a variety of factors including but not limited to our operating performance, our financial position and high certainty that the Acquisition will close.\nOn June 21, 2023, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s assigned short-term ratings to the $1 Billion Commercial Paper Program of A-2 and P-2, respectively. Subsequently, on August 11, 2023, Fitch assigned F-2 rating to the program.\nOur debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt. However, credit rating downgrades would increase borrowing costs under our credit facilities and, depending on their severity, could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on competitive terms. A significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with higher credit ratings.\nOur credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants, including minimum current ratio, maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and limitations on secured indebtedness. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2023.\nTrade Receivable Securitization Program\nBunge and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a trade receivables securitization program (the \"Program\") with a financial institution, as administrative agent, and certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the \"Purchasers\"). The Program is designed to enhance our financial flexibility by providing an additional source of liquidity for our operations. As referenced in\nNote 4 - Trade Accounts Receivable and Trade Receivables Securitization Program\n, the aggregate size of the program is\n$1.5 billion, with an accordion feature of $1 billion.\nThe Program terminates on May 17, 2031; however, each committed purchaser's commitment to purchase trade receivables under the Program will terminate on December 17, 2024, with a feature that permits us to request 364-day extensions.\nThe Program’s current pledge structure results from a November 16, 2022 amendment which replaced the existing DPP structure. Under the new structure, Bunge Securitization B.V. (\"BSBV\"), a consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, transfers certain trade receivables to the Purchasers in exchange for a cash payment up to the aggregate size of the Program. Bunge also retains ownership of a population of unsold receivables. BSBV agrees to guaranty the collection of sold receivables and grants a lien to the administrative agent on all unsold receivables. Collections on unsold receivables and guarantee payments are classified as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Previously, under the DPP structure, we reflected cash flows related to the DPP as investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nUnder the Program’s previous structure, Bunge's risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables was limited to the DPP, included in Other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The DPP was repaid in cash as receivables were collected, generally within 30 days. Under the amended structure, Bunge’s risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables is substantially the same and limited to the assets of BSBV, primarily comprised of unsold receivables pledged to the administrative agent.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nWe may use interest rate swaps in hedge accounting relationships and record the swaps at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings. Additionally, the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates. See\nNote 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nto our consolidated financial statements.\n51\nEquity\nTotal equity is set forth in the following table:\n(1)\nIn connection with the Redomestication described in\nNote 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies\n, 8,102,179 shares held in treasury with an acquisition cost of $845 million were cancelled to comply with the Swiss Code limitation on issuer’s holding of registered share capital.\nTotal Bunge shareholders' equity was $10,851 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $9,224 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in Bunge shareholders' equity during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to $2,243 million of Net income attributable to Bunge, $317 million of Other comprehensive income, as described in\nNote 23- Equity\n, $69 million of share-based compensation expense partially offset by $600 million of share repurchases, as described in\nNote 23- Equity,\nand $386 million of declared dividends to shareholders.\nNoncontrolling interests increased to $963 million at December 31, 2023 from $732 million at December 31, 2022 primarily due to $95 million of Net income attributable to our noncontrolling interest entities, $91 million related to the acquisition of noncontrolling interest in Terminal de Granéis de Santa Catarina (\"TGSC\") (see\nNote 11- Investments in Affiliates and Variable Interest Entities\nfor further details), and $56 million of contributions from noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $17 million of dividends paid to noncontrolling interest holders.\nShare repurchase program\n- As noted in\nNote 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions,\non June 12, 2023, Bunge Limited's Board approved the expansion of the existing $500 million program for the repurchase of our issued and outstanding common shares. At the time, approximately $300 million of capacity for the repurchase of Bunge Limited common shares remained available under the existing program and Bunge Limited's Board approved the expansion of the program by an additional $1.7 billion, for an aggregate unutilized capacity of $2.0 billion at June 12, 2023. The program continues to have an indefinite term. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Bunge repurchased 5,407,861 shares for $600 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 7,516,976 shares were repurchased for $800 million and\n$1.4 billion remained outstanding for repurchases under the program.\nSubsequent to the consolidated balance sheet date, from December 31, 2023 through February 21, 2024, Bunge repurchased an additional 3,319,987 shares for $301 million. Therefore, as of February 21, 2024, 10,836,963 shares were repurchased for $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion remains outstanding for repurchases under the program.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows from operations vary depending on, among other items, the market prices and timing of the purchase and sale of our inventories. Generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our Agribusiness operations require\n52\nincreased use of cash to support working capital to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to minimize price risk related to the purchase and sale of our inventories.\n2023 Compared to 2022\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and cash held for sale increased $1,471 million, compared to an increase of $247 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOperating:\nCash provided by operating activities was $3,308 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $8,857 million compared to cash used for operating activities of $5,549 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to net changes in working capital, driven by lower average commodity prices, and decreased beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables, due to a change in structure of the securitization program discussed above.\n(1)\nOn November 16, 2022, Bunge and certain of its subsidiaries amended its trade receivables securitization program from a DPP structure to a pledge structure, see above for further details.\nCash provided by operating activities, including net proceeds from beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables was $3,395 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1,275 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by net working capital changes, driven by lower average commodity prices, as well as higher Net income during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCertain of our non-U.S. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with U.S. dollar-denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with U.S. dollar-denominated assets. The functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency. The financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency, translated into U.S. dollars. U.S. dollar-denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. Also, certain of our U.S. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local currency denominated assets. Local currency loans in U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries outside the U.S. are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the applicable balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net. For the year ended December 31, 2023 we recorded a foreign currency gain on net debt of $281 million versus a foreign currency gain on net debt for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $101 million, which were included as adjustments to reconcile Net income to Cash provided by (used for) operating activities in the line item \"Foreign exchange (gain) loss on net debt\" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. This adjustment is required as the gains and losses are non-cash items that arise from financing activities and therefore will have no impact on cash flows from operations.\nInvesting:\nCash used for investing activities was $1,009 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $6,499 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $7,508 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower net proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivable as a result of the change in the program structure above, and higher capital expenditures including the acquisition of the Avondale refinery. Additionally, lower proceeds were received on the sale of our Russian operations during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to proceeds received from the sale of our Mexican wheat milling business during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFinancing:\nCash used for financing activities was $856 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $87 million, compared to cash used for financing activities of $769 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we received net cash proceeds from short-term and long-term debt of $200 million, primarily from delayed term draw loans of $750 million and $250 million as well as increased short term bank borrowings, offset by the repayment of the 1.85% Senior Notes -\nEuro\nin June 2023 and a 5-year loan agreement due in 2024, repurchased $600 million of common shares, and paid $383 million in dividend payments to common shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we made net cash repayments from short-term and long-term debt of $708 million, paid $349 million in dividends to our common and preference shareholders, repurchased $200 million of common shares, and paid $102 million to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest from redeemable noncontrolling interest holders in our subsidiary, Bunge Loders Croklaan Group B.V. These cash outflows were partially offset by $542 million in cash received from the sale of noncontrolling interests,\n53\nincluding upon formation of the Bunge Chevron JV, and $92 million in proceeds from the exercise of options for common shares.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur cash payments made for capital expenditures were $1,122 million and $555 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We intend to make capital expenditures in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in 2024. Our priorities for 2024 are to maintain the cash generating capacity of our assets through non-discretionary projects, such as maintenance, safety and compliance, as well as discretionary investments in growth and productivity projects, focusing on our strategy to strengthen our oilseeds platform, increase participation in biofuels and plant-based proteins, and grow our value-added oils business. These discretionary and non-discretionary capital investments will also help us achieve certain of our environmental and sustainability related objectives. We intend to fund these capital expenditures primarily with cash flows from operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGuarantees\nWe have issued or were party to the following guarantees at December 31, 2023:\n(1)\nWe have issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of our unconsolidated affiliates. The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings, which have maturity dates through 2034. There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates and in connection therewith have secured their guarantee obligations through a pledge to the financial institutions of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates' shares plus loans receivable from the unconsolidated affiliates in the event that the guaranteed obligations are enforced.\nBased on the a\nmounts drawn under guaranteed debt facilities of unconsolidated affiliates at December 31, 2023, our potential liability was\n$83 million, and less than $1 million of o\nb\nligations related to these guarantees have been recorded within Other non-current liabilities.\n(2)\nWe have issued guarantees to certain financial institutions that are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars, barges and buildings. These guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at the conclusion of the lease term. These leases expire at various dates from 2024 through 2029. At December 31, 2023, no obligation has been recorded related to these guarantees. Any obligation recorded would be re\ncognized in Current\noperating lease obligations or Non-current operating lease obligations. (see\nNote 26- Leases\n, to our consolidated financial statements).\n(3)\nOn February 3, 2023, Bunge agreed to indemnify the buyer of its Russian operations against certain existing legal claims involving Bunge's former Russian subsidiary. The indemnity expires on February 2, 2030. As of December 31, 2023, we recorded a $9 million obligation related to this indemnity within Other non-current liabilities.\n54\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations and their expected maturities at December 31, 2023, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods indicated.\n(1)\nIncludes components of long-term debt attributable to unamortized premiums of $16 million and excludes components of long-term debt attributable to fair value hedge accounting of $260 million.\n(2)\nRepresents future minimum payments under non-cancelable leases with initial terms of one year or more. Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income receipts of $115 million due in future periods under non-cancelable subleases.\n(3)\nRepresents purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and railroad freight lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. The ocean freight service agreements are short term contracts with a duration of less than a year. Ocean freight service agreements with terms in excess of one year are included in non-cancelable lease obligations. The railroad freight service agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used. The costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products. However, changes in the market value of such freight services compared to the rates at which we have contracted them may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities.\n(4)\nRepresents other purchase commitments and obligations, such as take-or-pay contracts, throughput contracts, and debt commitment fees.\n(5)\nDoes not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions. As of December 31, 2023, Bunge had uncertain income tax liabilities of $68 million, including interest and penalties. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. See\nNote 14- Income Taxes\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe expect to contribute $24 million to our defined benefit pension plans and $4 million to our postretirement benefit plans in 2024.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in\nNote 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nto our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make substantial judgment or estimation in their application that may significantly affect reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\n55\nForeign Currency Transactions and Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. The determination of functional currency may require significant judgment to identify the currency of the primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates. This may include an evaluation of a number of economic factors including, cash flow, sales price, sales market, expense, and financing indicators, as well, as the extent of the subsidiary’s intra-entity transactions. However, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, if a foreign entity's economy is determined to be highly inflationary, then such foreign entity's financial statements are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency.\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net unless the remeasurement gain or loss relates to an intercompany transaction that is of a long-term investment nature and for which settlement is neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future, in which case the remeasurement gain or loss is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAt period-end, amounts included in the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nInventories and Commodity Derivatives\nOur RMI, forward RMI purchase and sale contracts, and exchange-traded futures and options are primarily valued at fair value. RMI are freely-traded, have quoted market prices, may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs (see\nNote 5- Inventories\nto our consolidated financial statements for RMI balances as of December 31, 2023). We estimate the fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts on these inventories based on commodity futures exchange quotations, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter (\"OTC\") markets with appropriate adjustments for differences in local markets where our inventories are located. Certain inventories may utilize significant unobservable data related to local market adjustments to determine fair value. The significant unobservable inputs for RMI and physically-settled forward purchase and sale contracts relate to certain management estimates regarding transportation costs and other local market or location-related adjustments, primarily freight-related adjustments in the interior of Brazil and the lack of market corroborated information in Canada. In both situations, we use proprietary information such as purchase and sale contracts and contracted prices to value freight, premiums, and discounts in our contracts. Counterparty credit and performance risk on forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is included in the determination of fair value. From time to time, we have experienced instances of counterparty non-performance as a result of significant declines in counterparty profitability under these contracts due to movements in commodity prices between the time the contracts were executed and the contractual forward delivery period. However, based on historical experience with our suppliers and customers, our own credit risk, and knowledge of current market conditions, we do not view non-performance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of our forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.\nChanges in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of Cost of goods sold. If we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values, amounts reported as Inventories and Unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and Cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income could differ. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as Inventories, Unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, and Cost of goods sold could differ. See\nNote 15- Fair Value Measurements\nto our consolidated financial statements for further details of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts on these inventories carried at fair value.\n56\nDerivatives - Designated Hedging Activities\nWe manage currency risk on certain forecasted purchases, sales and selling, general and administrative expenses with currency forwards designated as cash flow hedges. Assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative instruments has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of earnings in the consolidated statement of income in the same caption as the hedged items when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. If it is determined that the derivative hedging instruments are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of the derivative instrument would be recorded immediately in the consolidated statements of income in the same caption as the hedged items. See\nNote 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nto our consolidated financial statements for further details and impacts of cash flow hedges on the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill\nWhen we acquire a business, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market participants, projected growth rates, the amounts and timing of future cash flows, the discount rates applied to the cash flows, and the determination of useful life of an asset.\nOur goodwill balance is not amortized to expense. Instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually. We generally perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter. If events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses, we perform an impairment analysis at that date. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant asset. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) determine our reporting units; (2) allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (3) determine the carrying value, or book value, of our reporting units; (4) estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model and/or using market multiples; (5) compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value; and (6) if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge for such amount, but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis, including the identification of our reporting units, identification and allocation of the assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units, and determination of fair value. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic impairment analysis, we make estimates and significant judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit aligned with management’s strategic business plans. Changes in judgment related to these assumptions and estimates could result in goodwill impairment charges. We believe the assumptions and estimates used are appropriate based on the information currently available to management. Estimates based on market earnings multiples of peer companies identified for the reporting unit may also be used, where available. Critical estimates in the determination of fair value under the income approach include, but are not limited to, assumptions about variables such as commodity prices, crop and related throughput and production volumes, profitability, future capital expenditures, other expenses, and discount rates, all of which are subject to a high degree of judgment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined the estimated fair values of each of our goodwill reporting units exceeded each of their carrying values by a significant amount. See\nNote 8- Goodwill,\nto our consolidated financial statements.\n57\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. Property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life on a straight line basis. When facts and circumstances indicate the carrying values of these assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the undiscounted projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets from their use and ultimate disposal. If the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount that carrying value exceeds fair value. Impairment is recognized as a charge against results of operations. Our judgments related to the expected useful lives of these assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of these assets, changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges. Please refer to\nNote 10- Impairments\nto our consolidated financial statements for details of property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nInvestments in Affiliates\nWe have investments in various unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, minus impairment. We review our investments annually or when an event or circumstances indicate that a potential decline in value may be other than temporary. We consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time the fair value of the investment is expected to be below its carrying value, the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of the affiliate, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the fair value. During the second quarter of 2023, certain of the above factors indicated an other than temporary decline in value of our investment in\nAustralia Plant Proteins (\"APP\"), a start-up manufacturer of novel protein ingredients. As a result of the impairment, there is no carrying value associated with the equity method investment in APP at December 31, 2023. Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, revenue growth, and discount rates. If we used different methods or factors to estimate fair value, the amount of recorded impairment and the carrying value of our investments could differ. Please refer to\nNote 10- Impairments\nand\nNote 11- Investments in Affiliates and Variable Interest Entities\nto our consolidated financial statements for further details.\nContingencies\nWe are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits, primarily non-income tax and labor claims in Brazil and non-income tax claims in Argentina, and we make provisions for potential liabilities arising from such claims when we deem them probable and reasonably estimable. These estimates of probable loss have been developed in consultation with in-house and outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings. For more information on tax and labor claims in Brazil, see \"Item 3.\nLegal Proceedings\n\" and\nNote 21- Commitments and Contingencies\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize. We apply a \"more likely than not\" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. We consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the amount of the valuation allowances. If we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount, we decrease the valuation allowance, thereby decreasing income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset, we increase the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income tax expense. During 2023, we increased valuation allowances by $321 million, primarily attributable to valuation allowance established on tax credits generated during the year where Bunge believes a portion of the deferred tax asset is not more likely than not to be realized.\nThe calculation of our uncertain tax positions involves complexities in the application of intricate tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Future changes in judgment related to the ultimate resolution of unrecognized tax benefits will affect the earnings in the quarter of such change. At December 31, 2023, we had recorded uncertain tax positions of $68 million in our consolidated balance sheet. For additional information on income taxes, please refer to\nNote 14- Income Taxes\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nRecoverable Taxes\nWe evaluate the collectability of our recoverable taxes and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. Recoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, raw materials and taxable services, as well as other transactional taxes, which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes, or other taxes we may owe, primarily in Brazil and Europe. Management's assumption about the collectability of recoverable\n58\ntaxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes. The balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories, purchases of new inventories, percentages of export sales, seasonality, changes in applicable tax rates, cash payments by the applicable government agencies and the offset of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments, where permissible. At December 31, 2023, the allowance for recoverable taxes was $35 million. W\ne continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases\nwhere we determine that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee\nNote 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nto our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

    "text": "Risk Management\nAs a result of our global activities, we are exposed to changes in, among other things, agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, energy costs, and inflationary pressures, which may affect our results of operations and financial position. We actively monitor and manage these various market risks associated with our business activities. Our risk management decisions take place in various locations, but exposure limits are centrally set and monitored, operating under a global governance framework. Additionally, our Board's Enterprise Risk Management Committee and our internal Management Risk Committee oversee our global market risk governance framework, including risk management policies and limits.\nWe use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, energy costs, and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures. We enter into derivative instruments primarily with commodity exchanges in the case of commodity futures and options and major financial institutions in the case of ocean freight. While these derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, for hedged exposures those fluctuations are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying exposures. The derivative instruments that we use for hedging purposes are intended to reduce the volatility of our results of operations. However, they can occasionally result in earnings volatility, which may be material. See\nNote 15- Fair Value Measurements\nand\nNote 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nto our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative instruments.\nCredit and Counterparty Risk\nThrough our normal business activities, we are subject to significant credit and counterparty risks that arise through commercial sales and purchases, including forward commitments to buy or sell, and through various OTC derivative instruments that we use to manage risks inherent in our business activities. We define credit and counterparty risk as a potential financial loss due to the failure of a counterparty to honor its obligations. The exposure is measured based upon several factors, including unpaid accounts receivable from counterparties, as well as unrealized gains from forward purchase or sale contracts and OTC derivative instruments. Credit and counterparty risk also includes sovereign credit risk. We actively monitor credit and counterparty risk through regular reviews of exposures and credit analysis by regional credit teams, as well as a review by global and corporate committees that monitor counterparty performance. We record provisions for counterparty losses from time to time as a result of our credit and counterparty analysis.\nDuring periods of tight conditions in global credit markets, downturns in regional or global economic conditions, and/or significant price volatility, credit and counterparty risks are heightened, such as during 2023 when concerns about the financial condition of a number of United States and international banking institutions developed and resulted in government and regulatory intervention. Although our counterparty risk and exposure to these financial institutions has been de minimis, we continue to monitor our exposure to all financial institution counterparties. This increased risk is monitored through, among other things, exposure reporting, increased communication with key counterparties, management reviews, and specific focus on counterparties or groups of counterparties that we may determine as high risk. We have reduced exposures and associated position limits in certain cases.\n59\nCommodities Risk\nWe operate in many areas of the food industry, from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food products. As a result, we purchase and produce various materials, many of which are agricultural commodities, including: soybeans, soybean oil, soybean meal, palm oil (from crude to various degrees of refined products), softseeds (including sunflower seed, rapeseed, and canola) and related oil and meal derived from them, wheat, barley, shea nut, and corn. Agricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors, including inflationary pressures, that may create price risk. As described above, we are also subject to the risk of counterparty non-performance under forward purchase and sale contracts. From time to time, we have experienced instances of counterparty non-performance as a result of significant declines in counterparty profitability under these contracts due to movements in commodity prices between the time the contracts were executed and the contractual forward delivery period.\nWe enter into various derivative contracts with the primary objective of managing our exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used and produced in our business operations. We have established policies that limit the amount of unhedged fixed price agricultural commodity positions permissible for our operating companies, which are generally a combination of volumetric, drawdown, and value-at-risk (\"VaR\") limits. We measure and review our commodity positions on a daily basis. We also employ stress-testing techniques in order to quantify our exposures to price and liquidity risks under non-normal or event driven market conditions.\nOur daily net agricultural commodity position consists of inventory, forward purchase and sale contracts, and OTC and exchange-traded derivative instruments, including those used to hedge portions of our production requirements. The fair value of that position is a summation of the fair values of each agricultural commodity, calculated by valuing all of our commodity positions for the period at quoted market prices, where available, or by utilizing a close proxy. VaR is calculated on the net position and monitored at the 95% confidence interval. In addition, scenario analysis and stress testing are performed. For example, one measure of market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in prices. The results of this analysis, which may differ from actual results, are as follows:\nOcean Freight Risk\nOcean freight represents a significant portion of our operating costs. The market price for ocean freight varies depending on the supply and demand for ocean vessels, global economic conditions, inflationary pressure, and other factors. We enter into time charter agreements for time on ocean freight vessels based on forecasted requirements for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. Our time charter agreements generally have terms ranging from two months to approximately two years. We use financial derivatives, generally freight forward agreements, to hedge portions of our ocean freight costs. The ocean freight derivatives are included in Other current assets and Other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.\nEnergy Risk\nWe purchase various energy commodities such as electricity, natural gas, and bunker fuel, which are used to operate our manufacturing facilities and ocean freight vessels. These energy commodities are subject to price risk, including inflationary pressures. We use financial derivatives, including exchange traded and OTC swaps and options for various purposes, to manage our exposure to volatility in energy costs and market prices. These energy derivatives are included in Other current assets and Other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.\nCurrency Risk\nOur global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets. Our primary foreign currency exposures are the Brazilian\nreal\n, Canadian\ndollar\n, the\nEuro,\nand the Chinese\nyuan/renminbi\n. To reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts, swaps, and options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the related currency exposures. The potential loss in fair value of such net currency positions resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2023, was not material.\n60\nWhen determining our exposure, we exclude intercompany loans that are deemed to be permanently invested. Repayments of permanently invested intercompany loans are neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future and are therefore treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. As a result, foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of Net income and recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Included in Other comprehensive income (loss) are foreign currency gains of $111 million and $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to permanently invested intercompany loans. Activity in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 includes reclassification of $85 million in foreign exchange losses from Other comprehensive income (loss) to Net income, net of tax of zero, related to the sale of Bunge's Russian operations. See\nNote 2 - Acquisitions and Dispositions\nto our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have debt in fixed and floating rate instruments. We are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates, including inflationary pressures. We may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure related to our debt portfolio.\nThe aggregate fair value of our short and long-term debt, based on market yields at December 31, 2023, was $4,921 million with a carrying value of $4,882 million.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the interest yields on our fixed rate debt and related interest rate swaps at December 31, 2023, would result in a less than 1% change in the fair value of our debt and interest rate swaps.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point change in the applicable reference rate, such as SOFR, would result in a change of approximately $51 million in our interest expense on our variable rate debt at December 31, 2023. Some of our variable rate debt is denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars and is indexed to non-U.S. dollar-based interest rate indices, such as EURIBOR and TLP, and certain benchmark rates in local bank markets. As such, the hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rate ignores the potential impact of any currency movements. See \"Risk Factors -\nWe are a capital intensive business and depend on cash provided by our operations as well as access to external financing to operate and grow our business\"\nfor a discussion of certain risks related to interest rates.\nInflation Risk\nInflationary factors generally affect us by increasing our labor and overhead costs, as well as costs associated with certain risks identified above, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We have historically been able to recover the impacts of inflation through sales price increases, however we cannot reasonably estimate our ability to successfully recover any impact of inflation through price increases in the future. Our inability to do so could harm our results of operations and financial position.\nDerivative Instruments\nForeign Exchange Derivatives\n—We use a combination of foreign exchange forward, swap, futures, and options contracts in certain of our operations to mitigate the risk of exchange rate fluctuations in connection with certain commercial and balance sheet exposures. The foreign exchange forward, swap and option contracts may be designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. We may also use net investment hedges to partially offset the translation adjustments arising from the remeasurement of our investment in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe assess, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items.\nInterest Rate Derivatives\n—We may enter into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of managing certain of our interest rate exposures. Interest rate swaps used by us as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings. Certain of these agreements may be designated as fair value hedges. In such instances, the carrying amount of the associated hedged debt is also adjusted through earnings for changes in fair value arising from changes in benchmark interest rates. We may also enter into interest rate basis swap agreements that do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. The impact of changes in fair value of interest rate swap agreements is primarily presented in Interest expense.\nCommodity Derivatives\n—We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices. We generally use exchange-traded futures and options contracts to minimize the effects of changes in the prices of agricultural commodities held as inventories or subject to forward purchase and sale contracts, but may also enter into OTC commodity transactions, including swaps, which are settled in cash at maturity or termination based on exchange-quoted futures prices. Changes in fair values of exchange-traded futures contracts, representing the unrealized gains\n61\nand/or losses on these instruments, are settled daily, generally through our 100% owned futures clearing subsidiary. Forward purchase and sale contracts are primarily settled through delivery of agricultural commodities. While we consider these exchange-traded futures and forward purchase and sale contracts to be effective economic hedges, we do not designate or account for the majority of our commodity contracts as hedges. Changes in fair values of these contracts and related RMI are included in Cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income. The forward contracts require performance of both us and the contract counterparty in future periods. Contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges. Contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle.\nOcean Freight Derivatives\n—We use derivative instruments referred to as freight forward agreements, or FFAs, and FFA options to hedge portions of our current and anticipated ocean freight costs. Changes in the fair values of ocean freight derivatives are recorded in Cost of goods sold.\nEnergy Derivatives\n—We use derivative instruments for various purposes, including to manage our exposure to volatility in energy costs and our exposure to market prices related to the sale of biofuels. Our operations use substantial amounts of energy, including natural gas, coal, and fuel oil, including bunker fuel. Changes in the fair values of energy derivatives are recorded in Cost of goods sold.\nOther Derivatives\n—We may also enter into other derivatives, including credit default swaps, carbon emission derivatives and equity derivatives, to manage our exposure to credit risk and broader macroeconomic risks. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.\nFor more information, see\nNote 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nto our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

    "text": "Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2023, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our \"disclosure controls and procedures,\" as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nBunge Global's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Bunge Global's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report based on the framework in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n62\nBased on this assessment, management concluded that Bunge Global's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that has audited and reported on Bunge Global's consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued its written attestation report on Bunge Global's internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. However, we continue to migrate certain processes from across our operations to shared business service models in order to consolidate back-office functions while standardizing our processes and financial systems globally. These initiatives are not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. We plan to continue these initiatives in phases over the next several years and, accordingly, we have and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. Specifically, we have continued to migrate certain of our financial reporting systems in Argentina to our South American Enterprise Resource Planning system which may result in changes to related internal controls over financial reporting.\nAdditionally, management performed an evaluation of the impacts of the Ukraine-Russia War on our internal controls over financial reporting. In doing so management noted that, as a result of the war, we are currently unable to perform certain of our Ukrainian internal controls over financial reporting, primarily relating to on-site physical inspections of inventory, due to safety concerns, particularly in areas of active conflict. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value associated with Company inventories in areas of active conflict has been substantially reserved. In response, management has implemented compensating controls, including using third-party contractors to carry out visual inspections of the physical condition of our assets held at Ukrainian facilities in non-active conflict areas.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls may also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of control effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n63\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Bunge Global SA\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Bunge Global SA and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nFebruary 22, 2024\n64"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nReadily Marketable Inventories and Physically Settled Forward Purchase and Sale Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company records agricultural commodity inventories, referred to as readily marketable inventories \"RMI\", and physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold. The Company values RMI and physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts primarily using Level 1 inputs, such as public exchange quotes of commodity futures, broker or dealer quotations. A portion of the value, however, is derived using significant unobservable inputs referred to as Level 3 inputs, such as management estimates regarding costs of transportation and other location-related adjustments in Brazil, that involve significant judgment by management.\nF-2\nAuditing the significant unobservable inputs in Brazil used by management to estimate the fair value of RMI and physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts involved judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the significant unobservable inputs in Brazil used by management to estimate the fair value of RMI and physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s review of the underlying assumptions used in the Company’s process of estimating the fair value of RMI and physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts, including those over Level 3 inputs.\n•\nWe evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of the Company’s methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of RMI and physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts.\n•\nWe evaluated the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of our specialists used to estimate the fair value of RMI and physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate fair value by comparing management’s historical estimates to subsequent transactions, considering changes in market conditions subsequent to year-end.\n•\nWe made selections of RMI and physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts to test Level 3 inputs and performed the following:\n◦\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of the Level 3 inputs by reference to third-party data, information produced by the entity, and inquires of management.\n◦\nWe searched for contradictory evidence to Level 3 inputs based on our knowledge of the commodities market and inquiries of management.\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nFebruary 22, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\nF-3\nPART I—FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nITEM 1.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(U.S. dollars in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-4\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(U.S. dollars in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-5\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(U.S. dollars in millions, except share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-6\nBUNGE\nGLOBAL SA\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(U.S. dollars in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-7\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY AND REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n(U.S. dollars in millions, except share data)\nF-8\nF-9\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-10\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nNATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business\n—On November 1, 2023, Bunge Global SA completed the change of jurisdiction of incorporation of its group holding company from Bermuda to Switzerland (the \"Redomestication\"). The Redomestication, as approved by our shareholders, was effected pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Bermuda law.\nEach common share of Bunge Limited, par value $\n0.01\nper share, was cancelled in exchange for an equal number of registered shares of Bunge Global SA, par value $\n0.01\nper share (the \"registered shares\"). The registered shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") under the symbol \"BG\" on November 1, 2023, which is the same symbol under which the Bunge Limited shares were previously traded. References to the term \"shares\" refer to Bunge Limited common shares prior to the Redomestication and to Bunge Global SA registered shares after the Redomestication, unless otherwise specified. See\nNote 23 – Equity\nfor further information.\nBunge Global SA, together with its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") in which it is considered the primary beneficiary, through which its businesses are conducted (collectively \"Bunge\" or \"the Company\"), is a leading global agribusiness and food company. Bunge operates in\nfour\nreportable segments: Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy.\nCorporate and Other, which is not a reportable segment, includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to the Company’s individual reporting segments because the operating performance of such reporting segments is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.\nAgribusiness\n—Bunge's Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business involved in the purchase, storage, transport, processing, and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. Bunge's agribusiness operations and assets are located in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific with merchandising and distribution offices throughout the world.\nBunge's Agribusiness segment also participates in related financial activities, such as offering trade structured finance, which leverages its international trade flows, providing risk management services to customers by assisting them with managing price exposure to agricultural commodities, foreign exchange, and other financial instruments.\nRefined and Specialty Oils\n—Bunge's Refined and Specialty Oils segment produces and sells edible oil products, such as packaged and bulk oils and fats, shortenings, margarines, mayonnaise, and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process, including renewable diesel feedstocks, and refines and fractionates palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and shea butter. Bunge's refined and specialty oils operations are located in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa.\nMilling\n—Bunge's Milling segment primarily comprises wheat and corn milling businesses that purchase wheat and corn directly from farmers and dealers and process them into milled products for food processors, bakeries, brewers, snack food producers, and other customers. Due to the completion of the sale of Bunge's Mexican wheat milling business during the third quarter of 2022, Bunge's wheat milling activities are now primarily located in Brazil. Corn milling activities are primarily located in the United States and Mexico. See\nNote 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions\nfor additional information on the completed sale of Bunge's Mexican wheat milling activities.\nSugar and Bioenergy\n—\nBunge's Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily consists of the Company's\n50\n% ownership interest in the net earnings of BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP p.l.c. (\"BP\"). The joint venture is a leading company in the ethanol, biopower, and sugar market in Brazil. BP Bunge Bioenergia operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of\n11\nmills located across the Southeast, North, and Midwest regions of Brazil. Bunge\naccounts for its interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting.\nArgentina\nBunge has significant operating subsidiaries in Argentina. Argentina has experienced hyperinflation, high fiscal deficit and negative Gross Domestic Product (\"GDP\") growth in recent quarters. Throughout 2023 and 2022, Argentina’s government has published multiple Emergency Decrees, certain of which have introduced preferential U.S. dollar to Argentine\npeso\nforeign exchange rates (collectively referred to as the \"Export Programs\"). Preferential exchange rates under the Export Programs are\nF-11\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\navailable exclusively during specific periods of time to be used on qualifying Argentine\npeso\ndenominated purchases of certain commodities and payment of export duties. The Export Programs were aimed at boosting farmer selling and in turn commodity exports generating an influx of foreign currency. During the periods covered by the Export Programs, qualifying commodity prices in Argentine\npesos\nwere directly impacted by the preferential rates. Transactions related to these Export Programs were accounted for at the preferential rate.\nUkraine-Russia War\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia initiated a military invasion of Ukraine (the \"war\"). Bunge’s Ukrainian operations comprise two oilseed crushing facilities, located in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk, a grain export terminal in Mykolaiv commercial seaport, numerous grain elevators, and an office in Kiev. The Company also operates a corn milling facility in Ukraine via a joint venture. As of December 31, 2023, total assets and total liabilities associated with Bunge’s Ukrainian subsidiaries each comprise less than 3% of Bunge’s consolidated Total assets and Total liabilities, respectively.\nBunge’s operational activities in Ukraine have steadily increased over the year, but remain limited and are subject to Bunge's ability to perform activities safely. On July 17, 2023, an agreement allowing the safe export of grain from three Ukrainian ports (Pivdennyi/Yuzhnvi, Odesa, and Chornomorsk; the \"POC corridor\") on the Black Sea expired. Following the termination of the POC corridor agreement, Russian attacks on key Ukrainian export infrastructure locations intensified. As of February 22, 2024, the termination of the POC corridor agreement and Russian attacks on key export infrastructure over the year have not significantly impacted Bunge's results of operations in Ukraine as alternative routes to export product are being effectively utilized. The scope, intensity, duration, and outcome of the ongoing war is uncertain, and any continuation or escalation of the war may have a material adverse effect on Bunge, including its Ukrainian operations.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized mark-to-market gains of $\n29\nmillion, respectively, in Cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income related to inventory recovered from its Mykolaiv and other facilities which had no carrying value as of December 31, 2022. No impairments or charges related to the war were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nBasis of Presentation\n—The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The accounting policies used to prepare these financial statements are the same as those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements in prior years, except as described in these notes or for the adoption of new standards as outlined below.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n—The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bunge, its subsidiaries and VIEs in which Bunge is considered to be the primary beneficiary and, as a result, include the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of all entities over which Bunge exercises control. Equity investments in which Bunge has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Investments in which Bunge does not exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, or fair value if readily determinable. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. An enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it has a controlling financial interest, defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the economics of the VIE and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE's operations. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. The primary beneficiary analysis must be continually reassessed and requires the exercise of judgement. VIE assessments are revisited upon the occurrence of relevant reconsideration events.\nNoncontrolling interests in subsidiaries related to Bunge's ownership interests of less than\n100\n% are reported as Noncontrolling interests or Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling ownership interests in Bunge's earnings, net of tax, is reported as Net (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income.\nReclassifications\n—Effective January 1, 2023, the Company changed its reporting of cash proceeds from and repayments of short-term debt with maturities of three months or less to be presented on a net basis in its consolidated statements of cash flows. Prior to January 1, 2023, the Company presented cash proceeds from and repayments of short-term debt with maturities of three months or less separately in its consolidated statements of cash flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current presentation.\nF-12\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nUse of Estimates\n—The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Bunge to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nOffsetting\n—In the normal course of its operations the Company routinely enters into transactions resulting in the recognition of assets and liabilities stemming from unconditional obligations, for example trade receivables and trade payables, or conditional obligations, for example unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts at fair value, with the same counterparty. The Company generally records all such assets and liabilities on a gross basis, even when they are subject to master netting agreements.\nHowever, the Company also engages in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of its global trade flows. These activities include programs under which Bunge generally obtains U.S. dollar and foreign currency denominated letters of credit (\"LCs\") from financial institutions, each based on an underlying commodity trade flow, and time deposits denominated in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts and other programs in which trade related payables are set-off against receivables, when all related assets and liabilities are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements and the criteria of ASC 210-20,\nOffsetting\n, has been met. Cash inflows are offset by the related cash outflows resulting from placement of the time deposits and repayment of the LCs. All cash flows related to the programs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTranslation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements\n—Bunge's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the majority of Bunge's foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. As such, amounts included in the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. However, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, if a foreign entity's economy is determined to be highly inflationary, then the foreign entity's financial statements are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency.\nForeign Currency Transactions\n—Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gain or loss is included in Bunge's consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net unless the remeasurement gain or loss relates to an intercompany transaction that is of a long-term investment nature and for which settlement is neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future, in which case the remeasurement gain or loss is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Cash held for sale\n—Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and readily marketable securities with original maturity dates of three months or less at the time of acquisition.\nRestricted cash is included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and cash and cash equivalents in Assets held for sale reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTrade Accounts Receivable\n—Trade accounts receivable is stated at historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Bunge establishes allowances for uncollectible trade accounts receivable based on lifetime expected credit losses using an aging schedule for each pool of trade accounts receivable. Pools are determined based on risk characteristics such as the type of customer and geography. A default rate is derived using a provision matrix with data based on Bunge's historical receivables information. The default rate is then applied to the pool to determine the allowance for expected credit losses. Given the short-term nature of the Company's trade accounts receivable, the default rate is only adjusted if significant changes in the credit profile of the portfolio are identified (e.g., poor crop years, credit issues at the country level, systematic risk), resulting in historic loss rates that are not representative of forecasted losses. Uncollectible accounts are\nF-13\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nwritten off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when the Company has determined that collection of the balance is unlikely.\nBunge records and reports accrued interest receivable within the same line item as the related trade accounts receivable. The allowance for expected credit losses is estimated on the amortized cost basis of the trade accounts receivable, including accrued interest receivable. Bunge recognizes credit loss expense when establishing an allowance for accrued interest receivable.\nSecured Advances to Suppliers\n—Secured advances to suppliers are stated at historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Secured advances to suppliers are expected to be settled through delivery of non-cash assets and as such, allowances are established when collection is not probable. Bunge establishes an allowance for secured advances to suppliers, generally farmers and resellers of grain, based on historical experience, farming economics and other market conditions, as well as specific supplier collection issues. Uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount below the outstanding historical balance or when Bunge has determined that collection is unlikely.\nSecured advances to suppliers bear interest at contractual rates that reflect current market interest rates at the time of the transaction. There are no deferred fees or costs associated with these receivables. As a result, there are no imputed interest amounts to be amortized under the interest method. Interest income is calculated based on the terms of the individual agreements and is recognized on an accrual basis.\nBunge follows accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses, which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes. Under this guidance, a class of receivables is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if Bunge determines it probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. Recognition of interest income is suspended once the borrower defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. No additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, at which time amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.\nInventories\n—Readily marketable inventories (\"RMI\") are agricultural commodity inventories, primarily including soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets, and international pricing mechanisms. All of Bunge's RMI are recorded at fair value. These agricultural commodity inventories have quoted prices in active markets, may be sold without significant further processing, and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. Changes in the fair values of RMI are recognized in earnings as a component of Cost of goods sold.\nInventories other than RMI are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value by inventory product class. Cost is determined primarily using the weighted-average cost method.\nFair Value Measurements\n—Bunge determines fair value based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Bunge determines the fair values of its RMI, derivatives, and certain other assets based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs based on market data obtained from sources independent of Bunge that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are inputs that are developed based on the best information available in circumstances that reflect Bunge's own assumptions based on market data and on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair value standard describes three levels within its hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value:\nF-14\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nBased on historical experience with Bunge’s suppliers and customers, Bunge’s own credit risk, and knowledge of current market conditions, Bunge does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.\nIn many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. Bunge’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.\nBunge’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.\nThe majority of Bunge's exchange-traded agricultural commodity futures are settled daily, generally through its clearing subsidiary, and therefore such futures are not included in the assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis\n.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n—Bunge enters into derivative instruments to manage its exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and energy costs. Bunge's use of these instruments is generally intended to mitigate exposure to market variables (see\nNote 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n). Additionally, commodity contracts relating to forward sales of commodities primarily in the Company’s Agribusiness segment, including but not limited to soybeans, soybean meal and oil, corn, and wheat, are accounted for as derivatives at fair value under ASC 815 (see\nRevenue Recognition\nbelow).\nGenerally, derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in Other current assets or Other current liabilities in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets. For derivatives designated as hedges, Bunge assesses at the inception of the hedge whether any such derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items and, on an ongoing basis, qualitatively monitors whether that assertion is still met. The changes in fair values of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, along with the gains or losses on the related hedged items are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income in the same caption as the hedged items. The changes in fair values of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings or when the hedge is no longer considered to be effective. In addition, Bunge may designate certain derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments as net investment hedges to hedge the exposure associated with its equity investments in foreign operations. When using forward derivative contracts as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.\nMarketable Securities and Other Short-Term Investments\n—Bunge classifies its marketable debt securities and short-term investments as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, or held-for-trading. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Held-to-maturity debt investments represent financial assets in which Bunge has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. Debt\nF-15\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ntrading securities and all equity securities are recorded at fair value and are bought and held principally for selling them in the near term and therefore held for only a short period of time, with all gains (losses) included in Net income. Bunge monitors its held-to-maturity investments for impairment periodically and recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of an investment is judged to be other than temporary.\nRecoverable Taxes\n—Recoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of raw materials and taxable services and other transactional taxes, which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes or other taxes owed by Bunge, primarily in Brazil and Europe. These recoverable tax payments are included in Other current assets or Other non-current assets based on their expected realization. In cases where Bunge determines that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n—Property, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements that extend either the life, capacity, efficiency, or improve the safety of an asset are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Costs related to legal obligations associated with the future retirement of capitalized assets are capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset. Bunge capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred during the application development stage. Interest costs on borrowings during construction/completion periods of major capital projects are also capitalized.\nDepreciation is computed based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nEstimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment are as follows:\nGoodwill\n—Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment, or between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Bunge's annual impairment testing is generally performed during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which has been determined to be the Company's operating segments or one level below the operating segments in certain instances (see\nNote 8- Goodwill\n).\nOther Intangible Assets\n—Finite-lived intangible assets primarily include trademarks, customer relationships and lists, port facility usage rights, licenses and patents that are amortized on a straight-line basis over their contractual or legal lives, or their estimated useful lives where such lives are not determined by law or contract (see\nNote 9- Other Intangible Assets\n).\nImpairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets\n—Bunge reviews its property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Bunge bases its evaluation of recoverability on such indicators as the nature, future economic benefits, and geographic locations of the assets, historical or future profitability measures, and other external market conditions. If these indicators result in the expected non-recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, Bunge evaluates potential impairment using undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If such undiscounted future cash flows during the asset's remaining useful life are below the asset's carrying value, a loss is recognized for the shortfall, measured by the present value of the estimated future cash flows or by third-party appraisals. Bunge records impairments related to property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets used in the processing of its products in Cost of goods sold in its consolidated statements of income. Any impairment of marketing or brand assets is recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") in the consolidated statements of income (see\nNote 10- Impairments\n).\nProperty, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nInvestments in Affiliates\n—Bunge has investments in various unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, minus impairment. Bunge reviews its investments annually or when an event or circumstances indicate that a potential decline in value may be other than temporary. Bunge considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time the fair value of the investment is expected to be below its carrying value, the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of the affiliate, and Bunge's intent and ability to hold the\nF-16\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ninvestment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the fair value (see\nNote 10- Impairments\nand\nNote 11- Investments in Affiliates and Variable Interest Entities\n).\nRevenue Recognition\n—The Company’s revenue comprises sales from commodity contracts that are accounted for under ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n(\"ASC 815\"),\nand sales of other products and services that are accounted for under ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n(\"ASC 606\"). Additional information about the Company’s revenues can be found in\nNote 27- Segment Information\n.\nRevenue from commodity contracts (ASC 815)\n—Revenue from commodity contracts primarily relates to forward sales of commodities including, but not limited to soybeans, soybean meal and oil, corn, and wheat accounted for as derivatives at fair value under ASC 815, primarily in the Company’s Agribusiness segment. These forward sales meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 as they have an underlying (e.g., the price of soybeans), a notional amount (e.g., metric tons), no initial net investment, and can be net settled since the commodity is readily convertible to cash. Bunge generally does not apply the normal purchase and normal sale exception available under ASC 815 to these contracts. Certain of the Company’s sales in its Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments also qualify as derivatives, primarily sales of commodities like bulk soybean and canola oil.\nRevenue from commodity contracts is recognized in Net sales for the contracted amount when the contracts are settled at a point in time by transferring control of the commodity to the customer, similarly to revenue recognized from contracts with customers under ASC 606. From inception through settlement, these forward sales arrangements are recorded at fair value under ASC 815 with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Cost of goods sold and carried on the consolidated balance sheets as current assets (see\nNote 6- Other Current Assets\n) or current liabilities (see\nNote 13- Other Current Liabilities\n), respectively. Further information about the fair value of these contracts is presented in\nNote 15- Fair Value Measurements\n.\nRevenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606)\n—Revenue from contracts with customers accounted for under ASC 606 is primarily generated in the Company's Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments through the sale of refined edible oil-based products such as packaged vegetable oils, shortenings, margarines, and mayonnaise; milled grain products such as wheat flours, bakery mixes, and corn-based products; and fertilizer products. These sales are accounted for under ASC 606 as these sales arrangements do not meet the criteria to be considered derivatives under ASC 815. These revenues are measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and exclude sales taxes, discounts related to promotional programs, and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue from these contracts at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer, generally when legal title and risks and rewards transfer to the customer. Sales terms provide for transfer of title either at the time and point of shipment or at the time and point of delivery and acceptance of the product being sold. In contracts that do not specify the timing of transfer of legal title or transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership, judgment is required in determining the timing of transfer of control. In such cases, the Company considers standard business practices and the relevant laws and regulations applicable to the transaction to determine when legal title or the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.\nThe transaction price is generally allocated to performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on observable data of the Company’s sales of such products and services to similar customers and in similar circumstances on a standalone basis. In assessing whether to allocate variable consideration to a specific part of the contract, the Company considers the nature of the variable payment and whether it relates specifically to its efforts to satisfy a specific part of the contract. Variable consideration is generally known upon satisfaction of the performance obligation.\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction, which are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nShipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of goods sold.\nWarranties provided to customers are primarily assurance-type warranties on the fitness of purpose and merchantability of the Company’s goods and services. The Company does not provide service-type warranties to customers.\nPayment is generally due at the time of shipment or delivery, or within a specified time frame after shipment or delivery, which is generally 30-60 days. The Company’s contracts generally provide customers the right to reject any products that do not meet agreed quality specifications. Product returns and refunds are not material.\nF-17\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAdditionally, the Company recognizes revenue in the Agribusiness segment from ocean freight and port services over time, as the related services are performed. Performance obligations are typically completed within a fiscal quarter and any unearned revenue or accrued revenues are not material.\nShare-Based Compensation\n—Bunge maintains equity incentive plans for its employees and non-employee directors (see\nNote 25- Share-based Compensation\n). Bunge accounts for share-based compensation based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nIncome Taxes\n—Income tax expenses and benefits are recognized based on the tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Bunge's subsidiaries operate. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in Bunge's consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if current evidence indicates that it is not \"more likely than not\" that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in Income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income (see\nNote 14- Income Taxes\n).\nResearch and Development\n—Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nResearch and development expenses\nwere\n$\n35\nmillion\n, $\n33\nmillion,\nand $\n33\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGovernmental Assistance\n—Government grants are accounted for by analogy to International Accounting Standard 20,\nAccounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance\n, and are recognized at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the established conditions will be met and the benefit will be received. Benefits are recognized either as a reduction of taxes payable or a credit in earnings.\nBunge qualifies for business incentives from governmental entities at various localities in which the Company operates. These programs primarily consist of tax incentives and cash grants designed to promote regional social and economic development or to incentivize production of clean energy.\nRegional social and economic development\n—Bunge receives tax credits from foreign state governments on the sale of eligible products. The program is valid through 2032 and contains recapture features if Bunge fails to meet program requirements, including job creation and production levels. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Bunge recorded program tax credits of $\n176\nmillion and $\n205\nmillion in Net sales in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Bunge recognized a $\n13\nmillion and $\n17\nmillion reduction to Other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets related to benefits not yet realized, respectively.\nClean energy\n—Bunge receives cash grants from a governmental agency from the sale of clean energy. The program is valid through 2032 and contains recapture features if the Company does not follow program production efficiency requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Bunge recorded program related cash grants of $\n24\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion in\nCost of goods sold\nin the consolidated statements of income, respectively. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Bunge recognized $\n1\nmillion in Trade accounts receivable and a $\n10\nmillion reduction to Trade accounts payable, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets related to benefits not yet realized.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2020-04,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848),\nto provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting designed to ease the financial reporting burden related to reference rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB subsequently issued ASU 2022-06,\nDeferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848\n, to ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of time during which a significant number of modifications to eligible contracts and hedging relationships may take place. The ASU defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. As of December 31, 2023, Bunge has concluded the modification of all eligible contracts and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements.\nF-18\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740)\n. The standard requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. The new requirements apply to all entities subject to income taxes and will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting—Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280)\n. The standard requires incremental disclosures related to reportable segments, including disaggregated expense information and the title and position of the company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), as identified for purposes of segment determination. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Entities must adopt the changes to the segment reporting guidance on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n2.\nACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\nAcquisitions\nViterra Limited Business Combination Agreement\nOn June 13, 2023, Bunge Limited entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the \"Business Combination Agreement\") with Viterra Limited (\"Viterra\") and its shareholders including certain affiliates of Glencore PLC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (collectively, the \"Sellers\"), to acquire Viterra in a stock and cash transaction (the \"Acquisition\"). Bunge shareholders approved the Acquisition at the Extraordinary General Meeting held October 5, 2023. The Acquisition of Viterra by Bunge will create an innovative global agribusiness company well positioned to meet the demands of increasingly complex markets and better serve farmers and end-customers.\nUnder the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Viterra shareholders are anticipated to receive approximately\n65.6\nmillion registered shares of Bunge, with an aggregate value of approximately $\n6.6\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and receive approximately $\n2.0\nbillion in cash (collectively the \"Transaction Consideration\"), in return for 100% of the outstanding equity of Viterra. The determination of the final value of the Transaction Consideration will depend on the Company's share price at the time of closing. Upon completion of the transaction, the Sellers are expected to own approximately\n30\n% of the combined Bunge company on a fully diluted basis, before giving effect to any share repurchases by Bunge occurring after June 13, 2023.\nIn connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Bunge has secured a total of $\n8.0\nbillion in acquisition debt financing (\"Acquisition Financing\"). Bunge intends to use a portion of the Acquisition Financing to fund the cash portion of the Transaction Consideration, and the remainder for repayment of certain indebtedness of Viterra, which is expected to be repaid at closing and for the ongoing operations of the combined company following closing. See\nNote 18- Long-term Debt\nfor further information.\nThe Acquisition is anticipated to close as early as mid-2024, subject to the satisfaction of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The Business Combination Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties and includes certain customary termination rights. If the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in connection with certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain certain antitrust and competition clearances that are conditions to closing, Bunge would be obligated to pay the Sellers a fee of $\n400\nmillion in the aggregate.\nF-19\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAdditionally, on June 12, 2023, in contemplation of the Business Combination Agreement, Bunge Limited's Board of Directors approved a $\n1.7\nbillion expansion of the existing share repurchase program for the repurchase of Bunge's issued and outstanding shares. Approximately $\n300\nmillion remained outstanding under the existing program prior to the expansion of the program, resulting in an aggregate remaining program size of up to $\n2.0\nbillion of repurchases of Bunge's issued and outstanding shares. Under this program, Bunge repurchased\n5,407,861\nshares for $\n600\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2023. Therefore, as of December 31, 2023, $\n1.4\nbillion remains outstanding for repurchases under the program. See\nNote 23- Equity\nfor further details on share repurchases.\nEspaçogrãos Grain Elevators\nOn November 30, 2023, Bunge entered into purchase and sale agreements with Espaçogrãos to acquire three grain elevators and related assets (\"Silos\") for total cash consideration of approximately $\n85\nmillion, inclusive of $\n35\nmillion of advance payments expected prior to the close. Advance payments are refundable under certain conditions, including in the event closing does not occur. The Silos are located in the Brazilian cities of Nova Mutum, Matupa and Alta Floresta. The asset acquisitions are expected to close separately per each agreement in 2024 and 2025, subject to certain closing conditions.\nCJ Latam and Selecta Share Purchase Agreement\nOn October 10, 2023, Bunge entered into a definitive share purchase agreement with CJ CheilJedang Corporation and STIC CJ Global Investment Corporate Partnership Private Equity Fund to acquire\n100\n% of outstanding equity of CJ Latam Participações Ltda. and CJ Selecta S.A. (collectively, \"CJ\") for a total cash consideration of approximately $\n510\nmillion to be adjusted for net debt, plus an additional sum in consideration for the value of net working capital. Operations of CJ primarily consist of an oilseed processing facility located in Brazil. Bunge expects to finance the transaction through cash from operations and existing financing facilities. The acquisition is expected to close in mid-2024, subject to customary closing conditions.\nFuji Oils New Orleans, LLC Port Based Refinery\nOn April 14, 2023, Bunge, through its\n80\n% ownership of Bunge Loders Croklaan joint venture with IOI Corporation Berhad, completed its purchase of Fuji Oils New Orleans, LLC's port based refinery. The refinery is located in International-Matex Tank Terminals' Avondale Terminal, in Avondale, Louisiana in the United States. Cash consideration for the asset acquisition of $\n181\nmillion was allocated to Property, plant and equipment, net ($\n220\nmillion), inclusive of a finance lease right of use asset ($\n52\nmillion), long-term finance lease obligations ($\n41\nmillion) included in Long-term debt and Current portion of long-term debt, and other net working capital ($\n2\nmillion).\nDispositions\nRussian Oilseed Processing and Refining Operations Disposition\nOn September 16, 2022, Bunge signed an agreement to sell its remaining Russian operations, primarily comprising an oilseed crushing and refining facility in Voronezh, southwest Russia (referred to as the \"disposal group\"), to Karen Vanetsyan (the \"Buyer\"), in exchange for a cash price approximately equal to the book value of the disposal group's net assets. On January 9, 2023, Bunge and the Buyer agreed to a purchase price adjustment. The purchase price adjustment and cumulative translation adjustment losses, among other items related to the disposal group, resulted in a corresponding impairment loss on sale of $\n103\nmillion, recognized in Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2022. On February 3, 2023, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the agreement with no material impact to the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nF-20\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIn connection with the transaction, Bunge agreed to indemnify the Buyer against certain legal claims involving Bunge's Russian subsidiary. Management has assessed the likelihood of any loss related to claims covered by the indemnity as remote, and recognized a liability in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 460,\nGuarantees\n. See\nNote 21- Commitments and Contingencies\nfor more information.\nThe following table presents the book values of the major classes of assets and liabilities that were included in the disposal group at the closing date. Intercompany balances between the disposal group and other Bunge consolidated entities have been omitted. Assets included in the disposal group comprised $\n12\nmillion and $\n21\nmillion, reported under the Agribusiness segment and Refined and Specialty Oils segment, respectively. Liabilities included in the disposal group comprised $\n6\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion, reported under the Agribusiness segment and Refined and Specialty Oils segment, respectively.\nMexico Wheat Milling Disposition\nOn October 12, 2021, Bunge entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of its wheat milling business in Mexico in exchange for cash proceeds approximately equal to the book value of property, plant and equipment, net, plus an additional sum in consideration for the value of net working capital to be transferred upon closing. Additionally, cumulative translation adjustments, among other items related to the disposal group, resulted in a corresponding impairment loss on sale of $\n170\nmillion, recognized in Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company also incurred a $\n30\nmillion tax expense in connection with the disposal. On September 14, 2022, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\nF-21\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table presents the book values of the major classes of assets and liabilities that were included in the disposal group, reported under the Milling segment:\nUS Grain Disposition\nOn April 21, 2020, Bunge announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell a portfolio of interior grain elevators located in the United States. On July 9, 2021, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Upon closing, Bunge received cash proceeds of $\n298\nmillion in consideration for the book value of property, plant and equipment, net, plus an additional sum in consideration for the value of net working capital transferred on the date of closing, resulting in a gain on sale of $\n158\nmillion recognized in Other (expense) income—net, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe following table presents the book values of the major classes of assets and liabilities that were included in the disposal group, reported under the Agribusiness segment:\nRotterdam Oils Refinery Disposition\nOn November 4, 2020, Bunge announced that its Bunge Loders Croklaan joint venture had entered into an agreement to sell its oil refinery located in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Bunge is leasing back the facility from the buyer in a phased transition through 2024 so that it can continue to supply its customers with its products. The transaction, accounted for as an asset sale, closed during the first quarter of 2021. The Company recorded a gain of $\n219\nmillion on the sale, including the noncontrolling\nF-22\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ninterest portion, which was recorded within\nOther (expense) income—net\n, in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe following table presents the book values of the major classes of assets and liabilities that were included in the disposal group, reported under the Refined and Specialty Oils segment:\nMexico Oils Facility Disposition\nDuring 2021, Bunge completed the sale of its oils packaging facility in Queretaro, Mexico. The transaction primarily includes the location's property, plant and equipment and related processes. The Company recorded a gain of $\n19\nmillion on the sale, which was recorded within Other (expense) income—net in the consolidated statement of income.\nThe following table presents the book values of the major classes of assets included in the disposal group, reported under the Refined and Specialty Oils segment:\n3.\nTRADE STRUCTURED FINANCE PROGRAM\nThe Company engages in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of its global trade flows. These activities include programs under which Bunge generally obtains U.S. dollar and foreign currency denominated letters of credit (\"LCs\") from financial institutions, each based on an underlying commodity trade flow, and time deposits denominated in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts, in which trade related payables are set-off against receivables, all of which are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, net returns from these activities were $\n36\nmillion, $\n32\nmillion, and $\n31\nmillion, respectively, and were included as a reduction of Cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, time deposits and LCs of $\n6,880\nmillion and $\n5,901\nmillion, respectively, were presented net on the consolidated balance sheets as the criteria of ASC 210-20,\nOffsetting\n, had been met. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, time deposits, including those presented on a net basis, carried weighted-average interest rates of\n5.77\n% and\n3.46\n%, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, total net proceeds from issuances of LCs were $\n6,730\nmillion, $\n5,826\nmillion and $\n6,522\nmillion, respectively. These cash inflows are offset by the related cash outflows resulting from placement of the time deposits and repayment of the LCs. All cash flows related to the programs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAs part of the trade structured finance activities, LCs may be sold to financial institutions on a discounted basis. Bunge does not service derecognized LCs. The terms of the sale may require the Company to continue to make periodic interest payments to financial institutions based on changes in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") for a period of up to\nF-23\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\none year\n. Bunge’s payment obligation to financial institutions as part of the trade structured finance activities, reported in Other current liabilities, including any unrealized gain or loss on changes in SOFR is not significant as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The notional amounts of LCs subject to continuing variable interest payments that have been derecognized from the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in\nNote 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n. The net gain or loss included in Cost of goods sold resulting from the fair valuation of such variable interest rate obligations is not significant for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n4.\nTRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND TRADE RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION PROGRAM\nTrade Accounts Receivable\nChanges to the allowance for expected credit losses related to Trade accounts receivable are as follows:\n(1)\nLong-term portion of the allowance for credit losses is included in Other non-current assets.\n(1)\nLong-term portion of the allowance for credit losses is included in Other non-current assets.\n(2)\nTransfers represent an increase in the allowance on owned receivables resulting from the repurchase of receivables previously included in the trade receivables securitization program as a result of the November 16, 2022 amendment described below.\nTrade Receivables Securitization Program\nBunge and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a trade receivables securitization program (the \"Program\") with a financial institution, as administrative agent, and certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the \"Purchasers\"). Koninklijke Bunge B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bunge, acts as master servicer, responsible for servicing and collecting the accounts receivable for the Program. The Program is designed to enhance Bunge’s financial flexibility by providing an additional source of liquidity for its operations.\nF-24\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOn December 18, 2023, Bunge and certain of its subsidiaries amended the Program which\nincreased its aggregate size by $\n400\nmillion to an aggregate of $\n1.5\nbillion and increased the size of the accordion feature by $\n750\nmillion to $\n1\nbillion. The Program will terminate on May 17, 2031; however, each committed purchaser's commitment to purchase trade receivables under the Program will terminate earlier on December 17, 2024, with a feature that permits Bunge to request 364-day extensions. In addition, the December 18, 2023 amendment revised the premiums or discounts to such applicable margin tied to certain sustainability criteria, including, but not limited to, science-based targets (\"SBTs\") that define Bunge’s climate goals within its operations and a commitment to a deforestation-free supply chain in 2025.\nAs the result of a June 21, 2023 Program amendment, Bunge Limited’s obligations as existing guarantor were automatically assigned to Bunge Global SA as successor guarantor, effective on November 1, 2023 following the completion of the Redomestication (see\nNote 1 - Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies\n).\nThe Program’s current pledge structure results from a November 16, 2022 amendment which replaced the existing deferred purchase price (\"DPP\") structure. Under the new structure, Bunge Securitization B.V. (\"BSBV\"), a consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, transfers certain trade receivables to the Purchasers in exchange for a cash payment up to the aggregate size of the Program. Bunge also retains ownership of a population of unsold receivables. BSBV agrees to guaranty the collection of sold receivables and grants a lien to the administrative agent on all unsold receivables. Collections on unsold receivables and guarantee payments are classified as operating activities in Bunge’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAt November 16, 2022, the effective date of the amended Program, $\n741\nmillion of sold receivables were repurchased through a non-cash investing exchange of the DPP. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had collected a total of $\n733\nmillion of repurchased receivables, including $\n87\nmillion collected in the year ended December 31, 2023, which are reported as Proceeds from beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables under investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nBunge's risk of loss following the sale of trade receivables is limited to the assets of BSBV, primarily comprised of unsold receivables pledged to the administrative agent.\nThe table below summarizes the cash flows and discounts of Bunge's trade receivables associated with the Program. Servicing fees under the Program were not significant in any period.\n(1)\nPrior to November 16, 2022, the Company recognized these proceeds net of the DPP, consisting of a receivable from the Purchasers that entitled the Company to certain collections on the receivable. The Company recognized the collection of the DPP in net cash provided by investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result of the November 16, 2022 amendment, Bunge will report collections on newly originated, unsold receivables held by BSBV as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nNon-cash activity for the Program in the reporting period is represented by the difference between gross receivables sold and cash collections from customers on receivables previously sold\n.\nF-25\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n5.\nINVENTORIES\nInventory by segment consists of the following:\nRMI by segment consists of the following:\n(1)\nAssets held for sale includes RMI of\nzero\nand\n$\n26\nmillion\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company engages in trading and distribution, or merchandising activities. Included in\nRMI is $\n4,242\nmillion and $\n4,789\nmillion attributable to merchandising activities at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n6.\nOTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nOther current assets consist of the following:\n(1)\nPrepaid commodity purchase contracts represent advance payments against contracts for future delivery of specified quantities of agricultural commodities. The balance includes certain advance payments on contracts with various unconsolidated investees see\nNote 20- Related Party Transactions\n.\n(2)\nBunge provides cash advances to suppliers, primarily Brazilian soybean farmers, to finance a portion of the suppliers' production costs, primarily to secure the origination of soybeans for Bunge's soybean processing facilities in Brazil.\nF-26\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe balance includes certain advance payments on contracts with various unconsolidated investees see\nNote 20- Related Party Transactions\n. Bunge does not bear any of the costs or operational risks associated with growing the related crops. The ability of Bunge's counterparties to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography, which are in turn affected by commodity prices, currency exchange rates, crop input costs, and crop quality and yields. As a result, the advan\nces are largely collateralized by future crops and physical assets of the suppliers, carry a local market interest rate, an\nd settle when the farmers' crops are harvested and sold.\nThe secured advances to suppliers are reported net of allowances of $\n8\nmillion a\nnd $\n7\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Bunge periodically evaluates the collectability of Bunge’s suppliers receivables and records allowances if Bunge determines that collection is doubtful. Bunge bases the Company’s determination of the allowance on analyses of the credit quality of individual accounts, also considering the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions, as well as the value of any collateral related to amounts owed. Bunge continuously reviews defaulted supplier receivables for impairment on an individual account basis. Bunge considers all accounts in legal collection processes to be defaulted and past due. For such accounts, Bunge determines the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral, net of estimated costs to sell. For all renegotiated accounts (current and past due), Bunge considers changes in farm economic conditions and other market conditions, Bunge’s historical experience related to renegotiated accounts, and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nInterest earned on secured advances to suppliers\nof $\n25\nmillion\n, $\n22\nmillion,\nand $\n26\nmillion, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, is included in Net sales in the consolidated statements of income.\n(3)\nMarketable securities and other short-term investments—Bunge invests in foreign government securities, corporate debt securities, deposits, equity securities, and other securities.\nThe following is a summary of amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as marketable securities and other short-term investments.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $\n67\nmillion and $\n89\nmillion, respectively, of marketable securities and other short-term investments are recorded at fair value. All other investments are recorded at cost, and due to the short-term nature of these investments, their carrying values approximate fair values. For the years ended December 31, 2023,  2022, and 2021, unrealized gains/(losses) of\nzero\n, $(\n140\n) million, and $\n47\nmillion, respectively, have been recorded and recognized in Other income (expense) - net for investments held at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nF-27\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n7.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty, plant and equipment, net consist of the following:\nBunge's paid and accrued capital expenditures amounted to $\n1,192\nmillion, $\n593\nmillion, and $\n437\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Included in these capitalized expenditures was capitalized interest on construction in progress of $\n19\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion, and $\n2\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Depreciation and depletion expense was $\n390\nmillion, $\n363\nmillion, and $\n376\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n8.\nGOODWILL\nBunge generally performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter. If events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses, the Company performs an impairment analysis at that date. These events or circumstances could inc\nlude a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or the sale or disposition of a significant asset. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, the Company: (1) validates changes, if any, to its reporting units with goodwill balances; (2) allocates goodwill to its reporting units to which acquired goodwill relates; (3) determines the carrying value, or\nbook value, of its reporting units; (4) estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model and/or using market multiples; (5) compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value; and (6) if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for such amount, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nCritical estimates in the determination of fair value under both the income and market approach include, but are not limited to, assumptions about variables such as commodity prices, crop and related throughput and production volumes, profitability, future capital expenditures, other expenses, and discount rates, all of which are subject to a high degree of judgment.\nF-28\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nChanges in the carrying value of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n(1)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to sell its operations in Russia.

The discontinuation triggered a reassessment of the trademarks' estimated useful lives resulting in accelerated amortization through December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, accelerated amortization expense of $\n21\nmillion was recorded to SG&A expenses within the Refined and Specialty Oils segment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Net income attributable to Bunge included $\n12\nmillion of expense (net of $\n5\nmillion in tax expense) and Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests included $\n3\nmillion of expense (net of $\n1\nmillion in tax expense) related to accelerated amortization.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to sell its remaining Russian operations.

As a result of the impairments, there is no carrying value associated with the equity method investments in Merit and APP at December 31, 2023.\nF-32\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nOn September 19, 2023, Bunge entered into a fixed-priced call option agreement (\"Option\") to acquire the shares of Terminal de Granéis de Santa Catarina (\"TGSC\") with primary assets consisting of a grain port terminal currently under construction in South America strategically located near an existing Bunge facility. The agreement requires Bunge to make future installment payments for the Option which will be utilized, in part, to fund terminal construction. Required installment payments prior to the exercise of the Option are not material and are expected to be applied against the exercise price of the Option. TGSC is a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") as a result of having insufficient equity at risk. Bunge is the primary beneficiary due to a de facto agent relationship with the equity owner of TGSC and has consolidated the entity. As all of TGSC’s equity is held by a third-party, Bunge reflects all TGSC earnings and equity as attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets, respectively.\nTGSC is not a business as defined by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, the non-cash transaction resulting in initial consolidation of TGSC in the third quarter of 2023 represents an asset acquisition. Positions recognized in the consolidated balance sheet upon initial consolidation consisted primarily of Other intangible assets, net - license ($\n87\nmillion); Property, plant and equipment, net - construction-in-process ($\n36\nmillion); Long-term debt ($\n35\nmillion); and Noncontrolling interests ($\n91\nmillion). Bunge did not recognize any gain or loss upon initial consolidation of TGSC. TGSC's assets can only be used to settle the entity’s own obligations and TGSC’s creditors have no recourse to Bunge’s assets beyond Bunge’s maximum exposure to loss associated with TGSC at any given time.\nOn May 1, 2022, Bunge completed a transaction with Chevron to create a joint venture, Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC (the \"Joint Venture\"), leveraging Bunge’s expertise in oilseed processing and farmer relationships, and Chevron’s expertise in fuels manufacturing and marketing, to help meet the demand for renewable fuels and to develop lower carbon intensity feedstocks.\nThe Joint Venture is a VIE in which Bunge is considered to be the primary beneficiary because it is responsible for the day-to-day operating decisions of the Joint Venture as well as the marketing of the principal products, primarily soybean meal and oil produced and sold by the Joint Venture, among other factors. The Joint Venture's assets can only be used to settle the Joint Venture’s own obligations and the Joint Venture’s creditors have no recourse to Bunge’s assets beyond Bunge’s maximum exposure to loss associated with the Joint Venture at any given time.\nThe following table presents the values of the assets and liabilities associated with the above listed VIEs in which Bunge is considered the primary beneficiary to the extent included in Bunge’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022\n. All amounts exclude intercompany balances, which have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nFor all other VIEs in which Bunge is considered the primary beneficiary, the entities meet the definition of a business, and the VIE's assets can be used other than for the settlement of the VIE’s obligations.\nAs such these VIEs have been excluded from the below table.\nF-33\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNon-Consolidated Variable Interest Entities\nBunge holds investment interests in various entities, as described above, that are included in Investments in affiliates and Other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain of these investments, which are primarily reported in Bunge's Agribusiness segment and Corporate and Other, have been determined to be variable interest entities for which Bunge has determined it is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, these investments are not consolidated by Bunge. Bunge's exposure to loss related to these unconsolidated investments is $\n589\nmillion and $\n472\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Bunge's exposure to loss primarily comprises Bunge's investments balance, third party guarantees, prepayments, and long term loans, assuming full loss of the investment balance and full payment of the guarantees regardless of the probability of such losses actually being incurred in accordance with US GAAP disclosure rules. See\nNote 21- Commitments and Contingencies\n.\nF-34\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n12.\nOTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS\nOther non-current assets consist of the following:\n(1)\nA significant portion of these non-current assets arise primarily from Bunge's Brazilian operations and their realization could take several years.\n(2)\nNet of allowances as described in\nNote 4- Trade Accounts Receivable and Trade Receivable Securitization Program\n.\n(3)\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $\n12\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion, respectively, of long-term investments were recorded at fair value.\nRecoverable taxes, net\n—Recoverable taxes are reported net of allowances of $\n13\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nJudicial deposits\n—Judicial deposits are funds that Bunge has placed on deposit with the courts in Brazil. These Brazilian funds are held in judicial escrow related to certain legal proceedings pending resolution and bear interest at the\nSelic\nrate, which is the benchmark rate of the Brazilian central bank.\nIncome taxes receivable\n—Income taxes receivable include overpayments of current income taxes plus accrued interest. These income tax prepayments are expected to be used to settle future income tax obligations. Income taxes receivable in Brazil bear interest at the\nSelic\nrate.\nLong-term investments\n—Long-term investments primarily comprise Bunge's noncontrolling equity investments in growth stage agribusiness and food companies held by Bunge Ventures.\nAffiliate loans receivable\n—Affiliate loans receivable are primarily interest-bearing receivables from unconsolidated affiliates with remaining maturities of more than\none year\n.\nLong-term receivables from farmers in Brazil, net\n—Bunge provides financing to farmers in Brazil, primarily through secured advances against farmer commitments to deliver agricultural commodities (primarily soybeans) upon harvest of the then-current year's crop, and through credit sales of fertilizer to farmers. The balance includes certain advance payments on contracts with various unconsolidated investees see\nNote 20- Related Party Transactions\n. Certain such long-term receivables from farmers are originally recorded in Other current assets as prepaid commodity purchase contracts or secured advances to suppliers (see\nNote 6- Other Current Assets\n) or Other non-current assets according to their maturity. Advances initially recorded in Other current assets are reclassified to Other non-current assets if collection issues arise and amounts become past due with resolution of such matters expected to take more than one year.\nThe average recorded investment in long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n88\nmillion and $\n90\nmillion, respectively.\nThe table below summarizes Bunge's recorded investment in long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil and the related allowance amounts.\nF-35\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(1)\nAll amounts in legal process are considered past due upon initiation of legal action.\n(2)\nThese renegotiated amounts are current on repayment terms.\n(3)\nNew advances expected to be realized through farmer commitments to deliver agricultural commodities in crop periods greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date. Such advances are reclassified from Other non-current assets to Other current assets in later periods depending on the expected date of their realization.\nThe table below summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil.\n13.\nOTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\nOther current liabilities consist of the following:\n(1)\nThe Company records advances on sales when cash payments are received in advance of the Company's performance and recognizes revenue once the related performance obligation is completed. Advances on sales are impacted by the seasonality of Bunge's business, including the timing of harvests in the northern and southern hemispheres, and amounts at each balance sheet date will generally be recognized in earnings within twelve months or less.\nF-36\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n14.\nINCOME TAXES\nBunge operates globally and is subject to the tax laws and regulations of numerous tax jurisdictions and authorities as well as tax agreements and treaties among these jurisdictions. Bunge's income tax provision is impacted by, among other factors, changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange rates and Bunge's profitability in each tax jurisdiction.\nBunge has elected to use the U.S. federal income tax rate to reconcile the actual provision for income taxes.\nThe components of Income before income tax are as follows:\nThe components of the Income tax expense are as follows:\nF-37\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nReconciliation of Income tax expense if computed at the U.S. federal income tax rate to Bunge's reported Income tax expense is as follows:\n(1)\nFiscal incentives predominantly relate to investment incentives in Brazil that are exempt from Brazilian income tax.\n(2)\nDuring 2023, Bunge was granted tax credits in Switzerland that expire through 2032, and recorded a net benefit for the amount that Bunge believes is more likely than not to be realized prior to expiration.\nF-38\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe primary components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related valuation allowances are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023, Bunge has determined it has unremitted earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested of approximately $\n1.7\nbillion, and accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made. If these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, Bunge would be subject to income taxes in the form of withholding taxes to the recipient for an amount of approximately $\n100\nmillion.\nAt December 31, 2023, Bunge's pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $\n2.3\nbillion, of which $\n2.1\nbillion have no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $\n1.3\nbillion in Brazil. While loss carryforwards in Brazil can be carried forward indefinitely, annual utilization is limited to\n30\n% of taxable income calculated on an entity by entity basis as Brazil tax law does not allow consolidated tax filings. At December 31, 2022, Bunge's pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $\n2.4\nbillion, of which $\n2.3\nbillion have no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $\n1.3\nbillion in Brazil. The decrease in pre-tax loss carryforwards from 2022 to 2023 is primarily attributable to the Company’s utilization of losses in certain jurisdictions during the year. The remaining tax loss carryforwards expire at various periods beginning in 2024 through the year 2043.\nAt December 31, 2023, Bunge’s tax credit carryforwards totaled $\n454\nmillion, of which $\n440\nmillion expire between 2029 and 2032, $\n10\nmillion expire between 2024 and 2026, and $\n4\nmillion have no expiration. At December 31, 2022, Bunge’s tax credit carryforwards totaled $\n22\nmillion.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances\n—Bunge records valuation allowances when current evidence does not suggest that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on Bunge's ability to generate sufficient timely future income of the appropriate character in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Bunge has recorded valuation allowances of $\n590\nmillion and $\n269\nmillion, respectively. The net increase of $\n321\nmillion is primarily attributable to valuation allowance established on tax credits generated during the year where Bunge believes a portion of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\n—ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes\n(\"ASC 740\")  requires applying a \"more likely than not\" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. Accordingly, Bunge recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, Bunge\nF-39\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nhad recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $\n68\nmillion and $\n59\nmillion in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, Bunge recognized less than $\n1\nmillion, $(\n7\n) million and $\n4\nmillion of interest and penalty charges in Income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, Bunge had recorded accrued interest and penalties of $\n10\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits follows:\n(1)\nReduction of tax position in Spain resulting from the conclusion of an appeals process. This decrease had no impact on the consolidated statement of income or the consolidated balance sheet as the position was not previously recognized under ASC 740.\nBunge believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $\n8\nmillion of its unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2024 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations.\nBunge, through its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the United States (federal and various states) and non-United States regions.\nThe table below reflects the tax years for which Bunge is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities in significant tax regions:\nAs of December 31, 2023, Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries have received income tax and penalty assessments through 2018 of approximately R$\n5.3\nbillion (approximately $\n1.1\nbillion) plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount. Bunge has recorded unrecognized tax benefits related to these assessments of R$\n12\nmillion (approximately $\n3\nmillion) as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement, in consultation with external legal advisors, believes that it is more likely than not that Bunge will prevail on the proposed assessments (with the exception of unrecognized tax benefits discussed above) in Brazil and is vigorously defending its position against these assessments.\nBunge made cash income tax payments, net of refunds received, of $\n655\nmillion, $\n570\nmillion and $\n531\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nDuring 2023, various countries enacted into law the global minimum tax provisions similar to the Pillar 2 Model Rules as previously approved by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the \"OECD\") / G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\"BEPS\"). The global minimum tax rules provide for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. Most notably for Bunge, the Netherlands and Switzerland enacted certain provisions in 2023. The Netherlands enacted an Income Inclusion Rule (\"IIR\") and Qualified Domestic Top Up Tax (\"QDMTT\"), effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023, and an Under Taxed Payments Rule (\"UTPR\"), effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2024. Switzerland enacted a QDMTT, effective beginning January 1, 2024. As such, Bunge will be subject to the global minimum corporate tax rate in all of its jurisdictions beginning in 2024. Bunge does not expect a material impact in 2024.\nF-40\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n15.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nBunge's various financial instruments include certain components of working capital such as trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. Additionally, Bunge uses short- and long-term debt to fund operating requirements. Trade accounts receivable, Trade accounts payable and Short-term debt are generally stated at their carrying value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value. See\nNote 3- Trade Structured Finance Program\nfor trade structured finance program,\nNote 12- Other Non-Current Assets\nfor long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil, net and other long-term investments,\nNote 17- Short-term Debt and Credit Facilities\nfor Short-term debt,\nNote 18- Long-term Debt\nfor Long-term debt, and\nNote 19- Employee Benefit Plans\nfor employee benefit plans. Bunge's financial instruments also include derivative instruments and marketable securities, which are stated at fair value.\nFor a definition of fair value and the associated fair value levels, refer to\nNote 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.\nThe following table sets forth, by level, the Company’s assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.\n(1)\nThese receivables and payables are hybrid financial instruments for which Bunge has elected the fair value option as they are derived from purchases and sales of agricultural commodity products in the normal course of business.\n(2)\nUnrealized gains on derivative contracts are generally included i\nn Other current assets. There were\n$\n1\nmillion\nand $\n1\nmillion included in Other non-current assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(3)\nOther includes the fair values of marketable securities and investments in Other current assets and Other non-current assets.\nF-41\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(4)\nUnrealized losses on derivative contracts are generally included in Other current liabilities. There were\n$\n260\nmillion\nand $\n332\nmillion included in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCash equivalents\n—Cash equivalents primarily includes money market funds and commercial paper investments. Bunge analyzes how the prices are derived and determines whether the prices are liquid or less liquid tradable prices. Cash equivalents with liquid prices are valued using prices from publicly available sources and classified as Level 1. Cash equivalents with less liquid prices are valued using third-party quotes or pricing models and classified as Level 2.\nReadily marketable inventories\n—RMI reported at fair value are valued based on commodity futures exchan\nge quotations, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or OTC markets with appropriate adjustments for differences in local markets where the Company's inventories are located. In such cases, the inventory is classified within Level 2. Certain inventories may utilize significant unobservable data related to local market adjustments to determine fair value. In such cases, the inventory is classified as Level 3.\nIf the Company used different methods or factors to determine fair values, amounts reported as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to the reporting date, amounts reported in future periods as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ.\nDerivatives\n—The majority of exchange traded futures and options contracts and exchange cleared contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded agricultural commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables. The Company's forward commodity purchase and sales contracts are classified as derivatives along with other OTC derivative instruments relating primarily to freight, energy, foreign exchange and interest rates and are classified within Level 2 or Level 3, as described below. The Company estimates fair values based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted as appropriate for differences in local markets. These differences are generally valued using inputs from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets. In such cases, these derivative contracts are classified within Level 2.\nOTC derivative contracts include swaps, options, and structured transactions that are generally fair valued using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not highly active, other observable inputs relevant to the asset or liability, and market inputs corroborated by correlation or other means. These valuation models include inputs such as interest rates, prices, and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain OTC derivatives trade in less active markets with less availability of pricing information and certain structured transactions can require internally developed model inputs that might not be observable in or corroborated by the market.\nMarketable securities and investments\n—Comprise foreign government treasury securities, corporate debt securities, deposits, equity securities, and other investments. Bunge analyzes how the prices are derived and determines whether the prices are liquid or less liquid tradable prices. Marketable securities and investments with liquid prices are valued using prices from publicly available sources and classified as Level 1. Marketable securities and investments with less-liquid prices are valued using third-party quotes or internally developed models and classified as Level 2 or Level 3 as described below.\nLevel 3 Measurements\nThe following relates to assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 measurements. An instrument may transfer into or out of Level 3 due to inputs becoming either observable or unobservable.\nLevel 3 Measurements\n—Transfers in and/or out of Level 3 represent existing assets or liabilities that were either previously categorized as a higher level for which the inputs to the model became unobservable or assets and liabilities that were previously classified as Level 3 for which the lowest significant input became observable during the period. Bunge's policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels is to record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.\nLevel 3 Readily marketable inventories and Trade accounts payable\n—The significant unobservable inputs resulting in Level 3 classification for RMI, physically settled forward purchase and sales contracts, and Trade accounts payable relate to certain management estimations regarding costs of transportation and other local market or location-related adjustments, primarily freight related adjustments in the interior of Brazil and the lack of market corroborated information in Canada. In both situations, the Company uses proprietary information such as purchase and sales contracts and contracted prices to value\nF-42\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nfreight, premiums and discounts in its contracts. Movements in the price of these unobservable inputs alone would not be expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements as these contracts do not typically exceed one future crop cycle.\nLevel 3 Derivatives\n—Level 3 derivative instrument fair value measurements utilizes both market observable and unobservable inputs. These inputs include commodity prices, price volatility, interest rates, volumes, and locations.\nLevel 3 Others\n—Primarily relates to marketable securities and investments valued using third-party quotes or pricing models with inputs based on similar securities adjusted to reflect management’s best estimate of the specific characteristics of the securities held by the Company. Such inputs represent a significant component of the fair value of the securities held by the Company, resulting in the securities being classified as Level 3.\nThe tables below present reconciliations for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. These instruments were valued using pricing models that management believes reflect the assumptions that would be used by a marketplace participant.\n(1)\nReadily marketa\nble inventori\nes, derivatives, net, and trade accounts payable include gains/(losses) of $\n978\nmillion, $(\n30\n) million and $\n32\nmillion, respectively, that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains/(losses) relating to Level 3 assets and liabilities still held at December 31, 2023.\n(2)\nComprises the fair values of marketable securities and investments in Other current assets. Certain inputs to the valuation of these securities became observable during the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in the remaining balance being transferred out of Level 3.\nF-43\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(1)\nReadily marketable inventories, derivatives, net, and trade accounts payable\n, includes gains/(losses) of $\n724\nmillion, $\n66\nmillion and $\n47\nmillion, respectively, that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains/(losses) relating to Level 3 assets and liabilities still held at December 31, 2022.\n(2)\nComprises the fair values of marketable securities and investments in Other current assets. Included within Other income (expense) - net of the consolidated statements of income are $\n52\nmillion in mark-to-market losses related to securities still held at December 31, 2022.\n16.\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to manage several market risks, such as interest rate, foreign currency rate, and commodity risk. Some of the hedges the Company enters into qualify for hedge accounting (\"Hedge Accounting Derivatives\") and some, while intended as economic hedges, do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting (\"Economic Hedge Derivatives\"). As these derivatives impact the financial statements in different ways, they are discussed separately below.\nHedge Accounting Derivatives\n-\nThe Company uses derivatives in qualifying hedge accounting relationships to manage certain of its interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity risks. In executing these hedge strategies, the Company primarily relies on the shortcut and critical terms match methods in designing its hedge accounting strategy, which results in little to no net earnings impact for these hedge relationships. The Company monitors these relationships on a quarterly basis and performs a quantitative analysis to validate the assertion that the hedges are highly effective if there are changes to the hedged item or hedging derivative.\nFair value hedges\n- These derivatives are used to hedge the effect of interest rate and currency exchange rate changes on certain long-term debt. Under fair value hedge accounting, the derivative is measured at fair value and the carrying value of hedged debt is adjusted for the change in value related to the exposure being hedged, with both adjustments offset to earnings. In other words, the earnings effect of an increase in the fair value of the derivative will be substantially offset by the earnings effect of the increase in the carrying value of the hedged debt. The net impact of fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swaps is recognized in Interest expense. For cross currency swaps, the changes in currency risk on the derivative are recognized in Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net, and the changes in interest rate risk are recognized in Interest expense. Changes in basis risk are held in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized through the coupon.\nCash flow hedges of currency risk\n- The Company manages currency risk on certain forecasted purchases, sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses with currency forwards. The change in the value of the forward is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the transaction affects earnings, at which time the change in value of the currency\nF-44\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nforward is reclassified to Net sales, Cost of goods sold, or Selling, general and administrative expenses. These hedges mature at various times through December 2024. Of the amount currently in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, $\n2\nmillion of deferred losses is expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months.\nNet investment hedges\n- The Company hedges the currency risk of certain of its foreign subsidiaries with currency forwards for which the currency risk is remeasured through Accumulated other comprehensive loss. For currency forwards, the forward method is used. The change in the value of the forward is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the transaction affects earnings by way of either sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign subsidiary.\nThe table below provides information about the balance sheet values of hedged items and the notional amount of derivatives used in hedging strategies. The notional amount of the derivative is the number of units of the underlying (for example, the notional principal amount of the debt in an interest rate swap).\nThe notional amount is used to compute interest or other payment streams to be made under the contract and is a measure of the Company’s level of activity. The Company discloses derivative notional amounts on a gross basis.\nEconomic Hedge Derivatives -\nIn addition to using derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships, the Company enters into derivatives to economically hedge its exposure to a variety of market risks it incurs in the normal course of operations.\nInterest rate derivatives are used to hedge exposures to the Company's financial instrument portfolios and debt issuances. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is primarily presented in Interest expense.\nCurrency derivatives are used to hedge the balance sheet and commercial exposures that arise from the Company's global operations. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold when hedging commercial exposures and Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net when hedging monetary exposures.\nAgricultural commodity derivatives are used primarily to manage exposures related to the Company's inventory and forward purchase and sales contracts. Contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges. Contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments referred to as forward freight agreements (\"FFA\") and FFA options to hedge portions of its current and anticipated ocean freight costs. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.\nF-45\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Company uses energy derivative instruments to manage its exposure to volatility in energy costs. Hedges may be entered into for natural gas, electricity, coal and fuel oil, including bunker fuel. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.\nThe Company may also enter into other derivatives, including credit default swaps, carbon emission derivatives and equity derivatives to manage exposure to credit risk and broader macroeconomic risks, respectively. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.\nF-46\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe table below summarizes the volume of economic derivatives as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For those contracts traded bilaterally through the over-the-counter markets (e.g., forwards, forward rate agreements (\"FRA\"), and swaps), the gross position is provided. For exchange traded (e.g., futures, FFAs, and options) and cleared positions (e.g., energy swaps), the net position is provided.\nF-47\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Effect of Derivative Instruments and Hedge Accounting on the Consolidated Statements of Income\nThe tables below summarize the net effect of derivative instruments and hedge accounting on the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n(1)\nOther includes the results from freight, energy, and other derivatives.\nF-48\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n17.\nSHORT-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES\nBunge's short-term borrowings are typically sourced from various banking institutions and the U.S. commercial paper market. Bunge also borrows from time to time in local currencies in various foreign jurisdictions. Interest expense includes facility commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs, the impact of designated interest rate hedges, and charges on certain lending transactions. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was\n8.36\n% and\n15.53\n%, respectively.\n(1)\nIncludes $\n179\nmillion and $\n207\nmillion of local currency borrowings in certain European, South American, and Asia-Pacific countries at a weighted average interest rate of\n15.30\n% and\n32.12\n% as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes secured debt of $\n196\nmillion and $\n54\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n(3)\nVariable interest rate range on short-term lines of credit as of December 31, 2023.\nPrior to June 21, 2023, Bunge conducted most of its third party financing activities through a centralized financing structure that included a master trust (the \"Bunge Master Trust\"). On June 21, 2023, Bunge terminated the Bunge Master Trust in accordance with a termination and lien release agreement in order to simplify the legal framework around its capital structure. Post termination of the Bunge Master Trust, Bunge continues to conduct most of its third party financing activities centrally through 100% owned finance subsidiaries which carry full, unconditional guarantees of the parent company. In connection with the termination of the Bunge Master Trust, Bunge amended its existing credit agreements and related guarantees to remove all references and provisions related to the Bunge Master Trust, as well as made amendments to certain credit facilities as discussed further below.\nAlso on June 21, 2023, Bunge entered into an unsecured $\n1.1\nbillion\n364\n-day revolving credit agreement (the \"$\n1.1\nBillion 2024 Credit Agreement\") with a group of lenders, maturing on June 19, 2024. Bunge may from time to time request one or more of the existing or new lenders to increase the total participations under the $\n1.1\nBillion 2024 Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount up to $\n250\nmillion, subject to lender approval, pursuant to an accordion provision. Borrowings will bear interest at Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus a SOFR adjustment and applicable margin as defined in the $\n1.1\nBillion 2024 Credit Agreement. The $\n1.1\nBillion 2024 Credit Agreement replaced an existing $\n1.1\nbillion\n364\n-day revolving credit agreement scheduled to mature July 14, 2023. Bunge had\nno\nborrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, under the $\n1.1\nBillion 2024 Credit Agreement and the predecessor agreement, respectively.\nFurther, on June 21, 2023, Bunge amended its $\n1.35\nbillion\n5-year\nrevolving credit agreement to increase total commitments under the facility to $\n1.95\nbillion (the \"$\n1.95\nBillion Credit Agreement\"). Bunge may from time to time request one or more of the existing or new lenders to increase the total participations under the $\n1.95\nBillion Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount up to $\n1.5\nbillion pursuant to an accordion provision. Borrowings will bear interest at SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment and applicable margin as defined in the $\n1.95\nBillion Credit Agreement. Bunge had\nno\nborrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, under the $\n1.95\nBillion Credit Agreement and the predecessor agreement, respectively.\nBunge had\nno\nborrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, under the unsecured $\n865\nmillion Revolving Credit Facility (the \"$\n865\nMillion 2026 Facility\") with a group of lenders, set to mature on October 29, 2026. Borrowings will bear interest at SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment and applicable margin, as defined in the $\n865\nMillion 2026 Facility.\nOn October 6, 2023, Bunge terminated the unsecured $\n1.75\nbillion revolving credit facility, set to mature on December 16, 2024 (\"Terminated $\n1.75\nBillion Revolving Credit Facility\"). Bunge replaced the Terminated $\n1.75\nBillion Revolving Credit Facility by entering into an unsecured $\n1.75\nbillion revolving credit facility (\"$\n1.75\nBillion Revolving Credit Facility\"),\nF-49\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nwith a group of lenders, maturing on October 6, 2026. Bunge may from time to time, with the consent of the agent, request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments in an amount not to exceed $\n1.75\nbillion pursuant to an accordion provision. Bunge has the option to request an extension of the maturity date of the $\n1.75\nBillion Revolving Credit Facility for\ntwo\nadditional\none-year\nperiods. Borrowings under the $\n1.75\nBillion Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment, which will vary from\n0.05\n% to\n0.25\n% based on the tenor of the interest period selected, plus a margin, which will vary from\n0.25\n% to\n0.90\n%, based on the senior long-term unsecured debt rating provided by Moody’s Investors Services Inc. (\"Moody’s\") and S&P Global Ratings (\"S&P\"). The applicable margin is also subject to certain premiums or discounts tied to certain sustainability criteria, including, but not limited to, SBTs that define Bunge’s climate goals within its operations and a commitment to eliminate deforestation in its supply chains in 2025. Bunge had\nno\nborrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, under the unsecured $\n1.75\nBillion Revolving Credit Facility and the predecessor agreement, respectively.\nBorrowings under the committed revolving credit facilities described above typically have an original maturity of three months or less, resulting in net presentation of proceeds and repayments of short-term debt in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2023, Bunge had $\n5,665\nmillion unused and available committed borrowing capacity comprising committed revolving credit facilities with a number of financial institutions. At December 31, 2022, Bunge had $\n6,665\nmillion unused and available committed borrowing capacity comprised of committed revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program with a number of financial institutions, totaling $\n5,665\nmillion, and $\n1,000\nmillion in committed unsecured delayed draw term loans (see\nNote 18- Long-term Debt)\n.\nOn June 21, 2023, Bunge terminated its existing $\n600\nmillion asset-backed commercial paper program and its related liquidity and letter of credit facilities. To continue access to the commercial paper market, Bunge established a new $\n1\nbillion unsecured corporate commercial paper program (the \"$\n1\nBillion Commercial Paper Program\"). S&P and Moody's assigned short-term ratings of A-2 and P-2, respectively. The short-term credit ratings of the $\n1\nBillion Commercial Paper Program require Bunge to keep same day unused committed borrowing capacity under its long-term committed credit facilities in an amount greater or equal to the amount of commercial paper issued and outstanding. The $\n1\nBillion Commercial Paper Program has no maturity date. At December 31, 2023, there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the $\n1\nBillion Commercial Paper Program. At December 31, 2022, there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under Bunge’s prior commercial paper program and its related liquidity and letter of credit facilities. Borrowings under the $\n1\nBillion Commercial Paper Program typically have an original maturity of three months or less, resulting in net presentation of proceeds and repayments of short-term debt in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn addition to the committed facilities discussed above, from time to time, Bunge Global SA and/or its financing subsidiaries may enter into uncommitted bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on its financing requirements. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines. Loans under such credit lines are non-callable by the respective lenders. In addition, Bunge's operating companies had $\n797\nmillion and $\n546\nmillion in short-term borrowings outstanding from local bank lines of credit at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to support working capital requirements. The original maturity of borrowings under uncommitted bilateral credit lines and local bank lines of credit varies based upon the Company's financing objectives. As a result, proceeds and repayments of such credit lines may be presented on a net basis, or separately, in the consolidated statements of cash flows as dictated by the borrowing's original maturity.\nBunge's credit facilities require it to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and limitations on secured indebtedness. Bunge was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2023.\nF-50\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n18.\nLONG-TERM DEBT\nLong-term debt obligations are summarized below. Variable interest rates are as of December 31, 2023.\n(1)\nOn October 6, 2023, Bunge prepaid and terminated its\n5-year\nterm loan agreement due in 2024.\n(2)\nUpon maturity in June 2023, Bunge repaid the principal and accrued interest due on all of the issued and outstanding\n1.85\n% Senior Notes - Euro.\n(3)\nIncludes secured debt of $\n4\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n(4)\nIncludes secured debt of $\n100\nmillion and $\n21\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe fair values of long-term debt, including current portion, are calculated based on interest rates currently available on comparable maturities to companies with credit standing similar to that of Bunge.\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of long-term debt are as follows:\nAs described in\nNote 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions\n, Bunge has secured a total of $\n8.0\nbillion in Acquisition Financing in the form of a $\n7.7\nbillion financing commitment from a consortium of lenders, arranged by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a $\n300\nmillion\n5-year\ndelayed draw term loan from CoBank and the U.S. farm credit system executed July 7, 2023 that may be drawn upon the closing of the Acquisition. The $\n7.7\nbillion financing commitment is in the form of a\nthree\ntranche term loan maturing\n364\n-days,\n2-years\nand\n3-years\nfrom closing of the Acquisition.\nOn August 5, 2022, Bunge entered into an unsecured $\n250\nmillion delayed draw term loan (the \"$\n250\nMillion February 2023 Delayed Draw Term Loan\") with a group of lenders that was required to be drawn by February 2, 2023. The $\n250\nMillion February 2023 Delayed Draw Term Loan bears interest at SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment and applicable margin, as defined in the $\n250\nMillion February 2023 Delayed Draw Term Loan agreement. The $\n250\nMillion February 2023 Delayed Draw Term Loan was drawn on February 2, 2023 and matures on August 5, 2027.\nF-51\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOn July 26, 2022, and later amended on October 7, 2022, Bunge entered into an unsecured $\n750\nmillion delayed draw term loan (the \"$\n750\nMillion Delayed Draw Term Loan\") with a group of lenders giving Bunge the option to draw the loan by January 25, 2023. The $\n750\nMillion Delayed Draw Term Loan bears interest at SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment and applicable margin, as defined in the $\n750\nMillion Delayed Draw Term Loan agreement. The $\n750\nMillion Delayed Draw Term Loan was drawn on January 25, 2023 and matures on October 24, 2025.\nOn February 23, 2022, Bunge issued a notice of redemption for all of the issued and outstanding\n4.35\n% Senior Notes due March 15, 2024. The redemption of the\n4.35\n% Senior Notes occurred on March 10, 2022. In connection with the redemption, for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $\n47\nmillion charge within Interest expense, of which $\n31\nmillion related to a \"make-whole\" provision based on the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the\n4.35\n% Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the March 10, 2022 redemption date, and $\n16\nmillion related to the recognition of unrealized mark-to-market losses on terminated and de-designated interest rate hedges.\nCertain of Bunge's term loans require it to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and limitations on secured indebtedness. Bunge was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2023.\nCertain property, plant and equipment, and investments in consolidated subsidiaries having a net carrying value of approximately $\n125\nmillion at December 31, 2023 have been mortgaged or otherwise collateralized against long-term debt, including current portion, of $\n104\nmillion at December 31, 2023.\nPrincipal Maturities\n—\nPrincipal maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2023 are as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes components of long-term debt attributable to unamortized premiums of $\n16\nmillion and excludes components\nof long-term debt attributable to fair value hedge accounting of $\n260\nmillion. Includes principal maturities of long-term debt attributable to finance leases, see\nNote 26- Leases\nfor a separate breakout of finance lease maturities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, Bunge paid interest, net of interest capitalized, of $\n507\nmillion, $\n403\nmillion, and $\n285\nmillion, respectively.\n19.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nCertain of Bunge's United States, Canadian, European, Asian, and Brazilian-based subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees of such subsidiaries. The plans provide benefits primarily based on participant salaries and lengths of service. The funding policies for Bunge's defined benefit pension plans are determined in accordance with statutory funding requirements. The most significant defined benefit plan is in the United States.\nCertain of Bunge's United States and Brazilian-based subsidiaries have benefit plans to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible retired employees of those subsidiaries. The plans require minimum retiree contributions and define the maximum amount the subsidiaries will be obligated to pay under the plans. Bunge's policy is to fund these costs as they become payable.\nPlan amendments and pension liability adjustments\n—On September 19, 2017, Bunge approved changes to certain U.S. defined benefit pension plans. As a result, these plans were closed to new employees hired on or after January 1, 2018 and future benefit accruals for existing participants ceased effective January 1, 2023.\nF-52\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nPlan Settlements\n—\nOn June 30, 2023, the Company approved a one-time lump sum offering to participants in certain of Bunge's defined benefit North American pension plans who had separated from the Company as of December 31, 2022 and whose benefits in the plan had fully vested. The respective payments were substantially completed during September 2023. The payments, which were paid from plan assets as settlement of respective benefit obligations, resulted in a $\n22\nmillion decrease in benefit obligations and the reclassification of an unamortized gain of less than $\n1\nmillion from Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was recorded in Other income (expense) - net on the consolidated statements of income.\nOn February 28, 2022, the Company, together with plan participants and related employee unions, agreed to the transition of one of the Company’s international defined-benefit pension plans to a multi-employer pension plan. Following the transition, the Company accounts for the multi-employer plan similar to a defined contribution plan, resulting in full settlement of the related defined-benefit plan obligations.\nIn connection with the settlement, during the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a\n$\n41\nmillion pretax gain within Other income (expense) - net in its consolidated statements of income, comprising a $\n4\nmillion settlement of the related defined benefit plan obligations as well as the reclassification of $\n37\nmillion in unamortized actuarial gains from Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Of this pretax gain, $\n12\nmillion was attributable to Redeemable non-controlling interests.\nPlan Transfers In and Out\n—\nThere were\nno\nsignificant transfers into or out of Bunge's employee benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nCost of Benefit Plans\n—Service cost is recognized in a period determined as the actuarial present value of benefits\nattributed by the pension benefit formula to services rendered by employees during that period. Interest cost is the amount recognized in a period determined as the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. Amortization of net loss represents the recognition in net periodic cost over several periods of amounts previously recognized in Other comprehensive income. Service cost is included in the same income statement line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, while the other components of net periodic benefit pension cost are presented separately in Other (expense) income- net.\nThe components of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\nAssumptions used in Postretirement Be\nnefits Calculations\n—At December 31, 2023, an\n8.8\n%\nannual rate of increase in the per capita cost of c\novered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2023 postretirement benefit plan measurement purposes, decreasing to\n8.2\n% by 2048, a\nnd remaining at th\nat level thereafter. At December 31, 2022, an\n7.7\n% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2022 postretirement benefit plan measurement purposes, decreasing to\n7.1\n% by 2048, and remaining at that level thereafter.\nF-53\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe weighted-average actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligation under the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\nThe weighted-average actuarial assumptions used in determining the net periodic benefit cost under the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\nThe sponsoring subsidiaries select the expected long-term rate of return on assets in consultation with their investment advisors and actuaries. These rates are intended to reflect the average rates of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide required plan benefits. The plans are assumed to continue in effect as long as assets are expected to be invested.\nIn estimating the expected long-term rate of return on assets, appropriate consideration is given to historical performance for the major asset classes held, or anticipated to be held, by the applicable plan trusts and to current forecasts of future rates of return for those asset classes. Cash flows and expenses are taken into consideration to the extent that the expected returns would be affected by them. As assets are generally held in qualified trusts, anticipated returns are not reduced for taxes.\nFor certain of Bunge’s plans, the discount rate is determined by 1) the yield on a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flow effectively settles the year-by-year projected benefit cash flows or 2) matching either the duration or the expected cash flows for the pension plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed on a region-specific basis using a portfolio of available high quality, non-callable, make-whole corporate bonds.\nF-54\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nPension Benefit Obligations and Funded Status\n—\nThe following table sets forth in aggregate the changes in the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans' benefit obligations, assets and funded status at December 31, 2023 and 2022. A measurement date of December 31 was used for all plans.\nF-55\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIncluded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are the following amounts, net of tax and excluding noncontrolling interest, which have not been recognized in net periodic benefit costs:\nBunge has aggregated certain defined benefit pension plans for which the projected benefit obligations exceeds the fair value of related plan assets with pension plans for which the fair value of plan assets exceeds related projected benefit obligations.\nThe following table provides aggregated information about pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the defined pension benefit plans\nwas\n$\n818\nmillion\na\nnd $\n799\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes information related to aggregated defined benefit pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:\nPension Benefit Plan Assets\n—The objective of the plans' trust funds is to sufficiently diversify plan assets to maintain a reasonable level of risk without imprudently sacrificing returns.\nFor pension plans in the United States (the \"US plans\"), Bunge has an outside investment advisory firm to implement a liability-driven investment strategy intended to increase the duration of pension plan assets to better match the duration of pension benefit obligations. This strategy is intended to increase the interest rate and credit spread liability hedge ratios and reduce the funded status volatility of the US plans. For the largest US plan, derivatives are used primarily to manage risk and hedge plan li\nabilities while maintaining liquidity. As part of this strategy, the plan is required to hold cash collateral associated with certain derivatives. Target asset allocations are based on a glide path approach, which allocates more plan assets to immunizing assets, such as intermediate and long duration fixed income instruments, which are intended to match the duration and amount of the expected liabilities, and less to growth assets, such as public equities, non-core fixed income instruments and real assets, as the funded status of the plans improve. Target asset allocations are generally\n70\n-\n90\n% to immunizing assets and\n10\n-\n30\n% to growth assets. For pension plans outside of the United States, the plans’ trust funds utilize a target asset allocation of approximately\n30\n% fixed income securities, approximately\n35\n% equities and approximately\n35\n% in real estate and other alternative investment vehicles.\nBunge implements its investment strategy through a combination of passive and actively managed strategies, including, but not limited to mutual funds, collective trust funds, and collective investment trusts. The Company's policy is not to invest plan assets in Bunge\nGlobal SA\nshares. Plan investments are stated at fair value or net asset value (\"NAV\"). For a further definition of fair value and the associated fair value levels, refer to\nNote 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nF-56\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe fair values of Bunge's defined benefit pension plans' assets at the measurement date, by category, are as follows:\n(1)\nThis category represents a portfolio of equity investments comprised of equity index funds that invest in U.S. equities and non-U.S. equities. The U.S. equities are comprised of investments focusing on large, mid and small cap companies and non-U.S. equities are comprised of international, emerging markets, and real estate investment trusts.\n(2)\nThis category represents a portfolio of fixed income investments in mutual funds comprised of investment grade U.S. government bonds and notes, foreign government bonds, and corporate bonds from diverse industries.\n(3)\nThis category represents a portfolio consisting of a mixture of hedge funds, investments in certain government and municipal securities, bonds, real estate, and insurance contracts.\n(4)\nCollective pooled funds are typically collective trusts valued at NAV that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Using the practical expedient in\nASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements\n, these investments are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy, but are included in the table above so that they can be reconciled to the line items presented in the consolidated balance sheets.\nBunge expects to contri\nbute\n$\n24\nmillion\nand\n$\n4\nmillion\nto its d\nefined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively, in 2024.\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid in relation to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans:\nF-57\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nEmployee Defined Contribution Plans\n—Bunge also makes contributions to qualified defined contribution plans for eligible employees. Contributions to these plans amount\ned to\n$\n43\nmillion\n, $\n28\nmillion\n, and $\n17\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n20.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nBunge purchases agricultural commodity products from certain of its unconsolidated investees and other related parties. Such related party purchases comprised appro\nximatel\ny\n9\n% or less of total Cost of goods sold for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. Bunge also sells agricultural commodity products to certain of its unconsolidated investees and other related parties. Such related party sales comprised approximately\n1\n% or\nless of total Net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nIn addition, Bunge receives services from and provides services to its unconsolidated investees, including tolling, port handling, administrative support, and other services. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, such services were not material to the Company's consolidated results.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, receivables related to the above related party transactions comprised approximatel\ny\n3\n% or less of total Trade accounts receivable, net. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, payables related to the above related party transactions comprised approximately\n5\n%\nor less of total Trade\naccounts payable.\nFurther, as referenced in\nNote 6- Other Current Assets\nand\nNote 12- Other Non-Current Assets\n, Bunge provides certain advance payments for future delivery of specified quantities of agricultural commodities and advances to its unconsolidated investees. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, advances to unconsolidated investees comprised approximat\nely\n3\n% or less of total Other current assets and\n5\n% or le\nss of total Other non-current assets.\nBunge believes all transaction values to be similar to those that would be conducted with third parties.\n21.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nBunge is party to claims and lawsuits, primarily non-income tax and labor claims in South America, arising in the normal course of business. Bunge is also involved from time to time in various contract, antitrust, environmental litigation and remediation, and other litigation, claims, government investigations and legal proceedings. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties. Bunge records liabilities related to legal matters when the exposure item becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Bunge management does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on Bunge’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the remote possibility that a liability arising from these matters could have a material adverse impact in the period the uncertainties are resolved should the liability substantially exceed the amount of provisions included in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are the following amounts related to these matters:\nF-58\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nBrazil indirect taxes - non-income tax claims -\nThese tax claims relate to claims against Bunge’s Brazilian subsidiaries, primarily value-added tax claims (ICMS, ISS, IPI and PIS/COFINS) plus applicable interest and penalties on the outstanding amount.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Brazilian federal and state authorities have concluded examinations of the ICMS and PIS/COFINS tax returns and have issued outstanding claims. The Company continues to evaluate the merits of each of these claims and will recognize them if and when loss is considered probable. The outstanding claims comprise the following:\nLabor claims\n— The labor claims are principally against Bunge’s Brazilian subsidiaries. The labor claims primarily relate to dismissals, severance, health and safety, salary adjustments, and supplementary retirement benefits.\nCivil and other claims\n— The civil and other claims relate to various disputes with third parties, including suppliers, and customers.\nGuarantees\n—Bunge has issued or was a party to the following guarantees at December 31, 2023:\n(1)\nBunge has issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of its unconsolidated affiliates. The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings, which have maturity dates through 2034. There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable Bunge to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. In addition, certain Bunge subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates and in connection therewith have secured their guarantee obligations through a pledge to the financial institutions of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates' shares plus loans receivable from the unconsolidated affiliates in the event that the guaranteed obligations are enforced.\nBased on the a\nmounts drawn under guaranteed debt facilities of unconsolidated affiliates at December 31, 2023, Bunge's potential liability was\n$\n83\nmillion, and it has recorded less than $\n1\nmillion of o\nb\nligations related to these guarantees within Other non-current liabilities.\n(2)\nBunge has issued guarantees to certain financial institutions that are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars, barges and buildings. These guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at the conclusion of the lease term. These leases expire at various dates from 2024 through 2029. At December 31, 2023,\nno\nobligation has been recorded related to these guarantees. Any obligation recorded would be re\ncognized in Current\noperating lease obligations or Non-current operating lease obligations.\n(3)\nOn February 3, 2023, Bunge agreed to indemnify the buyer of its Russian operations against certain existing legal claims involving Bunge's former Russian subsidiary. The indemnity expires on February 2, 2030. As of December 31, 2023, Bunge recorded a $\n9\nmillion obligation related to this indemnity within Other non-current liabilities.\nBunge Global SA has provided a guarantee to the Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture as Trustee for Bunge North America, Inc. (\"BNA\"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, which guarantees all amounts due and owing by BNA to grain producers and/or depositors in the State of Illinois who have delivered commodities to BNA's Illinois facilities.\nF-59\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nCommitments\n—At December 31, 2023, Bunge had approximately $\n283\nmillion of purchase commitments related to inventories, $\n507\nmillion of freight supply agreements for ocean freight vessels and railroad freight lines not accounted for as leases, $\n97\nmillion of power supply contracts, $\n219\nmillion of contractual commitments related to construction in progress, and $\n509\nmillion of other purchase commitments and obligations, such as take-or-pay contracts, throughput contracts, and debt commitment fees.\nBunge has also entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Amounts on outstanding standby letter of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated to $\n1,858\nmillion and $\n1,592\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n22.\nOTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES\nOther non-current liabilities consist of the following:\n(1)\nSee\nNote 19- Employee Benefit Plans.\n(2)\nSee\nNote 14- Income Taxes.\n(3)\nSee\nNote 15- Fair Value Measurements.\n23.\nEQUITY\nRedomestication\n— In connection with the Redomestication noted in\nNote 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies\n, one registered share, par value $\n0.01\nper share, of Bunge Global SA was exchanged for,  each issued and outstanding Bunge Limited common share, par value $\n0.01\nper share. In connection with the non-cash exchange, Bunge Global SA acquired\n16,141,494\ntreasury shares which, following the Redomestication, are available for future use in satisfying Bunge’s obligations to deliver registered shares.\nTreasury Shares\n— In connection with the Redomestication noted in\nNote 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies\n,\n8,102,179\nshares held in treasury with an acquisition cost of\n$\n845\nmillion were cancelled in a non-cash transaction to comply with the Swiss Code limitation on issuer’s holding of registered share capital.\nShare Repurchase Program\n— On June 12, 2023, Bunge Limited's Board of Directors approved the expansion of an existing $\n500\nmillion program for the repurchase of our issued and outstanding common shares. At the time, approximately $\n300\nmillion of capacity for the repurchase of Bunge Limited common shares remained available under the existing program and Bunge Limited's Board of Directors approved the expansion of the program by an additional $\n1.7\nbillion, for an aggregate unutilized capacity of $\n2.0\nbillion at June 12, 2023. The program continues to have an indefinite term. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Bunge repurchased\n5,407,861\nshares for $\n600\nmillion.\nAs of December 31, 2023,\n7,516,976\nshares were repurchased for $\n800\nmillion and\n$\n1.4\nbillion remained outstanding for repurchases under the program.\nSubsequent to the consolidated balance sheet date, from December 31, 2023 through February 21, 2024, Bunge repurchased an additional\n3,319,987\nshares for $\n301\nmillion. Therefore, as of February 21, 2024,\n10,836,963\nshares were repurchased for $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion remains outstanding for repurchases under the program.\nCumulative Convertible Perpetual Preference Shares\n—\nEffective March 23, 2022, (the \"Conversion Date\"), in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designation governing the\n4.875\n% Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preference Shares (“convertible preference shares”), all of the Company's issued and outstanding convertible preference shares were automatically converted into\n1.2846\ncommon shares of the Company, par value $\n0.01\nper share. There were\n6,898,268\nconvertible preference shares issued and outstanding prior to the conversion, which resulted in the issuance of\n8,861,515\nnew common shares of the Company. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2022, prior to the conversion,\n1,415\nconvertible preference\nF-60\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nshares were voluntarily converted by preference shareholders into\n1,816\ncommon shares. As a result of this conversion, no convertible preference shares were issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, and all rights of the former holders of the convertible preference shares terminated, as of March 23, 2022.\nDividends on the convertible preference shares ceased to accrue on the Conversion Date. Accordingly, holders of the convertible preference shares were not entitled to receive the $\n1.21875\nper share dividend declared by the Company in respect of the convertible preference shares on February 23, 2022, and payable to holders of record on May 15, 2022.\nDividends on registered or common shares\n—On October 31, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $\n0.6625\nper share, payable on March 1, 2024, to shareholders of record on February 16, 2024. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared total dividends on shares of $\n2.6125\nper share.\nDividend distributions occurring after the Redomestication are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and the approval of shareholders at a general meeting in accordance with Swiss law. Upon approval by shareholders, the obligation will be reflected in Other current liabilities with a corresponding reduction in Retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet. Bunge expects to make dividend distributions in four equal quarterly installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\nAttributable to Bunge\n—\nThe following table summarizes the balances of related after-tax components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to Bunge:\nF-61\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(1)\nBunge has significant operating subsidiaries in Brazil, Argentina, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The functional currency of Bunge's subsidiaries is generally the local currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at month-end exchange rates, and the resulting foreign currency translation gains (losses) are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n(2)\nOn February 28, 2022, the Company, together with plan participants and related employee unions, agreed to the transition of one of the Company's international defined benefit pension plans to a multi-employer pension plan. Following the transition, the Company accounts for the multi-employer plan similar to a defined contribution plan, resulting in full settlement of the related defined benefit plan obligations.\nIn connection with the settlement, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company reclassified $\n27\nmillion (net of $\n10\nmillion tax expense) in unamortized actuarial gains from Accumulated other comprehensive loss, of which $\n19\nmillion was attributable to Bunge (net of $\n7\nmillion in tax expense), and $\n8\nmillion was attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest (net of $\n3\nmillion in tax expense).\nThe year ended December 31, 2022 also included the release of cumulative translation adjustments upon the disposition of substantially all of its wheat milling business in Mexico of $\n158\nmillion, which had been previously reserved through Cost of goods sold, in the consolidated statements of income in the year ended December 31, 2021 (see\nNote 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions\n).\n(3)\nThe year ended December 31, 2023 included the release of cumulative translation adjustments upon the disposition of all of its Russian operations of $\n103\nmillion, which had been previously reserved through Cost of goods sold, in the consolidated statements of income in the year ended December 31, 2022 (see\nNote 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions\n).\nF-62\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n24.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nShare information provided below, including references to Net income available to Bunge shareholders, Weighted-average number of shares outstanding, and Earnings per share have been calculated based on Bunge’s common shares prior to the Redomestication and Bunge’s registered shares after the Redomestication.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\n(1)\nThe weighted-average shares outstanding-diluted exclude less than\n1\nmillion contingently issuable restricted stock units, which were not dilutive and not included in the computation of earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n(2)\nEffective March 23, 2022, in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designation governing the convertible preference shares, all of the Company's issued and outstanding convertible preference shares were automatically converted into\n1.2846\ncommon shares of the Company, par value $\n0.01\nper share. As a result of this conversion, dividends on the convertible preference shares ceased to accrue on the Conversion Date. Accordingly, holders of the convertible preference shares were not entitled to receive the $\n1.21875\nper share dividend declared by the Company in respect of the convertible preference shares on February 23, 2022, and payable to holders of record on May 15, 2022, and no convertible preference shares were issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Refer to\nNote 23- Equity\nfor further information.\nF-63\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n25.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nIn connection with the Redomestication effective as of November 1, 2023, Bunge amended the Bunge Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2016 EIP\"), the Bunge 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, and the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2017 NED Plan\" or collectively, referred to as the \"Plans\") to provide for the issuance of registered shares instead of common shares in connection with the awards under the Plans. Additionally, the amendments to the Plans include changes to comply with Swiss law regarding minimum payment for shares, share sourcing, the form of shares, data protection, and forfeiture of restricted shares along with modifying the vesting provision on the 2017 NED Plan for separation.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, Bunge recognized approximately $\n69\nmillion, $\n65\nmillion, and $\n61\nmillion, respectively, of total compensation expense related to its stock option and restricted stock unit equity awards.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, Bunge granted equity awards under the 2016 EIP, a shareholder approved plan. Under the 2016 EIP, the Compensation Committee of Bunge's Board of Directors may grant equity-based awards to officers, employees, consultants, and independent contractors in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (performance-based or time-based) or other equity-based awards. Shares issued under the 2016 EIP may result from, in whole or in part, the capital band referenced in Bunge's articles of association, treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner, or a combination thereof.\nStock Option Awards—Options to purchase Bunge registered shares are granted with an exercise price equal to the grant date fair market value of Bunge registered shares, vest over service periods that generally range from\none\nto\nthree years\nand expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant. Vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the plans or associated award agreements. Grant date fair value is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis for option grants, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Bunge elected to cease awarding stock options to its employees beginning January 1, 2021.\nAny awards previously granted will continue to vest as awarded.\nRestricted Stock Units—Restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") give recipients the right to receive shares of Bunge registered shares upon the lapse of related restrictions determined by the Compensation Committee. The Company has two types of RSUs: time-based restricted stock units (\"TBRSUs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PBRSUs\"). Restrictions on TBRSUs are based on continued service by the recipient through the designated term. Restrictions on PBRSUs are based on the achievement of certain performance targets, including earnings per share, return on invested capital, and relative total shareholder return, with the number of PBRSUs earned varying based on the level of achievement against these performance targets. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for restricted stock units. RSUs generally vest over periods ranging from\none\nto\nthree years\n. Vesting may be accelerated under certain circumstances as defined in the plans or associated award agreements. RSUs are generally settled in shares of Bunge registered shares upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting terms, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. In locations where share settlement may be prohibited under local law, RSUs are settled in cash. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit will also be entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments.\nUnder the 2017 NED Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant equity-based awards to non-employee directors of Bunge Global SA. Awards may consist of restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units, and non-statutory stock options.\nRestricted stock units granted to non-employee directors generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, provided the director continues to serve on the Board until such date, and are settled in shares of Bunge registered shares. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit is also entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend distribution equivalent share payments.\nThe fair value of each stock option granted under any of the Plans is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, utilizing inputs such as the expected volatility of Bunge registered shares, historical employee exercise behavior, the expected outstanding option term, and the risk-free interest rate associated with U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds.\nF-64\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nA summary of option activity under the Plans for the year ended December 31, 2023 is presented below:\n(1)\nIncludes\n15,020\noptions to be cash settled.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was approximately $\n5\nmillion, $\n44\nmillion, and $\n30\nmillion, respectively.\nA summary of restricted stock unit activity under the Plans for the year ended December 31, 2023 is presented below.\n(1)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, Bunge issued a total of\n687,444\ncommon and registered shares, net of shares withheld to cover taxes, including related shares representing accrued dividends, with a weighted-average fair value of $\n46.62\nper share upon vesting of TBRSUs and PBRSUs.\n(2)\nIncludes accrued unvested dividends, which are payable in Bunge's registered shares upon vesting of underlying restricted stock units.\n(3)\nIncludes\n17,145\nTBRSUs to be cash settled.\nAt December 31, 2023, there was approximately $\n83\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units granted under the Plans, which is expected to be recognized over the next\nthree years\nyears. The total grant date fair value of restricted stock units vested during the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $\n46\nmillion.\nRegistered Shares Reserved for Share-Based Awards\n—The 2017 NED Plan and the 2016 EIP provide that\n320,000\nand\n10,900,000\nregistered shares, respectively, are to be reserved for grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other awards under the plans. During 2021, Bunge shareholders approved an increase to the 2017 NED Plan of\n200,000\nshares, which is reflected in the figures above. At December 31, 2023,\n150,669\nand\n2,692,269\nregistered shares were available for future grants\nF-65\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nunder the 2017 NED Plan and the 2016 EIP, respectively. No shares are currently available for grant under any other Bunge Global SA equity incentive plan.\n26.\nLEASES\nThe Company routinely leases storage facilities, transportation equipment, land, and office facilities which are typically classified as operating leases. The accounting for some of the Company's leases may require significant judgment when determining whether a contract is or contains a lease, the lease term, and the likelihood of renewal or termination options.  Leases with an initial term of more than 12 months are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets (Operating lease assets) and lease liabilities for the obligation to make payments under such leases (Current operating lease obligations and Non-current operating lease obligations). As of the lease commencement date, the lease liability is initially measured as the present value of lease payments not yet paid. The lease asset is initially measured equal to the lease liability and adjusted for lease payments made at or before lease commencement (e.g., prepaid rent), lease incentives, and any initial direct costs. Over time, the lease liability is reduced for lease payments made and the lease asset is reduced through expense, classified as either Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expense depending upon the nature of the lease. Lease assets are subject to review for impairment in a manner consistent with property, plant and equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (\"short-term leases\") are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company’s operating\nleases range in length of term, with a weighted average remaining lease term of\n8.2\nyears\n, and a maximum remaining term of\n88\nyears for\none water rights lease\n. Renewal options are generally exercisable solely at the Company’s discretion. When a renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised, such additional terms are considered when calculating the associated operating lease asset and liability. When determining the lease liability at commencement of the lease, the present value of lease payments is generally based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate determined using a portfolio approach and the Company’s inc\nremental cost of debt, adjusted to arrive at the rate in the applicable country and for the applicable term of the lease, as the rate implicit in the lease is generally not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2023, such weighted average discount rate on operating leases was\n5.0\n%\n.\nCertain of the Company’s freight supply agreements for ocean freight vessels and rail cars\nmay include rental payments that are variable in nature. Variable payments on time charter agreements for ocean freight vessels under freight supply agreements are dependent on then current market daily hire rates. Variable payments for certain rail cars can be based on volumes, and in some cases, benchmark interest rates. All such variable payments, other than those that depend on an index or rate, are not included in the calculation of the associated operating lease asset or liability subsequent to the inception date of the associated lease and are recorded as expense in the period in which the adjustment to the variable payment obligation is incurred. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements related to railcars and barges contain residual value guarantees (see\nNote 21- Commitments and Contingencies\n). None of the Company’s lease agreements contain material restrictive covenants.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nF-66\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe table below presents the finance lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n(1)\nComprises both operating and finance lease obligations.\nMaturities of operating and finance lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n(1)\nMinimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income receipts of $\n115\nmillion due in future periods under non-cancelable subleases as of December 31, 2023. Non-cancelable subleases primarily relate to agreements with third parties for the use of portions of certain facilities with remaining sublease\nterms of up to\nsix years\n.\nAdditionally, from time to time, the Company may enter into re-let agreements to sell the right to use ocean freight vessels under time charter agreements when excess capacity is available.\nSublease income, generally recorded within Net sales, was $\n176\nmillion and $\n335\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe Company is expected to have additional operating leases, primarily for ocean freight vessels that have not yet commenced, of $\n364\nmillion over the lives of the leases. The operating leases are expected to commence in 2024 and 2025, with lease terms ranging between\ntwo\nand\nseven years\n.\nF-67\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n27.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company's operations are organized, managed, and classified into\nfour\nreportable segments - Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy, organized based upon their similar economic characteristics, products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Corporate and Other.\nThe Agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. The Refined and Specialty Oils segment involves the processing, production, and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. The Milling segment involves the processing, production, and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. The Sugar & Bioenergy segment primarily comprises the net earnings from the Company’s\n50\n% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP.\nCorporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to the Company’s individual reporting segments because the operating performance of each reporting segment is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance activities, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.\nTransfers between the segments are generally valued at market.\nThe segment revenues generated from these transfers are shown in the following table as \"Inter-segment revenues.\"\nF-68\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(1)\nIncludes Net (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests adjusted for noncontrolling interests' share of interest and taxes.\n(2)\n2023 EBIT includes a mark-to-market gain of $\n29\nmillion, recorded in Cost of goods sold, related to inventory recovered from Bunge's Mykolaiv and other facilities in Ukraine; $\n37\nmillion of fixed asset impairment charges in North America, recorded in Cost of goods sold; $\n17\nmillion of amortization charges, at Bunge's\n80\n% share, recorded in SG&A, primarily related to the discontinuance of the\nLoders Croklaan\ntrademark; $\n114\nmillion of acquisition and integration costs, recorded in SG&A, related to the announced Business Combination Agreement with Viterra; $\n20\nmillion impairment charge, recorded in Other income (expense) - net, related to the full impairment of a long-term investment held in Other non-current assets; and a $\n16\nmillion impairment charge, recorded in Income from affiliates, related to a minority investment in Australian Plant Proteins, a start-up manufacturer of novel protein ingredients.\n(3)\n2022 EBIT includes $\n80\nmillion of charges resulting from the Ukraine-Russia war, recorded in Cost of goods sold, primarily related to losses associated with inventories physically located in occupied territories in Ukraine or in difficult to access locations with high costs of recovery; $\n106\nmillion of charges on the classification of our Russian oilseed processing business as held-for-sale, recorded in Cost of goods sold; a $\n29\nmillion gain, at Bunge's then-\n70\n% share, related to the settlement of\none\nof the Company’s international defined benefit pension plans, recorded in Other\nF-69\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nincome (expense) - net; and $\n53\nmillion of charges related to the impairment of\ntwo\nequity investments, recorded in Income from affiliates.\n(4)\n2021 EBIT includes a $\n158\nmillion gain on sale of a portfolio of interior grain elevators located in the United States\n(U.S. Grain Disposition), recorded in Other income (expense) - net; $\n170\nmillion in gains on sales of assets, comprising a $\n151\nmillion gain on sale of our Rotterdam Oils Refinery, at Bunge’s then-\n70\n% share, and a $\n19\nmillion gain on sale of an oils packaging facility in Mexico, both recorded in Other income (expense) - net; a $\n35\nmillion fixed asset impairment charge, at Bunge’s then-\n70\n% share, recorded in Cost of goods sold; and a $\n170\nmillion expense related to the classification of our Mexican wheat milling business as held-for-sale, recorded in Cost of goods sold.\nTotal segment earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") is an operating performance measure used by Bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. Bunge's management believes total segment EBIT is a useful measure of operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. In addition, EBIT is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge's industries.\nA reconciliation of Net income attributable to Bunge to Total segment EBIT follows:\nNet sales by product group to external customers were as follows:\nGeographic area information for Net sales to external customers, determined based on the location of the subsidiary making the sale, and long-lived assets follows:\nF-70\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(1)\nLong-lived assets comprise Property, plant and equipment, net.\nAs further described in\nNote 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n, the Company’s revenue comprises sales from commodity contracts that are accounted for under ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n(ASC 815)\nand sales of other products and services that are accounted for under ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n(ASC 606).\nThe following tables provide a disaggregation of Net sales to external customers between sales from commodity contracts (ASC 815) and sales from contracts with customers (ASC 606):\nF-71\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n28.\nQUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\n(1)\nEarnings per share attributable to Bunge shareholders for both basic and diluted is computed independently for each period presented.
