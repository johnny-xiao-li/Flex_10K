    "text": "GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS\nAbbott Laboratories is an Illinois corporation, incorporated in 1900. Abbott’s* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products.\nNARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nAbbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.\nEstablished Pharmaceutical Products\nThese products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and sold outside the United States in emerging markets. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers or public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with, or licensed from, other companies.\nThe principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are:\n•\ngastroenterology products, including Creon™, for the treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency associated with several underlying conditions, including cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis; Duspatal™ and Dicetel™, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome or biliary spasm; Heptral™, Transmetil™, and Samyr™, for the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis (associated with liver disease) or depressive symptoms; and Duphalac™, for regulation of the physiological rhythm of the colon;\n•\nwomen’s health products, including Duphaston™, for the treatment of many different gynecological disorders; and Femoston™, a hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women;\n•\ncardiovascular and metabolic products, including Lipanthyl™ and TriCor™, for the treatment of dyslipidemia; Teveten™ and Teveten™ Plus, for the treatment of essential hypertension, and Physiotens™, for the treatment of hypertension; and Synthroid™, for the treatment of hypothyroidism;\n•\npain and central nervous system products, including Serc™, for the treatment of Ménière’s disease and vestibular vertigo; Brufen™, for the treatment of pain, fever, and inflammation; and Sevedol™, for the treatment of severe migraines; and\n•\nrespiratory drugs and vaccines, including the anti-infective clarithromycin (sold under the trademarks Klacid™, Claribid™, and Klaricid™); and Influvac™, an influenza vaccine.\nThe Established Pharmaceutical Products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building strong brands with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers.\nCompetition in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures.\n________________________________________________________\n*\nAs used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the term “Abbott” refers to Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\n1\nDiagnostic Products\nThese products include a broad line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, clinics, physicians’ offices, retailers, government agencies, alternate care testing sites, and plasma protein therapeutic companies from Abbott-owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors.\nThe principal products included in the Diagnostic Products segment are:\n•\ncore laboratory and transfusion medicine systems in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and transfusion serology testing, including the Alinity\n®\nfamily of instruments along with the ARCHITECT\n®\nand Cell-Dyn\n®\nsystems.

Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products.\nNutritional Products\nThese products include a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to consumers and to institutions, wholesalers, retailers, health care facilities, government agencies, and third-party distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers or third-party distributors.\nThe principal products included in the Nutritional Products segment are:\n•\nvarious forms of infant formula and follow-on formula, including Similac\n®\n, Similac\n®\n360 Total Care\n®\n, Similac Pro-Advance\n®\n, Similac\n®\nAdvance\n®\n, Similac\n®\n360 Total Care\n®\nSensitive, Similac\n®\nSensitive, Go & Grow by Similac\n®\n, Similac\n®\nNeoSure\n®\n, Similac\n®\nOrganic, Similac\n®\nSpecial Care\n®\n, Similac Total Comfort\n®\n, Similac\n®\nSoy Isomil\n®\n,  Similac\n®\nAlimentum\n®\n, EleCare\n®\n, Gain™, and Grow™;\n•\nadult and other pediatric nutritional products, including Ensure\n®\n, Ensure Plus\n®\n, Ensure\n®\nEnlive\n®\n, Ensure\n®\n(with NutriVigor™), Ensure\n®\nMax Protein, Ensure\n®\nHigh Protein, Glucerna\n®\n, Glucerna\n®\nHunger Smart\n®\n, ProSure™, PediaSure\n®\n, PediaSure SideKicks\n®\n, PediaSure\n®\nPeptide, Juven\n®\n, Abound™, Pedialyte\n®\nand Zone Perfect\n®\n; and\n•\nnutritional products used in enteral feeding in health care institutions, including Jevity\n®\n, Glucerna\n®\n1.2 Cal, Glucerna\n®\n1.5 Cal, Osmolite\n®\n, Oxepa\n®\n, Freego™ (Enteral Pump) and Freego™ sets, Nepro\n®\n, and Vital\n®\n.\nPrimary marketing efforts for nutritional products are directed toward consumers or to securing the recommendation of Abbott’s brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. In addition, nutritional products are also promoted directly to the public by consumer marketing efforts in markets where permitted.\n2\nCompetition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers’ products may increase competitive pressure.\nMedical Devices\nThese products include a broad line of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally marketed and sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians’ offices, and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.\nThe principal products included in the Medical Devices segment are:\n•\nrhythm management products, including Assurity MRI\n®\nand Endurity MRI\n®\npacemaker systems, and Aveir\n®\nsingle-chamber (VR and AR) and Aveir\n®\ndual chamber (DR) leadless pacemaker systems; Ellipse\n®\n, Fortify Assura\n®\n, and Gallant\n®\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillators and Gallant and Quadra Assura MP\n®\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillator with cardiac resynchronization therapy and MultiPoint™ Pacing technology; and Confirm Rx\n®\n, Jot Dx\n®\nand Assert-IQ\n®\nimplantable cardiac monitors;\n•\nelectrophysiology products, including the TactiFlex\n®\nand TactiCath\n®\nfamilies of ablation catheters, and FlexAbility\n®\nirrigated ablation catheters; EnSite\n®\nfamily of cardiac mapping systems; Agilis\n®\nNxT and Swartz™ introducer catheters; the Advisor\n®\nHD Grid mapping catheter; and ViewFlex\n®\nfamily of intracardiac echocardiography catheters;\n•\nheart failure related products, including the HeartMate\n®\nleft ventricular assist device family; the CardioMEMS\n®\nHF System pulmonary artery sensor, a heart failure monitoring system; the CentriMag\n®\nSystem, an acute mechanical circulatory support system; and patient self-testing products and services;\n•\nvascular products, including the XIENCE\n®\nfamily of drug-eluting coronary stent systems developed on the Multi-Link Vision\n®\nplatform; StarClose SE\n®\n, Perclose ProGlide\n®\nand Perclose ProStyle\n®\nvessel closure devices, TREK\n®\ncoronary balloon dilatation products, Hi-Torque Balance Middleweight Universal II\n®\nguidewires, Supera\n®\nPeripheral Stent System, a peripheral vascular stent system; Acculink\n®\n/Accunet\n®\nand Xact\n®\n/Emboshield NAV6\n®\n, carotid stent systems; the OPTIS\n®\nintegrated systems with Ultreon™ 1.0 and 2.0 Software, compatible with the Dragonfly OPTIS\n®\nand OpStar\n®\nimaging catheters and PressureWire\n®\nfractional flow reserve measurement systems; the JETi\n®\nperipheral thrombectomy systems for clot removal; and Diamondback 360\n®\ncoronary and peripheral orbital atherectomy systems;\n•\nstructural heart products, including MitraClip\n®\n, a mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system; TriClip\n®\n, a tricuspid valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system; Epic\n®\n, a surgical family of aortic valve and mitral valve replacement devices; Portico\n®\nand Navitor\n®\ntranscatheter aortic heart valves; Regent™ and Masters Series\n®\nmechanical heart valves; Amplatzer\n®\nPFO occluders; Amplatzer Amulet\n®\noccluder devices; and the Tendyne\n®\ntranscatheter mitral valve replacement system;\n•\ncontinuous glucose and blood glucose monitoring systems under the FreeStyle\n®\nbrand such as the FreeStyle Libre\n®\nsystem, including sensors, data management decision software, test strips, and accessories for people with diabetes; and\n•\nneuromodulation products, including spinal cord stimulators Proclaim\n®\nPlus and Proclaim\n®\nXR recharge-free implantable pulse generators (IPG) and rechargeable Eterna\n®\nIPG, each with BurstDR\n®\nstimulation, and Proclaim\n®\nDRG IPG, a neurostimulation device designed for dorsal root ganglion therapy, for the treatment of chronic pain disorders; and the Infinity\n®\nDeep Brain Stimulation System with directional lead technology for the treatment of movement disorders.\n3\nThese products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products.\nINFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT’S BUSINESS IN GENERAL\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nAbbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott’s operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world. After several years of challenges to the global supply chain caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions such as inflationary pressures and labor shortages, Abbott's global supply chain has improved. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies. A more detailed discussion on the global supply chain challenges and its resulting impact on Abbott’s business is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in the \"Financial Review” section in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nPatents, Trademarks, and Licenses\nAbbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott’s products in the United States and countries of interest to Abbott. Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 4. These, and various patents that expire during the period 2024 to 2044, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott’s business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, or trademark is material in relation to Abbott’s business as a whole.\nSeasonal Aspects, Customers, and Renegotiation\nThere are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott’s business. Abbott has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on Abbott. No material portion of Abbott’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAbbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal, state, and various other countries’ environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott’s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2023 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2024.\nAbbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nHuman Capital\nThe sustainability of Abbott’s business depends on attracting, engaging and developing talented people with diverse backgrounds who share Abbott’s mission to help people live their healthiest possible lives. Abbott provides its employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers, market competitive compensation and benefit programs, and the satisfaction of being part of a global company dedicated to improving health in more than 160 countries.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Abbott employed approximately 114,000 people, 69% of whom were employed outside of the U.S. Women represented 47% of Abbott’s U.S. workforce, 46% of its global workforce, and 42% of its managers.\n4\nTalent Management\nAbbott has an integrated global talent management process that is designed to identify and assess talent across the organization and provide equal and consistent opportunities for employees to develop their skills. All levels of employees participate in Abbott’s annual performance management process to create development plans that support their particular career objectives, and Abbott provides a broad range of training, mentoring and other development opportunities to help its employees meet these objectives. The board of directors conducts an annual Talent Management Review, focusing on development of talent, diversity, and succession planning for critical positions. Similar reviews take place across Abbott to develop talent and diversity across the organization.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nAbbott is committed to developing a workplace that is inclusive for all. Abbott ties executive compensation to human capital management, including diversity outcomes, to sustain an inclusive culture and the fair and balanced treatment of Abbott’s employees. In 2023, Abbott released the third edition of its diversity, equity, and inclusion report, providing an update on Abbott’s plans, strategies, and actions to fulfill its commitment to develop an inclusive workplace.\nAbbott’s employee networks play an important role in building an inclusive culture across all Abbott operations. A corporate officer serves as a sponsor for each of these networks, helping to align their objectives with Abbott’s business strategies. Abbott has ten such networks, which are: Asian Leadership and Cultural Network, Black Business Network, disABILITY Network (supporting employees with disabilities), Early Career Network (supporting early career employees), Flex Network (supporting employees with part-time and flexible schedules), LA VOICE Network (supporting Hispanic and Latino employees), PRIDE (supporting LGBTQ employees), Veterans Network, Women Leaders of Abbott, and Women in STEM. All networks are open to all Abbott employees.\nAbbott offers professional development programs, which provide recent college graduates the opportunity to rotate through different areas of Abbott, often with the chance to work outside their home country. In 2023, 58% of the participants were women. Also, Abbott hosts hundreds of college students for paid internships. In 2023, 59% of the U.S. interns were women and 61% were minorities. Further, Abbott has offered a STEM internship program for high school students in the U.S. since 2012 and since 2021, students who complete the program receive a college credit recommendation from the American Council on Education. The program’s objective is to increase the number of students pursuing STEM-related careers and contribute to a more diverse talent pipeline for Abbott. In 2023, 74% of the STEM interns were women and 84% were minorities.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health, safety and wellness of its employees is an Abbott priority embedded at every level of its business. Abbott’s integrated Environmental, Health and Safety organization governs health, safety and wellness at Abbott’s facilities. Abbott also maintains global policies and standards for managing employee health and safety.\nAbbott takes a holistic approach to employee well-being. Abbott’s global wellness programs are designed to meet the unique needs of employees across businesses and geographies and offer a wide range of programs, including supporting the emotional, physical, and financial health of employees and their families. For example, for over 20 years, Abbott has annually offered Exercise Across Abbott, which is a four-week physical wellness program that encourages employees to team up with colleagues and track how many minutes they exercise each day. Over 28,000 Abbott employees across 75 countries took part in 2023.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAbbott is committed to building, retaining, and motivating a diverse talent pipeline that can meet the current and future needs of its businesses. To that end, Abbott provides market competitive compensation, healthcare benefits, continuing education benefits, pension and/or retirement savings plans, financial support for employees with student loan debt, and several programs to facilitate employees building an ownership stake in Abbott, including a global long-term incentive program for employees generally beginning at the manager level. Abbott also has procedures and processes focused on ensuring employees receive equitable compensation, regardless of race or gender or other personal characteristics.\n5\nRegulation\nThe development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott’s products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott’s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections.\nDuring the COVID-19 public health emergency, many pandemic-related products (including diagnostic tests) were authorized by regulators for emergency use during the pandemic. In addition, many governments enacted policies to expedite or promote access to health care in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus. Examples included expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing. The U.S. federal public health emergency expired on May 11, 2023, which has not impacted the availability of the products authorized under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA). Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory approval process for various COVID-19 diagnostic tests, because the FDA could revoke or terminate its EUAs.\nAbbott will continue to monitor further regulatory actions from relevant U.S. government agencies and assess potential impacts on pandemic-related government policies and product authorizations.\nAbbott’s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott’s investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products.\nAbbott’s laboratory facilities, home monitoring services, and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to third-party payors. In the United States, Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria.\nAbbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott’s business. Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Devices Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory’s certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties.\nAbbott’s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.\n6\nAccess to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Abbott expects that insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products. Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, or coverage limitations. Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott’s products for the foreseeable future. In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices, diagnostics, supplies, and other products, as well as the procedures in which these products may be used. The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time. For example, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies. Additionally, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act established a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests in 2018.\nGovernmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott’s nutritional products business. In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula. As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. In October 2018, the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required, beginning with reports filed in 2022. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.\nPolicy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems. In the United States, this could include potential modification, including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information, financial information and other sensitive personal information), is increasing. For example, the European Union, China, various other countries, and various U.S. states (e.g., California, Virginia, and Colorado) have enacted or are considering enacting data protection laws that contain significant compliance obligations and financial penalties for noncompliance. In addition, regulators with general consumer protection authority, such as the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. states Attorneys General, are focused on how consumer data is used by entities in the health care industry. Further, there are regulations of data privacy and security that are specific to health care companies. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws, which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties. Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area.\nAbbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture, quality assurance requirements, marketing authorization processes, post-market surveillance requirements, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security. Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market, access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above.\n7\nINTERNET INFORMATION\nCopies of Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available, free of charge, through Abbott’s investor relations website (\nwww.abbottinvestor.com\n) as soon as reasonably practicable after Abbott electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission).

    "text": "In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results. Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nDisruptions to Abbott’s global supply chain, which is large and complex, could negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations\n.\nAbbott’s operations and performance depend on its ability to manage its large and complex global supply chain. While Abbott has taken and will continue to take actions to mitigate the risks of disruptions to its global supply chain, disruptions to it could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions such as inflationary pressures and labor shortages contributed to global supply chain challenges over the last few years, which adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. A discussion on the global supply chain challenges and its resulting impact on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.\nAbbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.\nFrom time to time, Abbott pursues acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or may dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity.\nAbbott depends on sophisticated information systems and maintains protected personal data, and a significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption affecting these information systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products make them susceptible to a cybersecurity incident, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cybersecurity incidents. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product availability, functionality or safety, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.\nAbbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.\n9\nAbbott invests in its information systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of a cybersecurity incident or other significant disruption, and monitors its information systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential cybersecurity threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future cybersecurity incidents or other significant disruptions to any of the information systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers or other partners with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant cybersecurity incident or disruption that impacts Abbott. Any significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption affecting Abbott’s information systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAbbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline.\nTo remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.\nPromising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer.\nThe manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers or manufacturers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer.\nThe manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or the global supply chain, failure to meet product specifications, cybersecurity incidents, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, time and expense spent investigating the cause and remediating the problem, if any, a production stoppage at a manufacturing facility, and depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers or manufacturers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.\nAbbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $14.7 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.\nFurther, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.\n10\nAdditionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIt is costly for Abbott to comply with numerous governmental regulations and to develop compliant products and processes, and consequences for non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\nAbbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, consent decrees, seizures of Abbott’s products, and civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution.\nThese actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy any actual or potential issues; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For information on Abbott’s voluntary recall in February 2022 of certain powder infant formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan, the manufacturing stoppage at such facility, and the consent decree that Abbott entered into with the FDA on May 16, 2022, see the discussion in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.\nLaws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\nAbbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\nChanges in the health care regulatory environment may adversely impact the demand for and price of Abbott’s products.\nBoth in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them.\n11\nFurther, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\nFor additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.”\nThe expiration or loss of intellectual property protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income.\nMany of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.”\nSignificant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition.\nHealth care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. When new safety concerns are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety concerns arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product have been and could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety concerns affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured and could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\nEconomic, Geopolitical and Industry Risks\nAbbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.\nIn the United States and other countries, Abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on certain product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “Regulation.” To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced.\nCompetitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of patent litigation, such as competitor claims that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.\n12\nNew products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.\nAbbott’s products face intense competition from competitors' products and technological advances. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products. Further, the development of new technology, health care products and medicines, and the development of new treatments for disease could significantly change the competitive landscape of the health care industry and negatively impact the demand for certain Abbott products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products and technological advances.\nFluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect Abbott’s financial statements and its ability to realize projected sales and earnings.\nAlthough Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2023 made up approximately 61 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.\nInformation on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this report. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this report.\nAdverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations, both in the U.S. and internationally, could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations.\nAbbott is a large, global corporation, and changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations could adversely affect Abbott’s overall tax liabilities. Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations, both in the U.S. and internationally, such as the two-pillared plan proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD), could materially adversely affect Abbott’s effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations. A discussion on the OECD proposals and their potential impact on Abbott’s business in the future is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report. Abbott is unable to predict what changes to the tax laws of the U.S. or other jurisdictions may be proposed or enacted in the future or what impact such changes would have on its business.\nDeterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.\nUnfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables or inhibit Abbott's ability to best utilize its cash. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems.\nAbbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact certain Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause, and during the COVID-19 pandemic caused, significant reductions in demand for certain products, increased difficulty in serving customers, disruptions to manufacturing and supply chains, and negative effects on certain of Abbott’s operations as well as the operations of its suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact, and during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted, the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, inflation rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to global supply chain disruptions, which adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services.\n13\nWith regard to COVID-19 diagnostic testing, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for several COVID‑19 related products in 2020 and 2021, including Abbott diagnostic tests. EUAs are authorized pursuant to an EUA Declaration under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and remain in effect until the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services terminates the EUA Declaration or unless sooner terminated or revoked. Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory approval process for various COVID-19 diagnostic tests, which has uncertainty as discussed in “\nAbbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.\n” in “Legal and Regulatory Risks” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” The U.S. federal public health emergency (PHE) expired on May 11, 2023, which has not impacted the availability of the products authorized under the EUAs. Abbott will continue to monitor further regulatory actions from relevant U.S. government agencies and assess potential impacts on pandemic-related government policies and product authorizations. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted to an endemic state, resulting in significantly lower demand for COVID-19 tests.\nA more detailed discussion on the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.\nThe international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.\nAbbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2023 made up approximately 61 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott’s international operations include:\n•\ndiffering local product preferences and product requirements;\n•\ntrade protection measures, including tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, other governmental restrictions such as trade sanctions, and changes to international trade agreements;\n•\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;\n•\ndiffering labor regulations;\n•\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n•\ngeopolitical and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;\n•\nrestrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;\n•\nprice controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;\n•\ninflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;\n•\ndiminished protection of intellectual property; and\n•\npotential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nEvents contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.\nOther factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.\nMany other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including:\n•\nchanges in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product approval standards, product labeling standards, source and use laws, and environmental laws;\n•\ndifferences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;\n•\nchanges in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, labor, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott’s equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;\n14\n•\nchanges in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;\n•\nchanges in business, economic, and geopolitical conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; global climate change, extreme weather and natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;\n•\nchanges in Abbott’s business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, and changing product mix;\n•\nchanges in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, wholesaler, or other customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and\n•\nlegal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.\nMany of these factors may manifest individually or collectively, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which resulted in political instability, sanctions, economic and currency volatility, inflation and other operational and supply disruptions. To date, Abbott has been able to manage these disruptions without material impact to its results of operations. However, it is difficult to predict the future implications and consequences of the situation on local, regional or global economies and Abbott’s operations. There could be additional sanctions, economic volatility, cybersecurity threats, political instability, transportation and other supply disruptions, as well as collection default or liquidity risks or limited availability of resources to conduct essential business processes that could have a material adverse impact to Abbott’s operations and financial condition. The resolution and long-term impact of this matter are uncertain and difficult to predict.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, and projections. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “could,” “may,” variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Certain factors, including but not limited to those identified under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, estimates, projections, forecasts, and from past results. No assurance can be made that any expectation, estimate, or projection contained in a forward-looking statement will be achieved or will not be affected by the factors cited above or other unknown or future events. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as the result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law."

    "text": "Risk Management and Strategy\nAbbott’s\ncybersecurity risk management process is designed to identify and assess\ninternal and external cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities to and within Abbott’s business and operations, and analyze and prioritize risks from cybersecurity threats to inform strategies and action plans aimed at mitigating and managing these risks.\nAbbott’s cybersecurity program utilizes a variety of technical and process controls that are designed to identify, protect against, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats, including:\n•\ndedicated cybersecurity professionals who are responsible for analyzing cybersecurity threats, defining cybersecurity policy and requirements, implementing protections, and monitoring and responding to cybersecurity incidents;\n•\nperiodic cybersecurity awareness training for relevant employees and contractors\non Abbott policies and emerging cybersecurity threats, including phishing awareness training;\n•\ninternal and third party cybersecurity testing,\nincluding penetration testing of Abbott’s information systems and hardware;\n15\n•\ncybersecurity risk assessments for Abbott’s systems and applications;\n•\ncybersecurity monitoring and response processes intended to identify, assess, escalate, investigate, contain, and remediate incidents; and\n•\ndisaster recovery plans.\nIn addition, risks from cybersecurity threats are integrated into Abbott’s enterprise risk management (ERM) program. The ERM program establishes a risk management framework that seeks to identify and assess risks that could materially impact Abbott’s business and operations.\nAs part of Abbott’s cybersecurity program, Abbott regularly engages with assessors and third party advisers to perform various services, including assessments of process design and operating effectiveness; security testing and attestation; periodic assessment of enterprise cybersecurity maturity; industry benchmarking; and thought leadership related to continuous improvement of processes, training, technology, and data.\nAbbott’s cybersecurity program also aims to identify and assess cybersecurity risks associated with its use of third party service providers with access to Abbott’s systems and data, as well as such third party service providers’ adherence to certain cybersecurity standards and processes. As appropriate, Abbott requires such third party service providers to agree to be subject to cybersecurity evaluations by Abbott.\nA discussion of how Abbott’s business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by risks from cybersecurity threats is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors under\n“Abbott depends on sophisticated information systems and maintains protected personal data, and a significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption affecting these information systems or protected personal data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\"\nGovernance\nThe board of directors has risk oversight responsibility for Abbott, which it administers directly and with assistance from its committees. Throughout the year, the board and its committees engage with management to discuss a wide range of enterprise risks.\nThe audit committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to ERM, including risks from cybersecurity threats, and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate those risks. The audit committee receives reports semiannually from Abbott’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) on Abbott’s cybersecurity strategy and program. In addition, the audit committee conducts an annual review of the ERM process, including the program structure, risk assessment, and risk mitigation.\nThe public policy committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to product cybersecurity, and receives reports at least annually on this topic from the CIO and CISO.\nThe CISO\nleads Abbott’s cybersecurity strategy and program and its cybersecurity and privacy incident response team that is responsible for monitoring the detection of cybersecurity incidents and executing Abbott’s cybersecurity incident response process, as needed. Pursuant to the process, the team is responsible for the investigation and resolution of cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to an Abbott senior management-level committee on detection, mitigation, and remediation of significant cybersecurity incidents. The CISO reports to the CIO, who has overall responsibility for the cybersecurity program and organization.\nAbbott has two cross-functional senior management-level committees that assess Abbott’s material risks from cybersecurity threats – one that oversees Abbott’s cybersecurity program and another that oversees the cybersecurity incident response process.\nThe CISO has extensive technology work experience, having served in various roles in risk management, including information security audit and assessments, developing cybersecurity strategy/programs for enterprise and product security, and cybersecurity operations focused on identification, mitigation and response to cybersecurity threats. The CISO has also held leadership positions in several health sector industry organizations developing cybersecurity standards and best practices.\nThe CIO has extensive technology work experience at S&P 100 companies overseeing and executing technology strategies in complex, global, highly matrixed environments. The CIO provides executive leadership on technology strategy, policy, and capabilities across the Abbott enterprise.\n16"

    "text": "Abbott is involved in various claims, legal proceedings, and investigations, including (as of January 31, 2024) those described below. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nAbbott is a defendant in numerous lawsuits involving certain of its specialty infant formula products administered to preterm infants. The lawsuits allege that preterm infants developed necrotizing enterocolitis as a result of being administered a cow’s milk-based preterm infant formula product, which resulted in personal injuries or death. As of January 31, 2024, there were 993 lawsuits pending in federal and state courts in which Abbott is a party. The plaintiffs seek various damages, including punitive damages. In April 2022, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered all federal court cases consolidated for pretrial purposes in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In addition, in December 2021, a purported class of Canadian preterm infants filed suit in British Columbia and, in October 2022, a purported class of Israeli preterm infants filed suit in Tel Aviv, both of which make similar allegations as those made in the United States against Abbott. These plaintiffs seek various damages. In January 2024, the Israeli lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice.\nMany of the lawsuits name another infant formula manufacturer as a co-defendant.\nIn June and July 2021, DexCom, Inc. (DexCom) initiated patent infringement litigation against Abbott over certain of Abbott's continuous glucose monitoring products, including those under the FreeStyle brand, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and in the Regional Court of Mannheim in Germany. In both jurisdictions, DexCom seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages. In all cases, Abbott asserts that it has a license to each of Dexcom' s asserted patents and that the patents are invalid and not infringed. In July 2021, Abbott sued DexCom for patent infringement over certain of DexCom’s continuous glucose monitoring products in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, the Regional Courts of Mannheim and Dusseldorf in Germany, and the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom. Abbott seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages. In December 2021, Abbott filed a breach of contract suit against DexCom in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that DexCom breached the parties' 2014 Settlement and License Agreement by asserting infringement of patents against Abbott that DexCom previously licensed to Abbott. In July 2023, Abbott was found to have a license to certain of DexCom’s patents in Abbott’s breach of contract suit.\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office found some of DexCom’s asserted patent claims invalid. Throughout 2023, Abbott and DexCom filed additional patent infringement actions in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Spain, and the Unified Patent Court. DexCom’s first U.S. patent infringement trial on its remaining claims is scheduled for March 2025. Abbott’s first U.S. patent infringement trial against DexCom is scheduled for March 2024.\nIn November 2022, Abbott learned that the United States Department of Justice, through the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan, is conducting a criminal investigation related to Abbott’s manufacturing of infant formula. In December 2022, Abbott received a subpoena from the Enforcement Division of the Commission requesting information relating to Abbott’s powder infant formula business and related public disclosures. In January 2023, Abbott received a civil investigative demand from the United States Federal Trade Commission seeking information in connection with its investigation of companies who participate in bids for Women, Infants, and Children infant formula contracts. In addition, multiple civil lawsuits have been filed against Abbott relating to Abbott’s manufacturing of certain powder infant formula products."

    "text": "Financial Review\nAbbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products, which include medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. These products are sold under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and the measurement of net sales and costs is impacted by foreign currency translation. Sales in international markets comprise 61 percent of consolidated net sales.\nOver the period from 2020 through 2023, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways. Abbott’s Diagnostics segment experienced the most significant change in sales from 2020 to 2023 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. (The Diagnostics segment includes the Rapid Diagnostics, Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics businesses.) After mobilizing its teams across multiple fronts in 2020 and 2021, Abbott developed and launched multiple types of new diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19. Tests were launched in the U.S. pursuant to Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) and in countries outside of the U.S. pursuant to CE Marks.\nDuring the pandemic, COVID-19 testing-related sales grew to 17.8 percent and 19.2 percent of Abbott's sales in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nAbbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $7.7 billion in 2021 and $8.4 billion in 2022, led by sales related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Panbio and ID NOW rapid testing platforms. D\nemand for COVID-19 tests was volatile during the pandemic as the number of COVID-19 cases, especially in the U.S., fluctuated during this period.\nIn 2023, the pandemic shifted to an endemic state and the U.S. federal public health emergency expired, resulting in significantly lower demand for COVID-19 tests. In 2023, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $1.6 billion, of which $730 million occurred in the first quarter of 2023.\nDemand for COVID-19 tests is expected to continue to be unpredictable in 2024.\nWith respect to other products sold by the Diagnostics segment, demand for routine diagnostic testing generally fluctuated throughout the pandemic with changes in the number of COVID-19 cases in various geographic regions.\nAcross Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses, procedure volumes were negatively impacted during the pandemic by surges of COVID-19 in various geographies as well as intermittent COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and healthcare staffing challenges. Despite such challenges, overall volume trends improved in several cardiovascular businesses and in routine diagnostic testing in 2022 and that growth continued in 2023. While Abbott’s branded generic pharmaceuticals business was also negatively affected by the pandemic in 2020 as COVID-19 spread across emerging market countries, volumes recovered and grew over the 2021 to 2023 period. Abbott’s nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic.\nWhile Abbott’s total sales over the last three years were most significantly affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales over this period also reflect the introduction of new products across various businesses, as well as higher sales of various existing products. Sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 38 percent of total company sales, increased 5.4 percent in 2023 and 5.6 percent in 2022, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries, except the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Western European countries.)\nIn U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall in February 2022 of certain infant powder formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan and stopped production at the facility. On May 16, 2022, Abbott entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the steps necessary to resume production and maintain the Sturgis facility and operations. On July 1, 2022, Abbott restarted partial production at the facility beginning with its specialty formula EleCare\n®\nand metabolic formulas. Subsequently, Abbott restarted Similac\n®\nproduction. The consent decree does not affect any other Abbott plants or operations.\nIn 2022, Abbott took various actions to mitigate the impact of the recall on the supply of formula in the U.S. The 2022 actions included the shipment of infant formula powder into the U.S. from Abbott's FDA-registered facility in Ireland; prioritization of infant formula production at its Columbus, Ohio facility; conversion of other liquid manufacturing lines into manufacturing Similac liquid ready-to-feed product; increased production of powder infant formula at its Casa Grande, Arizona manufacturing site; and importation of product from its facility in Spain as permitted by the FDA.\nIn 2023, as Abbott's production of infant formula increased in the U.S., Abbott made progress toward recovering market share in this business. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Abbott returned to having the market-leading position in the U.S., as measured on a volume basis.\n22\nOver the last three years, Abbott’s operating margin as a percentage of sales decreased from 19.6 percent in 2021 to 19.2 percent in 2022 and 16.2 percent in 2023. The decrease in 2023 from 2021 reflects the unfavorable effects of lower COVID-19 testing-related sales, foreign exchange, and higher costs for various manufacturing inputs. The decrease in 2022 from 2021 reflects the impact of the voluntary infant product recall and manufacturing stoppage in U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals and the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges on various manufacturing inputs and transportation costs across Abbott's businesses.  In both 2023 and 2022, these unfavorable effects were partially offset by the favorable impact of margin improvement initiatives.\nWhile Abbott experienced availability issues with some services and materials used in its products over the last three years, Abbott was able to manage the various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services, raw materials and supplies. While Abbott experienced inflationary pressures on various raw materials, packaging materials and transportation costs over the last three years, the impact of such cost increases was partially mitigated by price increases in certain businesses and the impact of continued gross margin improvement initiatives.\nWith respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years, sales in the Medical Devices segment, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 15.1 percent in 2023 and 8.1 percent in 2022. The sales increases in 2023 and 2022 were driven by growth in Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, and Structural Heart. The 2023 increase was also driven by growth in Neuromodulation sales.\nIn 2023, operating earnings for the Medical Devices segment increased 19.6 percent. The operating margin profile for the Medical Devices segment decreased from 31.3 percent in 2021 to 30.0 percent in 2022 and then increased to 31.4 percent in 2023. The decrease in 2022 from 2021 reflects various factors, including the impacts of inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges related to various manufacturing inputs and processes. The increase in 2023 from 2022 reflects the impact of higher sales volumes across the Medical Devices businesses.\nIn 2023, key product approvals in the Medical Devices segment included:\n•\nFDA clearance for Navitor, Abbott's second-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation system to treat people with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme risk for open-heart surgery,\n•\nFDA clearance of Abbott's Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system for integration with automated insulin delivery systems,\n•\nFDA approval of Abbott's Epic\n®\nMax stented tissue valve to treat people with aortic regurgitation or stenosis,\n•\nFDA approval of Abbott’s TactiFlex\n®\nAblation Catheter, Sensor Enabled™, the world's first ablation catheter with a flexible electrode tip and contact force sensing technology to treat patients with atrial fibrillation,\n•\nFDA approval of Abbott’s AVEIR\n™\ndual-chamber leadless pacemaker system, the world's first dual chamber leadless pacing system that treats people with abnormal or slow heart rhythms, and\n•\nCE Mark for Abbott’s AVEIR single-chamber leadless pacemaker.\nIn Abbott’s Diagnostics segment, sales decreased 38.2 percent in 2023 and increased 10.4 percent in 2022, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As was discussed above, the 2023 sales decrease was driven by lower demand for Abbott's COVID-19 tests, partially offset by higher routine diagnostics testing in the core laboratory business. The 2022 sales growth was driven by demand for Abbott's portfolio of rapid diagnostics tests for COVID-19 and higher routine diagnostics testing in the core laboratory business, partially offset by lower demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for COVID-19 in the molecular diagnostics business.\nIn 2023, operating earnings for the Diagnostics segment decreased 63.4 percent. The operating margin profile decreased from 40.2 percent in 2021 to 24.4 percent in 2023 primarily due to lower demand for Abbott's COVID-19 tests.\nAbbott has regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, China, and other markets for the “Alinity c” and “Alinity i” instruments and has continued to build out its test menu for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics. Abbott has obtained regulatory approval for the “Alinity h” system for hematology in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other regions. Abbott has also obtained regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe and other markets for the “Alinity s” (blood screening) and “Alinity m” (molecular) instruments and several testing assays. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Abbott received FDA approval of its new laboratory automation system, GLP systems Track™, to help laboratories optimize the performance and safety of diagnostics testing.\n23\nIn Abbott’s Nutritional Products segment, total pediatric nutrition sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 14.8 percent in 2023, which includes market share recovery in the U.S. infant formula business following the voluntary recall of certain products in the prior year. In 2022, pediatric nutrition sales decreased 16.6 percent as a result of the voluntary recall and manufacturing stoppage discussed above, as well as challenging market dynamics in China. In December 2022, Abbott initiated steps to exit its pediatric nutrition business in China. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total adult nutrition sales increased 8.8 percent in 2023 and 4.8 percent in 2022, led by the continued growth of Abbott's Ensure\n®\nand Glucerna\n®\nproducts across several countries.\nIn 2023, operating earnings for the Nutritional Products segment increased 88.9 percent compared to 2022. Operating margins for this segment decreased from 21.3 percent in 2021 to 9.5 percent in 2022 and then increased to 16.4 percent in 2023. The decrease in 2022 was driven by the impact of the voluntary infant product recall and manufacturing stoppage as well as higher manufacturing and distribution costs, including commodity prices, partially offset by the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives. The increase in 2023 reflects the favorable effects of higher sales and a continued focus on gross margin improvement initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity and other costs.\nThe Established Pharmaceutical Products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Established Pharmaceutical sales increased 10.9 percent in 2023 and 10.6 percent in 2022. The sales increases in 2023 and 2022 reflect higher sales in several geographies including India, Vietnam, and Brazil. In 2023, operating earnings for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment increased 15.0 percent. Operating margins increased from 18.8 percent in 2021 to\n23.8 percent in 2023 primarily due to the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives and higher sales, partially offset by inflation on various product inputs.\nWith respect to Abbott’s financial position, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments total approximately $7.3 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively. Abbott’s long-term debt totals $14.7 billion and $16.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAbbott declared dividends of $2.08 per share in 2023 and $1.92 per share in 2022, an increase of\n8.3 percent\n. Dividends paid totaled $\n3.556 billion\ncompared to $3.309 billion in 2022. The year-over-year change in the amount of dividends paid reflects the increase in the dividend rate. In December 2023, Abbott increased the company’s quarterly dividend by\n7.8 percent\nto $0.55 per share from $0.51 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2024. In December 2022, Abbott increased the company’s quarterly dividend by\n8.5 percent\nto $0.51 per share from $0.47 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2023.\nOn September 22, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. (Bigfoot), which will further Abbott's efforts to develop connected solutions for making diabetes management more personal and precise. On April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI). CSI's atherectomy system, which is used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease, adds complementary technologies to Abbott's portfolio of vascular device offerings.\nIn 2024, Abbott will focus on continuing to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years. In its diagnostics business, Abbott's focus will include driving sales growth from its Alinity suite of diagnostics instruments and its portfolio of rapid diagnostic testing systems. In the medical devices business, Abbott will focus on growing recently launched new products and expanding its market position across the various businesses. In its nutritional business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving growth globally and further enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of science-based products and line extensions. In the established pharmaceuticals business, Abbott will continue to focus on growing its business with the depth and breadth of its portfolio in emerging markets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSales Rebates\n— In 2023, 49 percent of Abbott’s consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances in 2023 are in the Nutritional Products and Diabetes Care businesses. Abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate gener\nally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2023, 2022, and 2021 amounted to approximately\n24\n$3.9 billion per year, or 17.4 percent, 17.6 percent, and 17.5 percent of gross sales, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $22.7 billion, $22.4 billion, and $22.3 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $227 million in 2023. Abbott considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $263 million, $280 million, and $268 million for cash discounts in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and $169 million, $379 million, and $211 million for returns in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated be\ncause Abbott’s historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods.\nManagement analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals. In the WIC business, estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott holds the WIC contract. The state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price, is reliably determinable. Rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years. Except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the states submitting rebate claims. The USDA, which administers the WIC program, has been making its data available for many years. Management also estimates the states' processing lag time based on sales and claims data. Management has access to several large customers' inventory management data, which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel. At December 31, 2023, Abbott had WIC business in 40 states.\nHistorically, adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation.\nIncome Taxes\n—\nAbbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items is often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. In accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 were settled as of December 31, 2023. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable.\nPension and Post-Employment Benefits\n— Abbott offers pension benefits and post-employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for years, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. The net actuarial gains for these plans in 2023 reflect the impact of actual asset returns during the year in excess of expected returns, partially offset by the impact of lower discount rates on the measurement of plan liabilities. At December 31, 2023, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were net losses of\n$1.8 billion\nfor Abbott’s defined benefit plans and net losses of $40 million for Abbott’s medical and dental plans. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five-year period.\n25\nValuation of Intangible Assets\n— Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott’s critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter.  An undiscounted net cash flows approach is used to test for impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2023, goodwill amounted to\n$23.7 billion\nand net intangibles amounted to\n$8.8 billion\n. Amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to\n$2.0 billion\nper year in\n2023, 2022\nand\n2021\n. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in\n2023\n,\n2022\n, and\n2021\n.\nLitigation\n— Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $30 million to $45 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Accruals of approximately $40 million have been recorded at December 31, 2023 for these proceedings and exposures. These accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.”\n26\nResults of Operations\nSales\nThe following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years:\nThe decrease in total net sales in 2023 reflects the decline in demand for Abbott’s rapid diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19, partially offset by higher sales in the Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceutical Products and Nutritional Products segments. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $1.6 billion in 2023, $8.4 billion in 2022 and $7.7 billion in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 9.2 percent in 2023. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 11.7 percent. Abbott’s net sales in 2023 were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 3.5 percent and total sales by 2.0 percent.\nThe increase in total net sales in 2022 reflects growth in demand for Abbott’s rapid diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19 as well as growth in the Established Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices segments, partially offset by lower Nutritional Products sales. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales decreased 0.3 percent in 2022. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s 2022 total net sales increased 5.1 percent. Abbott’s net sales in 2022 were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 8.2 percent and total sales by 5.1 percent.\n27\nThe price declines related to the Diagnostic Products segment in 2023 and 2022 primarily reflect lower pricing for COVID-19 tests.\nThe table below provides detail by sales category for the years ended December 31. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.\n28\n________________________________________________________\nTotal Established Pharmaceutical Products sales increased 10.9 percent in 2023 and 10.6 percent in 2022, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.\nExcluding the effect of foreign exchange, sales in Key Emerging Markets for Established Pharmaceutical Products increased 10.3 percent in 2023 and 12.1 percent in 2022, led by growth in several countries\nand across several therapeutic areas,\nincluding cardiometabolic, central nervous system/pain management and respiratory. Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 12.8 percent in 2023\nand 6.1 percent in 2022.\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange, total Nutritional Products sales increased 11.6 percent in 2023 compared to a 6.2 percent decrease in 2022. In U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales, the 26.6 percent increase in 2023 reflects progress in recovering market share in 2023 following the voluntary recall of certain infant formula products in the first quarter of 2022, as well as the unfavorable 2022 impact of the recall, partially offset by a decrease in 2023 Pedialyte\n®\nsales. In 2022, U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales decreased 28.7 percent as a result of the voluntary recall and production stoppage of certain infant powder formula products, partially offset by increased demand for Abbott’s Pedialyte products.\nExcluding the effect of foreign exchange, the 5.2 percent increase in International Pediatric Nutritional sales in 2023 reflects higher sales in Latin America and Canada, partially offset by the impact of exiting the pediatric nutrition business in China. In 2022, the 3.9 percent decrease in International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the impact of the challenging market dynamics in the infant category in China, partially offset by higher sales volumes in several countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America.\n29\nIn 2023 and 2022, U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 5.8 percent and decreased 0.5 percent, respectively. The growth in 2023 was led by higher Ensure\n®\nand Glucerna\n®\nproduct sales. In 2022, the growth of the Ensure brand was offset by lower sales of other products and the impact of temporarily utilizing liquid manufacturing capacity to manufacture infant formula. In 2023 and 2022, International Adult Nutritionals sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased 10.4 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively, led by growth of Ensure\n®\nand Glucerna\n®\nproducts in various countries.\nExcluding the effect of foreign exchange, Diagnostics segment sales decreased 38.2 percent in 2023 and increased 10.4 percent in 2022, driven by changes in demand for COVID-19 tests. Rapid Diagnostics sales decreased 62.9 percent in 2023 and increased 22.8 percent in 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. The decrease in 2023 reflects lower demand for COVID-19 tests across Abbott’s rapid testing platforms\n. Rapid\nDiagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales\nwere $1.5 billion in 2023, $7.9 billion in 2022 and $6.6 billion in 2021.\nIn 2023, Rapid Diagnostics sales were virtually unchanged, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales. Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 1.3 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. Growth in various Rapid Diagnostics products was partially offset by the unfavorable effects of an early 2022 flu season and a later start of the 2023 flu season.\nIn 2022, Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 17.0 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and 20.5 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. These increases reflect higher sales of ID NOW tests for flu, strep, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as well as growth in various other Rapid Diagnostics products.\nIn Core Laboratory Diagnostics, sales increased 8.4 percent in 2023 and 1.9 percent in 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. The increases in 2023 and 2022 were due to higher year-over-year volume of routine diagnostic testing performed in hospitals and other laboratories, partially offset by lower test sales for the detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies. Core Laboratory Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $20 million in 2023, $62 million in 2022, and $204 million in 2021. Excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 6.5 percent in 2023 and decreased 2.0 percent in 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 9.4 percent in 2023 and 4.8 percent in 2022.\nIn Molecular Diagnostics, sales decreased 41.6 percent in 2023 and 27.4 percent in 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In both years the decreases were driven by lower demand for laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19. Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $43 million in 2023, $411 million in 2022 and $891 million in 2021. In 2023, Molecular Diagnostics sales decreased 9.2 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and decreased 8.1 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. 2023 sales were  impacted by lower demand for respiratory testing compared to significantly higher-than-usual demand in 2022. In 2022, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 9.0 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and 13.8 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales.\nExcluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 15.1 percent in 2023 and 8.0 percent in 2022, led by double-digit growth in 2023 in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Heart Failure, Neuromodulation and Electrophysiology. Higher Diabetes Care sales were driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre\n®\n, Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, in the U.S. and internationally. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $5.3 billion in 2023, which reflected a 25.5 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over 2022 when FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $4.3 billion.\nIn 2022, while\nprocedure volumes across Abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses\nwere negatively impacted by surges of COVID-19 in various geographies, as well as intermittent COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in China and healthcare staffing challenges throughout the year, overall volumes improved from 2021 levels.\nIn 2023, the\n15.9 percent\nincrease in Electrophysiology sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, primarily reflects higher procedure volumes in the U.S., China, and various European countries. In 2022, Electrophysiology sales increased 7.3 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to an increase in procedure volumes and the continued roll‑out of Abbott’s EnSite X\n®\nEP System with EnSite Omnipolar Technology (OT), a new cardiac mapping platform available in the U.S., Japan and across Europe.\nIn Neuromodulation, the\n16.4 percent\nincrease in 2023 sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by the recent launch of the Eterna\n®\nrechargeable spinal cord stimulation system for the treatment of chronic pain along with market growth compared to the prior year.\n30\nIn Structural Heart, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the 14.3 percent and\n13.0 percent sales i\nncreases in 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflect continued growth of the MitraClip\n®\nproduct as well as various other products, including Amplatzer\n®\nAmulet\n®\nLeft Atrial Appendage Occluder, Navitor\n®\n, and TriClip\n®\n.\nIn Vascular, the 9.3 percent increase in 2023 sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflects the acquisition of CSI on April 27, 2023, as well as double-digit growth in endovascular sales.\nIn 2022, Vascular sales decreased 1.0 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, as higher endovascular sales were offset by the negative effect of lower average selling prices globally on traditional drug eluting stents (DES) and other coronary products and a lower recovery of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures which impacted the coronary business.\nAbbott’s operations in Russia and Ukraine represent approximately 2 percent of Abbott’s total revenues and net assets, and to date the financial impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has not been material to Abbott’s operations or financial condition. Future implications are difficult to predict, but at present Abbott does not anticipate that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. A more detailed discussion of the risks associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect Abbott.\nOperating Earnings\nGross profit margins were\n50.3 percent\nof net sa\nles in 2023, 51.5 percent of net sales in 2022,\nand\n52.2 percent\nof net sales in 2021. The decrease in 2023 reflects the unfavorable effects of lower sales of COVID-19 tests, foreign exchange, and higher costs for various manufacturing inputs, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of the negative impact in 2022 of the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional business and the impact in 2023 of gross margin improvement initiatives. In 2022, the decrease reflected the impact of the voluntary infant product recall and Sturgis manufacturing stoppage, as well as the prioritization of infant formula sales related to the WIC Program in the Nutritional business. The decrease also reflected higher manufacturing and supply chain costs across Abbott's businesses, including inflation, commodities and distribution expenses.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $2.7 billion in 2023, $2.9 billion in 2022, and $2.7 billion in 2021. The decrease in R&D expense in 2023 was primarily driven by lower restructuring charges, lower impairment charges related to in-process R&D assets acquired in previous business combinations, and other cost reductions. The increase in 2022 versus 2021 primarily reflected higher spending on various projects to advance products in development, as well as a charge related to the impairment of certain in-process R&D intangible assets, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $10.9 billion in\n2023,\n$11.2 billion\nin 2022 and $11.3 billion in 2021.\nThe 2023 decrease reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower restructuring charges in 2023 as well as the non-recurrence of 2022 expenses related to the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional segment. SG&A expenses were virtually unchanged in 2022 compared to 2021 as higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth was offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.\nRestructurings\nIn 2023, Abbott management approved plans to restructure various operations in order to reduce costs in its medical devices, diagnostic, and established pharmaceutical businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $144 million of which approximately $56 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $22 million was recorded in Research and development and approximately $66 million  was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, Abbott recognized fixed asset impairment and inventory related charges of approximately $31 million related to these restructuring plans.\nIn 2022, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its medical devices, nutritional, diagnostic, and established pharmaceutical businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $234 million of which approximately $59 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $36 million was recorded in Research and development and approximately $139 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, Abbott recognized inventory related charges of approximately $23 million and fixed assets impairment charges of approximately $4 million related to these restructuring plans.\nIn 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter of 2021 in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries,\n31\nthe accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. Charges under this plan were recorded in Cost of products sold and totaled $441 million in 2021.\nIn 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its diagnostic, established pharmaceutical, nutritional, and medical device businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $68 million of which approximately $16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $4 million was recorded in Research and development and approximately $48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nInterest Expense and Interest (Income)\nInterest expense, net decreased from $375 million in 2022 to $252 million in\n2023.\nThe decrease was due to the favorable impact of higher interest rates on interest income, partially offset by the negative impact of interest rate hedge contracts related to certain fixed-rate debt. Interest expense, net decreased $115 million in 2022 due t\no the impact of higher interest rates and cash and short-term investment balances on interest income and the repayment of debt in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by the impact of interest rate hedge contracts related to certain fixed-rate debt.\nOther (Income) Expense, net\nOther income, net  increased  from $277 million of income in 2021 and $321 million\nof income in 2022 to $479 million of income in 2023. Other income, net includes income of approximat\nely $498 million, $406 million, and $270 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other income, net also includes\nequity investment impairments that totaled approximately\n$39 million\nin\n2023\nand\n$45 million\nin\n2022; in 2023 income from a $42 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration related to previous business acquisitions;\nand\na gain on the s\nale of an equity method investment in 2021.\nTaxes on Earnings\nTaxes on earnings include approximately $22 million, $43 million and $145 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, taxes on earnings in 2023, 2022 and 2021 also include approximately $80 million and $20 million of net tax expense and $55 million of net tax benefits, respectively.\nExclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malta and Malaysia. Abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules, tax rulings, grants, and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions.\nThe 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) includes a one-time transition tax that is based on Abbott’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining balance of Abbott’s transition tax obligation related to the TCJA is approximately $598 million, which will be paid over the next three years as allowed by the TCJA. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable.\nIn the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. In September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2019 Federal tax year in the amount of $417 million. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD relate to the reallocation of income between Abbott’s U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December of 2023.\nAbbott’s 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years are also currently under examination by the IRS with respect to income reallocation issues similar to those included in the 2019 Federal tax year. Abbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the IRS, the IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary.\nAbbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate.\n32\nThere are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which Abbott expects to be individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate taxing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Abbott is continuing to analyze the Pillar 1 proposal. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15 percent minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar 2 model rules with a subset of the rules becoming effective January 1, 2024, and the remaining rules becoming effective January 1, 2025, or in later periods. Abbott is also continuing to analyze the Pillar 2 model rules. Implementation of the OECD proposal may have a material impact on Abbott’s Consolidated Financial Statements in the future.\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate.\nResearch and Development Programs\nAbbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development.\nResearch and Development Process\nIn the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment’s existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity.\nDepending upon the product, the phases of development may include:\n•\nDrug product development.\n•\nPhase I bioequivalence studies to compare a future Established Pharmaceutical’s brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).\n•\nPhase II studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients.\n•\nPhase III studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use.\n•\nPhase IV and other post-marketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications.\nThe specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to six or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries, such as China.\nIn the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:\n•\nDiscovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area, platform, or unmet clinical need.\n•\nConcept/Feasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated, testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility.\n•\nDevelopment during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses.\nThe regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. In the U.S., the FDA classifies diagnostic products into classes (I, II, or III) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. While the Diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as Class I or Class II. Submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for Class I products. Class II products typically require pre-market notification to the FDA through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. Most Class III products are subject to the FDA’s Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. Other Class III products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a Biological License Application (BLA).\n33\nIn the European Union (EU), diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which had been governed by the European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive, depends upon the category, with certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company, known as a Notified Body, before the manufacturer can affix a CE mark to the product to declare conformity to the Directive. Other products only require a self-certification process. In 2017, the EU adopted the new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) which replaced the existing directive in the EU for in vitro diagnostic products and imposed additional premarket and post-market regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. In December 2021, the IVDR was amended to extend the regulation’s previous two-year transition period by a range of one to three years, with the transition period extending to May 2027 for certain classes of diagnostic devices. However, the amendment did not delay the date of application of the IVDR itself which took effect on May 26, 2022.\nIn the Medical Devices segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product’s safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.\nSimilar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the U.S., medical devices are classified as Class I, II, or III. Most of Abbott’s medical device products are classified as Class II devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or Class III devices that are subject to the PMA process.\nIn the EU, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which had been governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) which replaced the existing directives in the EU for medical devices and imposes additional premarket and post-market regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. The MDR applies to manufacturers as of May 26, 2021 with extended transition periods lasting as long as December 31, 2028 depending on the risk classification of the device in the regulation. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the MDR.\nSome products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self-certify its ability to apply the CE mark to the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions.\nAfter approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority.\nIn the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product’s efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.\nIn the U.S., the FDA requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA’s confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products.\nAreas of Focus\nIn 2024 and beyond, Abbott expects to focus on the following areas:\nEstablished Pharmaceuticals — Abbott focuses on building country-specific portfolios made up of high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas and biosimilars with the aim of addressing the health needs of more people in emerging markets and being among the first to launch new off-patent and differentiated medicines. In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as Creon™, Duphaston™, Femoston™ and Influvac™. Depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications.\n34\nMedical Devices — Abbott’s research and development programs focus on:\n•\nCardiac Rhythm Management – Development of next-generation rhythm management technologies, including advanced communication capabilities and leadless pacing therapies.\n•\nHeart Failure – Continued enhancements to Abbott’s mechanical circulatory support and pulmonary artery pressure systems, including enhanced clinical performance and usability.\n•\nElectrophysiology – Development of next-generation technologies in the areas of ablation, diagnostic, mapping, and visualization and recording.\n•\nVascular – Development of next-generation technologies for use in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures.\n•\nStructural Heart – Development of transcatheter and surgical devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves, and occlusion therapies for congenital heart defects and stroke-risk reduction.\n•\nNeuromodulation – Development of clinical evidence and next-generation technologies leveraging digital health to support improved patient clinical outcomes, physician engagement, and expanded indications in the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders and other indications.\n•\nDiabetes Care – Develop enhancements and additional indications for the FreeStyle Libre platform of continuous glucose monitoring products to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes and for use beyond diabetes.\nNutritionals — Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastrointestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.\nCore Laboratory Diagnostics — Abbott continues to commercialize its next-generation blood and plasma screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical needs, in various areas including infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, oncology, and neurologic assays as well as informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories.\nMolecular Diagnostics — Several new molecular in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests are in various stages of development and launch.\nRapid Diagnostics — Abbott’s research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology.\nIn addition, the Diagnostics segment is pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory process for various COVID-19 tests for which EUAs were obtained.\nGiven the diversity of Abbott’s business, its intention to remain a broad-based health care company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott’s total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott’s overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott’s 2023 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.\nWhile the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott’s ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is targeted at approximately 7 percent of total Abbott sales in 2024. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.\n35\nGoodwill\nAt December 31, 2023, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $23.7 billion. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs, using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. The results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value.\nFinancial Condition\nCash Flow\nNet cash from operating activities amounted to $7.3 billion, $9.6 billion, and $10.5 billion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The decrease in Net cash from operating activities in 2023 as compared to 2022 is primarily due to the decline in operating earnings and increased payments related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by lower expenditures for inventory and lower cash payments for income taxes due to lower earnings. The decrease in Net cash from operating activities in 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to the unfavorable cash flow impact of an increased investment in working capital, partially offset by reduced expenditures related to restructuring actions and lower cash payments for income taxes.\nA substantial portion of Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023, is held by Abbott affiliates outside of the U.S. If these funds were needed for operations in the U.S., Abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds.\nAbbott funded $349 million in 2023, $413 million in 2022, and $418 million in 2021 to defined benefit pension plans. Abbott expects pension funding of approximately $350 million in 2024 for its pension plans. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott’s capital expenditures and cash dividends.\nDebt and Capital\nAt December 31, 2023, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by S&P Global Ratings and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating.\nAbbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit as of December 31, 2023 were a part of a Five Year Credit Agreement that Abbott entered into on November 12, 2020. On January 29, 2024, Abbott terminated the 2020 Agreement and entered into a new Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement). There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2020 Agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on January 29, 2029 and will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Abbott's total debt outstanding was $14.7 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion will mature in 2024. Abbott expects to repay the $655 million of notes maturing in 2024 through the use of cash on hand and to refinance the $419 million term loan in 2024.\nOn November 30, 2023, Abbott repaid the $1.05 billion outstanding principal amount of its 3.40% Notes upon maturity. On September 27, 2023, Abbott repaid the €1.14 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.875% Notes upon maturity. The euro debt repayment equated to approximately $1.2 billion. In September 2023, Abbott repaid approximately $197 million of debt assumed as part of a recent business acquisition. On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55% Notes upon maturity.\nIn 2021, Abbott repaid approximately $195 million on a short-term facility upon maturity. After the repayment, Abbott has no short-term debt.\nIn October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. This authorization was in addition to the unused portion of a previous share repurchase program that was authorized in 2014. In 2021, Abbott repurchased 16.6 million of its common shares for $2.016 billion, which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the 2014 share repurchase program and a portion of the 2019 authorization. In December 2021, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. This authorization was in addition to the $1.081 billion portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2019 that was unused as of December 31, 2021. In 2022, Abbott repurchased 32.3 million of its common shares for $3.65 billion which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the 2019 share repurchase program and a portion of the 2021\n36\nauthorization. In 2023, Abbott repurchased approximately 9.8 million of its common shares for $1.025 billion. As of December 31, 2023, $1.41 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2021 repurchase program.\nAbbott declared dividends of $2.08 per share in 2023 compared to $1.92 per share in 2022, an increase of 8.3 percent. Dividends paid were $3.556 billion in 2023 compared to $3.309 billion in 2022. The year-over-year change in dividends paid reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital was $8.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The decrease was due largely to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by the repayment of debt due in 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $9.9 billion at December 31, 2022 to $6.9 billion at December 31, 2023 primarily reflects the payment of dividends, the repayment of debt, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and the cost of business acquisitions, partially offset by the cash generated from operations.\nAbbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures of $2.2 billion in 2023, $1.8 billion in 2022, and $1.9 billion in 2021 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers.\nContractual Obligations\nAbbott believes that its available cash and cash equivalents along with its ability to generate operating cash flow and continued access to debt markets are sufficient to fund existing and planned cash requirements. Abbott's material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\nDebt\n— Principal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2023 are $1.1 billion in 2024, $1.5 billion in 2025, $3.0 billion in 2026, $656 million in 2027, $651 million in 2028 and $8.0 billion in 2029 and thereafter. Interest payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2023 are projected to be $526 million in 2024, $508 million in 2025, $474 million in 2026, $391 million in 2027, $385 million in 2028 and $5.0 billion in 2029 and thereafter.\nOperating leases\n— As of December 31, 2023, estimated contractual obligations for operating lease payments were $1.362 billion, with $278 million due within 12 months.\nIn addition, Abbott enters into purchase commitments in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. The majority of outstanding purchase commitments generally do not extend past one year.\nContingent Obligations\nAbbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nOn September 22, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Bigfoot, which will further Abbott's efforts to develop connected solutions for making diabetes management more personal and precise. The purchase price, the preliminary allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Bigfoot since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\nOn April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of CSI for $20 per common share, which equated to a purchase price of\n$851 million. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and accounted for as a business combination. CSI's atherectomy system, which is used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease, adds complementary technologies to Abbott's portfolio of vascular device offerings.\n37\nThe preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the CSI acquisition resulted in the recording of two non-deductible developed technology intangible assets of $305 million; non-deductible in-process research and development of $15 million, which will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation; non-deductible goodwill of $371 million; net deferred tax assets of approximately $46 million and other net assets of approximately $114 million. The goodwill is identifiable to the Medical Devices reportable segment and is attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation of assets and liabilities is completed. Revenues and earnings of CSI included in Abbott's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date are not material to Abbott's consolidated revenue and earnings. If the acquisition of CSI had taken place as of the beginning of 2022, consolidated net sales and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.\nIn September 2021, Abbott acquired Walk Vascular, LLC (Walk Vascular), a commercial-stage medical device company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system designed to remove peripheral blood clots. Walk Vascular’s peripheral thrombectomy system has been incorporated into Abbott’s existing endovascular portfolio. The purchase price, the allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Walk Vascular since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott’s consolidated financial statements.\nLegislative Issues\nAbbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires an entity to report information about its supplier finance program. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's  consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n, which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n, which expands the breadth and frequency of required segment disclosures. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2024 reporting and for interim periods beginning in the first quarter of 2025. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, which requires an entity to disclose annually additional information related to the company's income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid during the period. The guidance should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2025 reporting. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nUnder the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\n38"

    "text": "Financial Instruments and Risk Management\nMarket Price Sensitive Investments\nThe fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $12 million and $9 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2023 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $314 million and $298 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.\nNon-Publicly Traded Equity Securities\nAbbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $88 million and $83 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $20 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nInterest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts with notional values totaling $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $14.8 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.6% and 3.5% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values.\nForeign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, Abbott held $7.3 billion and $7.7 billion of notional values, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2023 will mature in 2024 or 2025 depending on the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2022 matured in 2023 or will mature in 2024 depending upon the contract.\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, Abbott held $13.8 billion and $12.0 billion of notional values, respectively, of such contracts, which mature within 13 months.\nAbbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $419 million and $446 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\n39\nThe following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n40"

Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales rebates, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefits, valuation of intangible assets, litigation, derivative financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION — The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer’s normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain Abbott businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation.\nINCOME TAXES — Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GILTI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE — Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities.\nNet earnings allocated to common shares in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $\n5.701\nbillion, $\n6.905\nbillion and $\n7.042\nbillion, respectively.\nPENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS — Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a\nfive-year\nperiod. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method.\n48\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS — For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION — The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized over their requisite service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense.\nLITIGATION — Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred.\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS — Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities, money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of $\n141\nmillion that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\nTRADE RECEIVABLE VALUATIONS — Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.\nINVENTORIES — Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost includes material and conversion costs.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT — Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nThe following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment:\nPRODUCT LIABILITY — Abbott accrues for product liability claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The liabilities are adjusted quarterly as additional information becomes available. Product liability losses are self-insured.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS — Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.\n49\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) — The initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.\nCONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES — Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. Product warranties are not significant.\nAbbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events.\nNote 2 —\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires an entity to report information about its supplier finance program. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n, which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n, which expands the breadth and frequency of required segment disclosures. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2024 reporting and for interim periods beginning in the first quarter of 2025. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, which requires an entity to disclose annually additional information related to the company's income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid during the period. The guidance should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2025 reporting. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3 —\nRevenue\nAbbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has\nfour\nreportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.\n50\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 3 — Revenue (Continued)\nThe following tables provide detail by sales category:\nNote: The Acelis Connected Health business was internally transferred from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure on January 1, 2023. As a result, $\n115\nmillion of sales in 2022 and $\n118\nmillion of sales in 2021 were moved from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure.\nProducts sold by the Diagnostics segment include various types of diagnostic tests to detect the COVID-19 coronavirus. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $\n1.6\nbillion in 2023, $\n8.4\nbillion in 2022 and $\n7.7\nbillion in 2021.\n51\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 3 — Revenue (Continued)\nAbbott recognizes revenue from product sales upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. For maintenance agreements that provide service beyond Abbott’s standard warranty and other service agreements, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. A time-based measure of progress appropriately reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Payment terms between Abbott and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant.\nManagement exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Abbott provides rebates to government agencies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other private entities.\nRebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from\none\nto\nsix months\nafter sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income.\nOther allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within\n15\nto\n30\ndays of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott’s historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant.\nAbbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott uses an expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2023, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $\n4.4\nbillion in the Diagnostic Products segment and approximately $\n478\nmillion in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately\n58\npercent of these remaining performance obligations over the next\n24\nmonths, approximately\n17\npercent over the subsequent\n12\nmonths and the remainder thereafter.\nThese performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above.\nAssets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nAbbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining or renewing contracts with customers are incremental to obtaining the contract. Abbott capitalizes these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from\ntwo\nto\nten years\n. The amounts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not significant.\n52\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 3 — Revenue (Continued)\nAdditionally, the cost of transmitters provided to customers that use Abbott’s remote monitoring service with respect to certain medical devices are capitalized as contract costs. Capitalized transmitter costs are amortized based on the timing of the transfer of services to which the assets relate, which typically ranges from\neight\nto\nten years\n. The amounts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not significant.\nOther Contract Assets and Liabilities\nAbbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant.\nContract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements.\nChanges in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows:\nNote 4 —\nSupplemental Financial Information\nOther (income) expense, net\n, for 2023, 2022 and 2021 include\ns approximately $\n498\nmillion, $\n406\nmillion and $\n270\nmillion of income, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs ass\nociated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans.\nThe following summarizes the activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts:\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances.\n53\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 4 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued)\nThe detail of various balance sheet components is as follows:\nThe increase in Abbott’s long-term investments as of December 31, 2023 versus the balance as of December 31, 2022 is primarily due to investments acquired as part of a business acquisition and other additional investments, partially offset by the impact of equity method investment losses.\nAbbott’s equity securities as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, include $\n314\nmillion and $\n298\nmillion, respectively, of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency.\nAbbott also holds certain investments as of December 31, 2023 with a carrying value of $\n141\nmillion that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of $\n88\nmillion that do not have a readily determinable fair va\nlue.\n________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________\n54\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 5 —\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe components of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows:\n________________________________________________________\nNote 6 —\nBusiness Acquisitions\nOn September 22, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. (Bigfoot), which will further Abbott's efforts to develop connected solutions for making diabetes management more personal and precise. The purchase price, the preliminary allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Bigfoot since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\nOn April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) for $\n20\nper common share, which equated to a purchase price of\n$\n851\nmillion. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and accounted for as a business combination. CSI's atherectomy system, which is used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease, adds complementary technologies to Abbott's portfolio of vascular device offerings.\nThe preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the CSI acquisition resulted in the recording of\ntwo\nnon-deductible developed technology intangible assets of $\n305\nmillion; non-deductible in-process research and development of $\n15\nmillion, which will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation; non-deductible goodwill of $\n371\nmillion; net deferred tax assets of approximately $\n46\nmillion and other net assets of approximately $\n114\nmillion. The goodwill is identifiable to the Medical Devices reportable segment and is attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation of assets and liabilities is completed. Revenues and earnings of CSI included in Abbott's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date are not material to Abbott's consolidated revenue and earnings. If the acquisition of CSI had taken place as of the beginning of 2022, consolidated net sales and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.\n55\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 6 — Business Acquisitions (Continued)\nIn September 2021, Abbott acquired Walk Vascular, LLC (Walk Vascular), a commercial-stage medical device company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system designed to remove peripheral blood clots. Walk Vascular’s peripheral thrombectomy system has been incorporated into Abbott’s existing endovascular portfolio. The purchase price, the allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Walk Vascular since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott’s consolidated financial statements.\nNote 7 —\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe total amount of goodwill reported was $\n23.7\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and $\n22.8\nbillion at December 31, 2022. In 2023, recent business acquisitions increased goodwill by approximately\n$\n576\nmillion. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased goodwill by $\n304\nmillion in 2023 and decreased goodwill b\ny $\n431\nmillion in 2022. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2023 was $\n2.7\nbillion for the Estab\nlished Pharmaceutical Products segment, $\n285\nmillion for the Nutritional Products segment, $\n3.6\nbillion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $\n17.1\nbillion for the Medical Devices segment. There were\nno\nreductions of goodwill relating to impairments in 2023 and 2022.\nThe gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $\n27.7\nbillion and $\n27.2\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets increased by $\n305\nmillion due to a recent business acquisition.\nAccumulated amortization was\n$\n19.7\nbillion\nand $\n17.6\nbillion as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased intangible assets by $\n44\nmillion in 2023 and decreased intangible assets by $\n150\nmillion in 2022. The estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2023 is approximately $\n1.9\nbillion in 2024, $\n1.7\nbillion in 2025, $\n1.6\nbillion in 2026, $\n1.3\nbillion in 2027 and $\n0.7\nbillion in 2028. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over\n2\nto\n20\nyears.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately  $\n787\nmillion and $\n807\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn 2023, $\n100\nmillion of impairment charges related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets in the Medical Devices reportable segment were recorded on the\nResearch and development\nline of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Recent business acquisitions increased IPR&D assets by $\n80\nmillion.\nIn 2022, $\n111\nmillion of impairment charges were recorded on the\nResearch and development\nline of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings related to certain IPR&D intangible assets associated with the Medical Devices business segment.\n56\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 8 —\nRestructuring Plans\nIn 2023, Abbott management approved plans to restructure various operations in order to reduce costs in its medical devices, diagnostic, and established pharmaceutical businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $\n144\nmillion of which approximately $\n56\nmillion was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $\n22\nmillion was recorded in Research and development and approximately $\n66\nmillion was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Payments related to these actions totaled $\n65\nmillion in 2023 and the remaining liability totaled $\n79\nmillion at December 31, 2023. In addition, Abbott recognized fixed asset impairment and inventory related charges of approximately $\n31\nmillion related to these restructuring plans.\nIn 2022, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its medical devices, nutritional, diagnostic, and established pharmaceutical businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $\n234\nmillion of which approximately $\n59\nmillion was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $\n36\nmillion was recorded in Research and development and approximately $\n139\nmillion was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, Abbott recognized inventory related charges of approximately $\n23\nmillion and fixed assets impairment charges of approximately $\n4\nmillion related to these restructuring plans.\nThe following summarizes the activity related to the 2022 restructuring actions and the status of the related accruals as of December 31, 2023:\nIn 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter of 2021 in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. Charges under this plan were recorded in Cost of products sold and totaled $\n441\nmillion in 2021.\nThe following summarizes the activity related to this restructuring action and the status of the related accruals as of December 31, 2023:\nIn 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its diagnostic, established pharmaceutical, nutritional, and medical device businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $\n68\nmillion of which approximately $\n16\nmillion was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $\n4\nmillion was recorded in Research and development and approximately $\n48\nmillion was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Restructuring activities under the 2021 plans have been completed and there are\nno\nremaining liabilities under these plans as of December 31, 2023.\n57\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 9 —\nIncentive Stock Program\nThe 2017 Incentive Stock Program authorizes the granting of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, foreign benefits and other share-based awards. Stock options and restricted stock awards and units comprise the majority of benefits that have been granted and are currently outstanding under this program and a prior program. In 2023, Abbott granted\n2,027,255\nstock options,\n474,369\nrestricted stock awards and\n4,981,231\nrestricted stock units under this program.\nUnder Abbott’s stock incentive programs, the purchase price of shares under option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the maximum term of an option is\n10\nyears. Options generally vest equally over\nthree years\n. Restricted stock awards generally vest over\nthree years\n, with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any\none year\nupon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target. Restricted stock units vest over\nthree years\nand upon vesting, the recipient receives\none\nshare of Abbott stock for each vested restricted stock unit. The aggregate fair market value of options and restricted stock awards and units is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which may be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant. Restricted stock awards and settlement of vested restricted stock units are issued out of treasury shares. Abbott generally issues new shares for exercises of stock options. As a policy, Abbott does not purchase its shares relating to its share-based programs.\nIn April 2017, Abbott’s shareholders authorized the 2017 Incentive Stock Program under which a maximum of\n170\nmillion shares were available for issuance. At December 31, 2023, approximately\n74\nmillion shares remained available for future issuance.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock awards and units activity for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe fair market value of restricted stock awards and units vested in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n536\nmillion, $\n639\nmillion and $\n809\nmillion, respectively.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n102\nmillion, $\n85\nmillion and $\n393\nmillion, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to all share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2023 amounted to approximately $\n450\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over the next\nthree years\n.\n58\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 9 — Incentive Stock Program (Continued)\nTotal non-cash stock compensation expense charged against income in 2023, 2022 and 2021 for share-based plans totaled approximately $\n644\nmillion, $\n685\nmillion and $\n640\nmillion, respectively, and the tax benefit recognized was approximately $\n144\nmillion, $\n170\nmillion and $\n267\nmillion, respectively. Stock compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory is not significant.\nThe table below summarizes the fair value of an option granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 and the assumptions included in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model used to estimate the fair value:\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the rates available at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an option is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Abbott’s stock and historical volatility of Abbott’s stock over the expected life of the option. Dividend yield is based on the option’s exercise price and annual dividend rate at the time of grant.\n59\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 10 —\nDebt and Lines of Credit\nThe following is a summary of long-term debt at December 31:\nOn November 30, 2023, Abbott repaid the $\n1.05\nbillion outstanding principal amount of its\n3.40\n% Notes upon maturity. On September 27, 2023, Abbott repaid the €\n1.14\nbillion outstanding principal amount of its\n0.875\n% Notes upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $\n1.2\nbillion. In September 2023, Abbott repaid approximately $\n197\nmillion of debt assumed as part of a recent business acquisition. On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $\n750\nmillion outstanding principal amount of its\n2.55\n% Notes upon maturity.\nIn December 2021, Abbott repaid a short-term facility for approximately $\n195\nmillion. After the repayment, Abbott has\nno\nshort-term borrowings.\nAbbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $\n5\nbillion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit as of December 31, 2023 were a part of a\nFive Year\nCredit Agreement that Abbott entered into on November 12, 2020. On January 29, 2024, Abbott terminated the 2020 Agreement and entered into a new\nFive Year\nCredit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement). There were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the 2020 Agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on January 29, 2029 and will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings.\n60\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 10 — Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued)\nPrincipal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2023 are $\n1.1\nbillion in 2024, $\n1.5\nbillion in 2025, $\n3.0\nbillion in 2026, $\n656\nmillion in 2027, $\n651\nmillion in 2028 and $\n8.0\nbillion in 2029 and thereafter.\nAt December 31, 2023, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by S&P Global Ratings and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating.\nNote 11 —\nLeases\nLeases where Abbott is the Lessee\nAbbott has entered into operating leases as the lessee for office space, manufacturing facilities, R&D laboratories, warehouses, vehicles and equipment. Finance leases are not significant. Abbott’s operating leases generally have remaining lease terms of\n1\nto\n10\nyears. Some leases include options to extend beyond the original lease term, generally up to\n10\nyears and some include options to terminate early. These options have been included in the determination of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nFor all of its asset classes, Abbott elected the practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC No. 842, “Leases” to account for each lease component (e.g., the right to use office space) and the associated non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) as a single lease component. Abbott also elected the short-term lease accounting policy for all asset classes; therefore, Abbott is not recognizing a lease liability or right of use (ROU) asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that Abbott is reasonably certain to exercise.\nAs Abbott’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments under each lease typically reflects Abbott’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date.\nThe following table provides information related to Abbott’s operating leases:\n________________________________________________________\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n61\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 11 — Leases (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and location of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities:\nLeases where Abbott is the Lessor\nCertain assets, primarily diagnostics instruments, are leased to customers under contractual arrangements that typically include an operating or sales-type lease as well as performance obligations for reagents and other consumables. Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g., reagent) sales. The allocation of revenue between the lease and non-lease components is based on standalone selling prices. Operating lease revenue represented less than\n3\npercent of Abbott’s total net sales in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nAssets related to operating leases are reported within Net property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $\n3.9\nbillion and $\n1.8\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $\n3.6\nbillion and $\n1.6\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\nNote 12 —\nFinancial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $\n7.3\nbillion at December 31, 2023, and $\n7.7\nbillion at December 31, 2022, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2023 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next\ntwelve\nto\neighteen months\n.\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, Abbott held gross notional amounts of $\n13.8\nbillion and $\n12.0\nbillion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.\nAbbott has designated a yen-denominated,\n5\n-year term loan of approximately $\n419\nmillion and $\n446\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and  December 31, 2022, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\nAbbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. Abbott had interest rate contracts totaling approximately $\n2.2\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and\n62\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 12 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued)\n$\n2.9\nbillion in 2022. The decrease from 2022 was due to the maturity of $\n700\nmillion of interest rate hedge contracts in 2023 in conjunction with long-term debt that also matured in 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of December 31:\nThe following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income.\nA loss of $\n44\nmillion and gains of $\n70\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion were recognized in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as hedges. These amounts are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line.\nThe interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The hedged debt is marked to market, offsetting the effect of marking the interest rate swaps to market.\nThe carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of December 31 are shown in the table below. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. The counterparties to\n63\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 12 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued)\nfinancial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. Abbott does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties.\nThe fair value of the debt was determined based on significant other observable inputs, including current interest rates.\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheet:\n64\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 12 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued)\nThe fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is determined using a market approach, which utilizes values for comparable derivative instruments. The fair value of the debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs.\nContingent consideration relates to businesses acquired by Abbott. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. The decrease in the amount of contingent consideration from December 31, 2022 reflects the impact of projected timeline changes for events that will trigger payment of contingent consideration, partially offset by additional contingent consideration assumed in a business acquisition in 2023. The maximum amount for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is based on a percent of certain sales. Excluding such contingent consideration, the maximum amount that may be due under the other contingent consideration arrangements was estimated at December 31, 2023 to be approxima\ntely $\n190\nmillion, w\nhich is dependent upon attaining certain sales thresholds or upon the occurrence of certain events, such as regulatory approvals.\nNote 13 —\nLitigation and Environmental Matters\nAbbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $\n4\nmillion, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $\n10\nmillion.\nAbbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $\n30\nmillion to $\n45\nmillion. The recorded accrual balance at December 31, 2023 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $\n40\nmillion. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\n65\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 —\nPost-Employment Benefits\nRetirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution and medical and dental plans.\nInformation for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows:\nThe $\n458\nmillion of defined benefit plan losses and $\n35\nmillion of medical and dental plan losses in 2023 that increased the projected benefit obligations primarily reflect the year-over-year decline in the discount rates used to measure the obligations. The $\n3.6\nbillion of defined benefit plan gains and $\n437\nmillion of medical and dental plan gains in 2022 that decreased the projected benefit obligations primarily reflect the year-over-year increase in the discount rates used to measure the obligations. The projected benefit obligations for non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $\n2.6\nbillion and $\n2.2\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligations for all defined benefit plans were $\n9.2\nbillion and $\n8.4\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor plans where the projected benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows:\n66\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)\nFor plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligations, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows:\nThe components of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows:\nIn addition, approximately $\n15\nmillion of income was recognized in 2023 related to the curtailment of a non-U.S. defined benefit plan.\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year includes the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service costs (credits) as noted in the previous table. Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year also includes: net actuarial gains of  $\n182\nmillion for defined benefit plans and a loss of $\n33\nmillion for medical and dental plans in 2023; net actuarial gains of $\n858\nmillion for defined benefit plans and a gain o\nf $\n374\nmillion for medical and dental plans in 2022\n, and net actuarial gains of $\n1.14\nbillion for defined benefit plans and a gain of $\n45\nmillion for medical and dental plans in 2021. The net actuarial gains in 2023 related to defined benefit plans are primarily due to the favorable impact of actual asset returns in excess of expected returns, partially offset by the year-over-year decrease in discount rates. The net actuarial losses in 2023 related to medical and dental plans are primarily due to the year-over-year decrease in discount rates. The net actuarial gains in 2022 were primarily due to the year-over-year increase in discount rates, partially offset by the impact of 2022 actual asset returns being less than expected returns.\nThe net actuarial gains in 2021 are primarily due to the favorable impact of actual 2021 asset returns in excess of expected returns and the year-over-year increase in discount rates.\nThe weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows:\nThe weighted average assumptions used to determine the net cost for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows:\n67\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)\nThe assumed health care cost trend rates for medical and dental plans at December 31 were as follows:\nThe discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are forward projections of health care costs as of the measurement date.\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure the defined benefit and medical and dental plan assets at fair value:\n68\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)\n________________________________________________________\n(a)\nA mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various large cap indices.\n(b)\nA mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various mid and small cap indices.\n(c)\nA mix of index funds and actively managed pooled investment funds that are benchmarked to various non-U.S. equity indices in both developed and emerging markets.\n(d)\nA mix of index funds and actively managed accounts that are benchmarked to various U.S. government bond indices.\n(e)\nA mix of index funds and actively managed accounts that are benchmarked to various corporate bond indices.\n(f)\nPrimarily United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Eurozone government bonds.\n(g)\nPrimarily asset backed securities, bank loans, interest rate swap positions and diversified fixed income vehicles benchmarked to SOFR, Sterling Overnight Interbank Average (SONIA) or EURIBOR.\n(h)\nPrimarily hedge funds and funds invested by managers that have a global mandate with the flexibility to allocate capital broadly across a wide range of asset classes and strategies including, but not limited to equities, fixed income, commodities, interest rate futures, currencies and other securities to outperform an agreed upon benchmark with specific return and volatility targets.\n(i)\nPrimarily investments in private funds, such as private equity, private credit, private real estate and private energy funds.\n(j)\nInvestments measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet.\nEquities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds, investments may be redeemed once per week or month, with a required\n2\nto\n30\nday notice period. For the remaining funds, daily redemption of an investment is allowed. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did\nno\nt have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required\n2\nto\n60\nday notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily.\nAbsolute return funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. All private funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund on a one-quarter lag adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through the reporting date. Abbott did\nno\nt have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from\n45\nto\n90\ndays. For approximately $\n280\nmillion and $\n250\nmillion of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a\n33\npercent gate and a\n25\npercent gate, respectively, and $\n80\nmillion is subject to a lock u\nntil 2025. Investments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2024 to 2033. Abbott’s unfunded commitment in these funds was $\n555\nmillion and $\n569\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The plans do not directly hold any securities of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans’ assets. Abbott’s medical and dental plans’ assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company’s targeted asset allocation percentages.\n69\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)\nThe plans’ expected return on assets, as shown above, is based on management’s expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions.\nAbbott funds its domestic pension plans according to U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. Abbott funded $\n349\nmillion in 2023 and $\n413\nmillion in 2022 to defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $\n350\nmillion to its pension plans in 2024.\nTotal benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which includes payments funded from company assets, as well as paid from the plans, are as follows:\nThe Abbott Stock Retirement Plan is the principal defined contribution plan. Abbott’s contributions to this plan were $\n199\nmillion in 2023, $\n190\nmillion in 2022 and $\n181\nmillion in 2021.\nNote 15 —\nTaxes on Earnings\nTaxes on earnings reflect the annual effective rates, including charges for interest and penalties. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.\nTaxes on earnings include approximately $\n22\nmillion, $\n43\nmillion and $\n145\nmillion in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, taxes on earnings in 2023, 2022 and 2021 also include approximately $\n80\nmillion and $\n20\nmillion of net tax expense and $\n55\nmillion of net tax benefits, respectively.\nThe TCJA includes a one-time transition tax that is based on Abbott’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining balance of Abbott’s transition tax obligation related to the TCJA is approximately $\n598\nmillion, which will be paid over the next\nthree years\nas allowed by the TCJA. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable.\nIn the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. In September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the IRS for the 2019 Federal tax year in the amount of $\n417\nmillion. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD relate to the reallocation of income between Abbott’s U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December of 2023.\nAbbott’s 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years are also currently under examination by the IRS with respect to income reallocation issues similar to those included in the 2019 Federal tax year. Abbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the IRS, the IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary.\n70\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 15 — Taxes on Earnings (Continued)\nAbbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate.\nThere are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which Abbott expects to be individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate taxing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Abbott is continuing to analyze the Pillar 1 proposal. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15 percent minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar 2 model rules with a subset of the rules becoming effective January 1, 2024, and the remaining rules becoming effective January 1, 2025, or in later periods. Abbott is also continuing to analyze the Pillar 2 model rules. Implementation of the OECD proposal may have a material impact on Abbott’s Consolidated Financial Statements in the future.\nEarnings before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes on earnings, were as follows:\nDifferences between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate were as follows:\n71\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 15 — Taxes on Earnings (Continued)\nImpact of foreign operations is primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malta and Malaysia.\nThe tax effect of the differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nAbbott has incurred losses in a foreign jurisdiction where realization of the future economic benefit was, in previous reporting periods, considered so remote that the benefit was not recognized as a deferred tax asset. In 2023, Abbott concluded that the future economic benefit of the incurred losses is no longer remote and therefore, a deferred tax asset was recognized. Abbott also concluded that it is not more likely than not that the tax benefit associated with the deferred tax asset will be realized; therefore, an offsetting valuation allowance was recognized.\nThe following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled:\nAbbott’s unrecognized tax benefits table includes amounts related to tax positions for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognized because the recognition of the future benefit is not expected. In 2023, Abbott's unrecognized tax benefits increased by $\n1.3\nbillion to $\n3.32\nbillion, which includes $\n2.06\nbillion attributable to tax positions that, if recognized, would result in a deferred tax asset and a related valuation allowance.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is approximately $\n1.22\nbillion. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $\n70\nmillion and $\n1.48\nbillion, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters.\n72\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 16 —\nSegment and Geographic Area Information\nAbbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world.\nAbbott’s reportable segments are as follows:\nEstablished Pharmaceutical Products\n—International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products.\nNutritional Products\n—Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products.\nDiagnostic Products\n—Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites. For segment reporting purposes, the Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics businesses are aggregated and reported as the Diagnostic Products segment.\nMedical Devices\n—Worldwide sales of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care products. For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Vascular, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Medical Devices segment.\nAbbott’s underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets.\nThe following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements.\n________________________________________________________\n73\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 16 — Segment and Geographic Area Information (Continued)\n_______________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________\n74\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 16 — Segment and Geographic Area Information (Continued)\n________________________________________________________\nLong-lived assets on a geographic basis primarily include property and equipment. It excludes goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets, and financial instruments. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, long-lived assets totaled $\n16.2\nbillion and $\n14.2\nbillion, respectively, and in the United States such assets totaled $\n8.9\nbillion and $\n7.7\nbillion, respectively. Long-lived asset balances associated with other countries were not material on an individual country basis in either of the two years.\n75\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Abbott Laboratories is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Abbott’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nAbbott’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2023, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nAbbott’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 79.\nRobert B. Ford\nChairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nPhilip P. Boudreau\nSenior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nJohn A. McCoy, Jr.\nVice President, Finance and Controller\nFebruary 16, 2024\n76\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders’ investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n77\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 16, 2024\n78\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 16, 2024\n79"

Benefits under the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program (the “2009 Program”) include non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2009 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares).\nIf there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2009 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program (the “2017 Program”). If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2009 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2009 Program.\n81\nIn April 2017, the 2009 Program was replaced by the 2017 Program. No further awards will be granted under the 2009 Program.\n(ii)\nAbbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program\n. Benefits under the 2017 Program include non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2017 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares).\nIf there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2017 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program. If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2017 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program.\n(iii)\nAbbott Laboratories Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees\n. Eligible employees of participating non-U.S. affiliates of Abbott may participate in this plan. An eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions at the rate of 1% to 10% of eligible compensation (in multiples of one percent) subject to a limit of US $12,500 during any purchase cycle.\nPurchase cycles are generally six months long and usually begin on August 1 and February 1. On the last day of each purchase cycle, Abbott uses participant contributions to acquire Abbott common shares. The shares may be either authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares acquired on the open market. The purchase price is typically 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date or on the first day of that purchase cycle. As the number of shares subject to outstanding options is indeterminable, columns (a) and (b) of the above table do not include information on the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2023, an aggregate of 8,565,087 common shares were available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, including shares subject to purchase during the current purchase cycle.\nIn April 2017, the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees was amended and restated as the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees.\nFor additional information concerning the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program, the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program, and the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees, see the discussion in Note 9 entitled “Incentive Stock Program” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n(b)\nInformation Concerning Security Ownership\n.
