It is the Company's competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders. The ITW Business Model is comprised of three unique elements:\n•\nITW's\n80/20 Front-to-Back\nprocess is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company and its customers. Through the application of data driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the \"80\") and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the \"20\"). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;\n•\nCustomer-back Innovation\nhas fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company's unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 Front-to-Back process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their \"80\" customers. ITW's innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in \"80\" markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 19,600 granted and pending patents;\n4\n•\nITW's\nDecentralized, Entrepreneurial Culture\nenables ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. ITW colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the Company's strategy and values. As a result, the Company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each business' customers and end markets.\nENTERPRISE STRATEGY: 2012 - 2023\nIn late 2012, ITW began its strategic framework transitioning the Company to fully leverage the unique and powerful set of capabilities and operating practices of the ITW Business Model. The Company undertook a complete review of its performance, focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations. ITW determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders.\nKey initiatives in the Company's enterprise strategy included portfolio management, business structure simplification, strategic sourcing and the diligent re-application of ITW's proprietary 80/20 Front-to-Back process.\n•\nAs part of the Portfolio Management initiative, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions.\n•\nBusiness Structure Simplification was implemented to simplify and scale up ITW's operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 84 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.\n•\nThe Strategic Sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at ITW, delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year since 2013 and continues to be a key contributor to the Company's ongoing enterprise strategy.\n•\nWith the initial portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely completed, the Company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth, reapplying the 80/20 Front-to-Back process to optimize its scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.\nSince implementing the Company's enterprise strategy in 2012, the Company has demonstrated the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model and superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company's operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. At the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.\nOUR NEXT PHASE: 2024-2030\nIn the Next Phase of the Company’s evolution, the ITW Business Model and the Enterprise Strategy framework will be as formidable of a competitive advantage and performance differentiator as it has been over the last decade, if not more so. Volatility, risk and the pace of change in the global operating environment will continue to increase, and a decentralized entrepreneurial culture allows the Company to be a fast adaptor – to read, react, respond and evolve. The Company’s ability to consistently execute and invest through the ups and downs of the business cycle is now a defining competitive advantage.\nThroughout the Next Phase, the Company's focus is to build organic growth into a core ITW strength on par with the Company’s world-class financial performance and operational capabilities. Throughout this phase, the Company will sustain its foundational strengths built over the past decade, including the high-quality ITW Business Model practice. Customer-back Innovation (CBI) is the most impactful driver to achieve high-quality organic growth through the cycle by establishing trusted problem solver relationships with key customers to effectively invent solutions that address customers' most critical pain points or tackle the biggest growth opportunities. CBI successes, coupled with underlying market growth and share gains, are how the Company intends to achieve its high-quality organic growth\n.\n5\nPortfolio Discipline\nThe Company only operates in industries where it can generate significant, long-term competitive advantage from the ITW Business Model. ITW businesses have the right \"raw material\" in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the ITW Business Model and have significant potential to drive above-market organic growth over the long-term.\nThe Company focuses on high-quality businesses, ensuring it operates in markets with positive long-term macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value ITW's differentiated products, services and solutions. ITW's portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the Company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments.\nThe Company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent long-term performance. This includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement ITW's long-term growth potential.\nThe Company previously communicated its intent to explore options, including potential divestitures, for certain businesses with annual revenues totaling up to $1.0 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the divestitures of three businesses. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company chose to defer any significant divestiture activity in 2020 and 2021. The Company reinitiated the divestiture process in 2022 for certain businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately $0.5 billion, subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors. In the second quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest two businesses, including one business in the Polymers & Fluids segment and one business in the Food Equipment segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, both of these businesses were divested. The business in the Polymers & Fluids segment was sold for $220 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $156 million. The business in the Food Equipment segment was sold for $59 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $41 million. Operating revenue related to these divested businesses that was included in the Company's results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $106 million and $115 million, respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest one business in the Specialty Products segment. This business was presented as held for sale in the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2022 and had assets and liabilities held for sale of $8 million and $1 million, respectively. This business was sold on April 3, 2023, with no significant gain or loss upon sale. Operating revenue related to this business that was included in the Company's results of operations was $9 million, $37 million and $35 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 4. Divestitures in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding the Company's divestitures.\nAs the Company continues to make progress toward its full potential, the Company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the long-term organic growth potential of ITW through the addition of selective high-quality acquisitions, such as the acquisition of the Test & Simulation business of MTS Systems Corporation (\"MTS\") from Amphenol Corporation on December 1, 2021. The operating results of the MTS Test & Simulation business were reported within the Company's Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. Refer to Note 3. Acquisitions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding this acquisition.\n80/20 Front-to-Back Practice Excellence\nITW will continue to drive 80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence in every division in the Company, every day. Driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 80/20 Front-to-Back practice across the Company, division by division, will produce further customer-facing performance improvement in a number of divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level.\nCurrent Year Developments\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n6\nDistribution Methods\nThe Company's businesses primarily distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors.\nBacklog\nBacklog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Company's businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of their products.\nCompetition\nWith operations in 51 countries, the Company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are fragmented, and the Company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. The Company's competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. Each of the Company's segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition to numerous smaller regional competitors, the Welding segment competes globally with Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and ESAB Corporation.\nIn virtually all segments, the Company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation, product quality, brand preference and service delivery. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments. The Company believes that each segment's primary competitive advantages derive from the ITW Business Model and decentralized operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level, enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables the Company's businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the Company's 80/20 Front-to-Back process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities. The Company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets, especially in its Automotive OEM segment.\nRaw Materials\nThe Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily steel, resins and chemicals, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are currently anticipated.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company owns approximately 4,000 unexpired U.S. patents and 9,900 foreign patents covering articles, methods and machines. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,400 applications for patents pending in the U.S. Patent Office and 4,300 applications pending in foreign patent offices. There is no assurance that any of these patents will be issued. The Company maintains a patent group for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.\nThe Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important; however, the expiration of any one of the Company's patents would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position. The Company also credits its success in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.\nIn addition to patents, many of the Company's products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company in the aggregate. Some of the Company's more significant trademarks include ITW, which is also used in conjunction with the trademarks of many of the Company's businesses; Deltar and Shakeproof in the Automotive OEM segment; Hobart in the Food Equipment segment; Instron and MTS in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment; Miller in the Welding segment; Rain-X and Permatex in the Polymers & Fluids segment; Paslode in the Construction Products segment; and Hi-Cone in the Specialty Products segment.\nGovernment Regulations\nThe Company believes that its businesses and operations, including its manufacturing plants and equipment, are in substantial compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations, including those related to environmental, consumer protection, international trade, labor and employment, human rights, tax, anti-bribery and competition matters. Any additional\n7\nmeasures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company's capital expenditures (including expenditures for environmental control facilities), competitive position, financial position or results of operations.\nVarious legislative and administrative regulations applicable to the Company in the matters noted above have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Company's revenues, earnings or cash flows. However, if new or amended laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, the Company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company employed approximately 45,000 people, with approximately 17,000 people located in the United States and the remainder in multiple other countries where the Company's businesses operate. The Company strives to be a great employer through its demonstrated commitment to employee safety, its workplace culture, talent development, diversity and inclusion, compensation and benefits.\nEmployee Safety\n. The safety and well-being of ITW's colleagues around the world is its top priority, in addition to being an essential component of our commitment to be a great employer. Guided by the Company's Enterprise Safety Strategy and the philosophy that every accident is preventable, ITW strives every day to foster a proactive safety culture. ITW's Enterprise Safety Strategy and Safety Policy are based on the following core principles: (i) a goal of zero accidents; (ii) shared ownership for safety (business and individual); (iii) proactive approach focused on accident prevention; (iv) continuous improvement philosophy; and (v) compliance with applicable national, regional, and local health and safety laws and regulations.\nWorkplace Culture\n. The Company's culture is deeply rooted in its core values: Integrity, Respect, Trust, Shared Risk and Simplicity. ITW colleagues are empowered to think and act like business owners within the Company's decentralized, entrepreneurial culture. Our decentralized structure allows each division to operate with autonomy and enables our people to embrace the personal impact they can make.\nTalent Development\n. The Company strives for all colleagues to \"own\" their careers and feel valued for the work they do. ITW colleagues are encouraged to learn new skills and capabilities primarily through on-the-job experience, hands-on coaching and feedback, in addition to formal training.\nThe Great ITW Leader Framework defines leadership capabilities and attributes to help colleagues to reach their full potential as leaders. Great ITW Leaders are expected to be experts in the practice of the ITW Business Model, make great strategic choices, deliver great results, be great talent managers and provide strong leadership. Great ITW Leaders who have expertise in the ITW Business Model are the critical factor in translating the potential of the ITW Business Model into full performance. Because this expertise develops over time and through specific experiences, the Company focuses on developing and promoting its own talent to support the Company's sustained business success over the long term.\nDiversity and Inclusion\n. ITW believes it is at its best when it brings together unique perspectives, experiences, and ideas. Rooted in ITW's core values of Respect and Integrity, the Company is committed to equal employment opportunity, fair treatment and creating diverse and inclusive workplaces where all ITW colleagues can perform to their full potential. ITW is committed to attracting the best talent and enhancing the diversity of its global leadership teams. ITW drives progress through a comprehensive enterprise Diversity and Inclusion Framework, which focuses on; (i) leadership commitment and accountability; (ii) attracting and retaining global, diverse talent; (iii) creating inclusive workplaces; and (iv) striving to be a great employer.\nCompensation and Benefits\n. As a global employer, the Company is committed to providing market-competitive compensation and benefits that support physical, mental, and financial well-being to attract and retain great talent across its global divisions. Specific compensation and benefits vary worldwide and are based on regional practices. In the U.S., the Company focuses on providing a comprehensive, competitive benefits package that supports the health and wellness, educational endeavors, community involvement and financial stability of its colleagues.\nLabor Relations\n. Less than three percent of the Company's U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. Outside the U.S., employees in certain countries are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association. The Company considers its employee relations to be excellent.\n8\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe executive officers of the Company serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Set forth below is information regarding the principal occupations and employment and business experience over the past five years for each executive officer. Unless otherwise stated, employment is by the Company.\nExecutive Officers of the Company as of February 9, 2024 were as follows:\n(1)\nMr. Santi will remain Chairman through March 1, 2024, after which he will become Non-Executive Chairman and will no longer be an employee of the Company.\nAvailable Information\nCopies of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n9\nare available free of charge through the Company's website (\nwww.itw.com\n), as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing with or otherwise furnishing such information to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"the SEC\").

    "text": "The Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in the Company’s securities.\nEconomic Risks\nThe Company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. Downturns in the markets served by the Company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. Slower economic growth, financial market instability, supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), labor market challenges, rapid inflation, armed conflicts (such as Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine), government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the Company serves can adversely affect the Company's businesses by reducing demand for the Company's products and services, limiting financing available to the Company's customers, causing production delays, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, or increasing the risk that counterparties to the Company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations.\nRising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of the Company's customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for the Company's products and customers' ability to repay obligations to the Company. Rising interest rates could have an impact on the Company and its customers' cost of capital.\nThe global nature of the Company's operations subjects it to political, economic and social risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOver 50% of the Company's net sales are derived from customers outside the United States, and the Company currently operates in 51 countries. The risks inherent in the Company's global operations include:\n•\nfluctuation in currency exchange rates;\n•\nlimitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises;\n•\nprice controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings;\n•\nsupply chain disruptions, including transportation delays and disruptions;\n•\npolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions, including political unrest and armed conflicts;\n•\nacts of terrorism;\n•\nthe impact of widespread public health crises and pandemics;\n•\ngovernment embargoes, sanctions or foreign trade restrictions;\n•\nthe imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures;\n•\ngovernment actions impacting international trade agreements, including the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement;\n•\nimport and export controls;\n•\nsocial and labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\n•\nthe potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises;\n•\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n•\nmultiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;\n•\nlimitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and\n•\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\n10\nThe global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies. Further changes in U.S. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs) and retaliatory actions by U.S. trade partners, including sanctions against Russia and developments in U.S.-China trade relations, could result in a worsening of economic conditions. If the Company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nA significant fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company's operating income.\nAlthough the Company's financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in Europe. The Company's profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies, has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe benefits from the Company's enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted, or the Company may not meet its long-term financial performance targets.\nAs the Company continues to execute on its enterprise strategy initiatives, it remains focused on the core principles of portfolio discipline, 80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence, and organic growth. Product line and customer base simplification activities, which are core elements of the Company's 80/20 Front-to-Back process, continue to be applied by the Company's operating divisions and are active elements of the enterprise strategy. Although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the Company's overall organic revenue growth in the short term. Additionally, other core activities of the enterprise strategy related to portfolio discipline and organic growth, including customer-back innovation, may not have the desired impact on future operating results. If the Company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives, the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted, or the Company may not meet its long-term financial performance targets.\nThe timing and amount of the Company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.\nShare repurchases constitute a significant component of the Company's capital allocation strategy. The Company has historically funded its share repurchases with free cash flow and short-term borrowings. The amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause the Company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the Company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to the Company from time to time, regulatory developments relating to share repurchase programs, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of U.S. cash.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully introduce new products, its future growth may be adversely affected.\nThe Company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the Company's competitive position. If the Company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected.\nIf the Company is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property, its competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nProtecting the Company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. The Company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property rights by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Company's competitive position and results of operations.\n11\nThe Company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions, including the acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business in December 2021. A number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. Impairment charges could adversely affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized.\nRaw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results.\nThe supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and the Company has experienced upward pricing pressure on raw materials such as steel, resins and chemicals. Significant price increases could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and operating margins. In particular, inflation, changes in trade policies, the imposition of duties and tariffs, potential retaliatory countermeasures, public health crises and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which adversely impacted the price and availability of raw materials), threatened or actual military conflicts (such as Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine) and severe weather events could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials. The Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. Consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe Company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.\nThe performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or if there is a violation of data privacy laws, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the Company may suffer financial or reputational damage.\nThe Company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. These technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; computer viruses; employee error or malfeasance; and attacks by computer hackers, which have continued to increase on a global scale in both magnitude and frequency, taken on novel and unprecedented forms and become more difficult to detect. Minor security breaches have occurred from time to time and are expected to occur in the future. Although the cyber-attacks experienced to date have not had a material impact, future security breaches of our technology networks and systems or those of our vendors and third-party service providers could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could cause reputational and legal harm as we are subject to data privacy laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, in the various countries in which we operate. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, or if we violate data privacy laws, there could be a negative impact on operating results and/or the financial reporting process and the Company may suffer financial or reputational damage.\nIn addition, cybersecurity laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase costs of compliance and expose the Company to reputational damage or litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions.\n12\nStrategic Transaction Risks\nThe Company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns.\nThe Company has engaged in various acquisitions in the past, such as the acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business in December 2021, and could choose to acquire additional businesses in the future. Acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the Company's profitability and returns:\n•\nThe acquired business' inability to adapt to the ITW Business Model or otherwise perform in accordance with the Company's anticipated results or timetable, could cause it to under-perform relative to the Company's expectations and the price paid for it.\n•\nThe acquired business could cause the Company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term.\n•\nAcquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.\n•\nThe acquired business could place unanticipated demands on the Company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.\n•\nThe Company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the activities of the acquired business. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase the Company's expenses, adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations.\n•\nAs a result of acquisitions, the Company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. If the Company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets.\nDivestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nThe Company has had significant divestiture activity in the past in accordance with its portfolio management initiative, and it divested one business in the first quarter of 2023 as it continues portfolio refinements to maintain portfolio discipline. The Company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters, which could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nTax, Legal and Regulatory Risks\nUnfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.\nAdverse outcomes in legal proceedings or enforcement actions may adversely affect results.\nThe Company's businesses expose it to potential costs and adverse rulings associated with commercial, intellectual property, employment, toxic tort and other product liability claims and lawsuits. The Company's global operations also subject it to government investigations in numerous countries. We cannot predict the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits and we may incur costs, judgments or fines or enter into settlements that could adversely impact our businesses, reputation or future financial results. The Company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. In addition, the Company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. Even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims, judgments or settlements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.\n13\nUncertainty related to environmental regulation and industry standards, as well as physical risks of climate change, could impact the Company's results of operations and financial position.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental risks. These regulations or standards could mandate even more restrictive requirements, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions and production of single use plastics, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, or the Company's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, the Company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, trade sanctions, data privacy, environmental, human rights or other laws.\nThe Company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the Company's strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. The Company is subject to complex U.S., foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations, such as anti-bribery and anti-corruption, competition, export and import, trade sanctions, data privacy, environmental and human rights laws. Although the Company has implemented compliance programs which include internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training to deter prohibited practices, these measures may not be effective in preventing employees, agents or business partners from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any such improper actions could subject the Company to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the Company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These systems may be subject to cyber-based attacks or breaches. For additional information related to the risks associated with cybersecurity threats, refer to the Business and Operational Risks section of Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCybersecurity risk management is part of the Company's global enterprise risk management program. In order to manage the risks associated with cybersecurity threats, the Company has implemented a robust risk-based cybersecurity program consisting of processes, technologies, and controls to assess, identify and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats.\nA key part of the Company’s cybersecurity program is the ITW Cybersecurity Framework, which is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework (\"CSF\") and is designed to protect the Company’s data through rapid identification of and effective response to cybersecurity incidents. The Company’s framework includes detailed processes and controls related to backup and recovery, response planning, awareness, vulnerability management and endpoint protection as well as cybersecurity requirements for third-party service providers. The framework is regularly reviewed, assessed, and updated based on input from third party specialists, threat intelligence firms and CSF standard updates.\nThe ITW Cybersecurity Framework includes a number of activities designed to enhance the Company's resiliency related to cyber-related risks and ensure that the Company's information systems are secure from material cybersecurity threats. These activities include the following, among others:\n•\nAnnual cybersecurity training;\n•\nQuarterly phish simulation testing;\n•\nOngoing response planning and tabletop exercises;\n•\nNetwork and endpoint monitoring;\n•\nVulnerability management and testing; and\n•\nBackup and recovery testing.\nWhile the Company's information systems are exposed to cybersecurity threats and risks, the Company has not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents during 2023, 2022 or 2021, and any costs or operational impacts related to cybersecurity incidents were immaterial during this period.\nGovernance\nITW's Board of Directors is responsible for providing oversight and strategic guidance to management to support the long-term interests of the Company's stakeholders. As part of this responsibility, the Board of Directors annually reviews and evaluates the Company's cybersecurity policies and practices with respect to risk management as well as steps taken by management to monitor and control such exposures.\nIn addition to oversight by the Board of Directors, several cross-functional management teams focus on cybersecurity risk and report any identified cybersecurity incidents. Each of the Company's divisions has a Division Cyber Incident Response Team and protocols in place to communicate cybersecurity incidents to a central Cyber Incident Response Team. The Cyber Incident Response Team is led by the Chief Information Security Officer and is responsible for the initial assessment of cybersecurity incidents and oversight of any incident response.\nOn a quarterly basis, or sooner if appropriate, cybersecurity incidents are summarized and reported to the Cybersecurity Governance Committee comprised of senior executives. Additionally, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\n15\nreceives quarterly cybersecurity reports from senior management which cover any identified cybersecurity incidents, results of third party vulnerability testing, and key developments in policies and practices during the quarter."

As of December 31, 2023, the Company operated approximately 410 plants and office facilities, excluding regional sales offices and warehouse facilities. Approximately 270 of the facilities were located outside of the United States. Principal foreign countries include China, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.\nThe Company's properties are well suited for the purposes for which they were designed and are maintained in good operating condition. Production capacity, in general, currently exceeds operating levels. Capacity levels are somewhat flexible based on the number of shifts operated and on the number of overtime hours worked. The Company adds production capacity from time to time as required by increased demand. Additions to capacity can be made within a reasonable period of time due to the nature of the Company's businesses."

    "text": "INTRODUCTION\nIllinois Tool Works Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"ITW\") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 84 divisions in 51 countries. As of December 31, 2023, the Company employed approximately 45,000 people.\nThe Company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products.\nDue to the large number of diverse businesses and the Company's decentralized operating structure, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.\nTHE ITW BUSINESS MODEL\nThe powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model is the Company's core source of value creation. It is the Company's competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders. The ITW Business Model is comprised of three unique elements:\n•\nITW's\n80/20 Front-to-Back\nprocess is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company and its customers. Through the application of data driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the \"80\") and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less\n18\nprofitable opportunities (the \"20\"). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;\n•\nCustomer-back Innovation\nhas fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company's unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 Front-to-Back process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their \"80\" customers. ITW's innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in \"80\" markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 19,600 granted and pending patents;\n•\nITW's\nDecentralized, Entrepreneurial Culture\nenables ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. ITW colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the Company's strategy and values. As a result, the Company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each business' customers and end markets.\nENTERPRISE STRATEGY: 2012 - 2023\nIn late 2012, ITW began its strategic framework transitioning the Company to fully leverage the unique and powerful set of capabilities and operating practices of the ITW Business Model. The Company undertook a complete review of its performance, focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations. ITW determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders.\nKey initiatives in the Company's enterprise strategy included portfolio management, business structure simplification, strategic sourcing and the diligent re-application of ITW's proprietary 80/20 Front-to-Back process.\n•\nAs part of the Portfolio Management initiative, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions.\n•\nBusiness Structure Simplification was implemented to simplify and scale up ITW's operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 84 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.\n•\nThe Strategic Sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at ITW, delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year since 2013 and continues to be a key contributor to the Company's ongoing enterprise strategy.\n•\nWith the initial portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely completed, the Company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth, reapplying the 80/20 Front-to-Back process to optimize its scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.\nSince implementing the Company's enterprise strategy in 2012, the Company has demonstrated the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model and superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company's operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. At the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.\nOUR NEXT PHASE: 2024-2030\nIn the Next Phase of the Company’s evolution, the ITW Business Model and the Enterprise Strategy framework will be as formidable of a competitive advantage and performance differentiator as it has been over the last decade, if not more so. Volatility, risk and the pace of change in the global operating environment will continue to increase, and a decentralized\n19\nentrepreneurial culture allows the Company to be a fast adaptor – to read, react, respond and evolve. The Company’s ability to consistently execute and invest through the ups and downs of the business cycle is now a defining competitive advantage.\nThroughout the Next Phase, the Company's focus is to build organic growth into a core ITW strength on par with the Company’s world-class financial performance and operational capabilities. Throughout this phase, the Company will sustain its foundational strengths built over the past decade, including the high-quality ITW Business Model practice. Customer-back Innovation (CBI) is the most impactful driver to achieve high-quality organic growth through the cycle by establishing trusted problem solver relationships with key customers to effectively invent solutions that address customers' most critical pain points or tackle the biggest growth opportunities. CBI successes, coupled with underlying market growth and share gains, are how the Company intends to achieve its high-quality organic growth\n.\nPortfolio Discipline\nThe Company only operates in industries where it can generate significant, long-term competitive advantage from the ITW Business Model. ITW businesses have the right \"raw material\" in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the ITW Business Model and have significant potential to drive above-market organic growth over the long-term.\nThe Company focuses on high-quality businesses, ensuring it operates in markets with positive long-term macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value ITW's differentiated products, services and solutions. ITW's portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the Company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments.\nThe Company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent long-term performance. This includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement ITW's long-term growth potential.\nThe Company previously communicated its intent to explore options, including potential divestitures, for certain businesses with annual revenues totaling up to $1.0 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the divestitures of three businesses. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company chose to defer any significant divestiture activity in 2020 and 2021. The Company reinitiated the divestiture process in 2022 for certain businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately $0.5 billion, subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors. In the second quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest two businesses, including one business in the Polymers & Fluids segment and one business in the Food Equipment segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, both of these businesses were divested. The business in the Polymers & Fluids segment was sold for $220 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $156 million. The business in the Food Equipment segment was sold for $59 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $41 million. Operating revenue related to these divested businesses that was included in the Company's results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $106 million and $115 million, respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest one business in the Specialty Products segment. This business was presented as held for sale in the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2022 and had assets and liabilities held for sale of $8 million and $1 million, respectively. This business was sold on April 3, 2023, with no significant gain or loss upon sale. Operating revenue related to this business that was included in the Company's results of operations was $9 million, $37 million and $35 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 4. Divestitures in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding the Company's divestitures.\nAs the Company continues to make progress toward its full potential, the Company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the long-term organic growth potential of ITW through the addition of selective high-quality acquisitions, such as the acquisition of the Test & Simulation business of MTS Systems Corporation (\"MTS\") from Amphenol Corporation on December 1, 2021. The operating results of the MTS Test & Simulation business were reported within the Company's Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. Refer to Note 3. Acquisitions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding this acquisition.\n20\n80/20 Front-to-Back Practice Excellence\nITW will continue to drive 80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence in every division in the Company, every day. Driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 80/20 Front-to-Back practice across the Company, division by division, will produce further customer-facing performance improvement in a number of divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level.\nTERMS USED BY ITW\nManagement uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the Company:\n•\nOrganic business\n- acquired businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months on a constant currency basis.\n•\nOperating leverage\n- the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period.\n•\nPrice/cost\n-\nrepresents the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers.\n•\nProduct line simplification (PLS)\n- focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. In the short-term, PLS may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. In the long-term, PLS is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns.\nUnless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nStarting in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to reduce its spread negatively impacted the global economy and caused significant disruptions in the Company's global operations as COVID-19 spread and impacted the countries in which the Company operates and the markets the Company serves.\nDespite the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company experienced solid recovery progress in many of its end markets during the past three years. However, new epidemics and pandemics (including any resurgence of COVID-19) could similarly adversely impact the operations of the Company and its customers and suppliers. A description of the risks relating to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company's business, operations and financial condition is contained in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business for a purchase price of $750 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. The MTS Test & Simulation business had operating revenue of $46 million for the one month ended December 31, 2021 and $422 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The Company expects the MTS Test & Simulation business to improve operating margin performance in later years through the application of the Company's 80/20 Front-to-Back process. The operating results of the MTS Test & Simulation business were reported within the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. Refer to Note 3. Acquisitions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the United States and several other countries imposed economic and other sanctions on Russia. The Company has four immaterial Russian subsidiaries with total assets of approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2023. The revenue for these four subsidiaries for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $26 million. These subsidiaries were not material to the Company's results of operations or financial position.\n21\nIn the second quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest two businesses, including one business in the Polymers & Fluids segment and one business in the Food Equipment segment. These two businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, both of these businesses were divested. On October 3, 2022, the business in the Polymers & Fluids segment was sold for $220 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $156 million. On December 1, 2022, the business in the Food Equipment segment was sold for $59 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $41 million. The pre-tax gains were included in Other income (expense) in the Statement of Income. Income taxes on the gains were mostly offset by the utilization of capital loss carryforwards of $32 million. Operating revenue related to these divested businesses that was included in the Company's results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $106 million and $115 million, respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest one business in the Specialty Products segment. This business was presented as held for sale in the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2022 and had assets and liabilities held for sale of $8 million and $1 million, respectively. This business was sold on April 3, 2023, with no significant gain or loss upon sale. Operating revenue related to this business that was included in the Company's results of operations was $9 million, $37 million and $35 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn a challenging and dynamic environment, the Company delivered strong financial results in 2023 primarily due to the continued successful execution of enterprise initiatives and continued focus on the highly differentiated ITW Business Model.\nOperating Revenue\nRefer to the \"Results of Operations for Total Company\" and the \"Results of Operations by Segment\" sections for discussion of changes in operating revenue for 2023 compared to 2022 and 2022 compared to 2021.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of revenue was $9.3 billion in 2023, $9.4 billion in 2022 and $8.5 billion in 2021. Cost of revenue was 1.2% lower in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the impact of divestiture activity in the second quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, which reduced cost of revenue by 1.0%.

Product line simplification activities reduced organic revenue by 150 basis points.\n◦\nNorth American organic revenue decreased 6.4% primarily driven by a decline in the consumer packaging, specialty films, strength films and decorating equipment businesses, partially offset by growth in the ground support equipment, appliance and filter medical businesses.\n◦\nInternational organic revenue declined 1.6% primarily due to a decrease in Asia Pacific in the strength films, graphics and decorating equipment businesses, partially offset by growth in the ground support equipment and consumer packaging businesses in Europe.\n•\nOperating margin of 26.5% decreased 20 basis points primarily driven by unfavorable operating leverage of 90 basis points, higher employee-related expenses and product mix, partially offset by favorable price/cost of 130 basis points, benefits from the Company's enterprise initiatives and the favorable impact of a divestiture in the second quarter of 2023.\n33\n2022 compared to 2021\n•\nOperating revenue declined due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher organic revenue.\n•\nOrganic revenue increased 0.4% as consumable sales increased 3.0% and equipment sales declined 9.5%. Product line simplification activities reduced organic revenue by 170 basis points.\n◦\nNorth American organic revenue increased 2.5% primarily due to growth in the foils and thermal films, consumer packaging, specialty films, filter medical and ground support businesses, partially offset by a decline in the appliance and strength films businesses.\n◦\nInternational organic revenue declined 3.2% primarily due to a decline in Asia Pacific of 22.8% primarily driven by decreases in the strength films, appliance, foils and thermal films, and graphics businesses. The results in 2022 were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and government stay-at-home orders in China. Europe organic revenue grew 2.8% primarily due to an increase in the consumer packaging, specialty films and filter medical businesses, partially offset by a decline in the appliance business.\n•\nOperating margin of 26.7% decreased 50 basis points primarily driven by higher operating expenses, including employee-related expenses, partially offset by benefits from the Company's enterprise initiatives and favorable price/cost of 10 basis points.\nOTHER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n•\nInterest expense was $266 million in 2023, $203 million in 2022 and $202 million in 2021. Interest expense in 2023 was higher than 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates, partially offset by the repayment of notes due May 22, 2023. Interest expense in 2022 was $1 million higher than 2021 primarily due to higher average outstanding commercial paper and higher interest rates, partially offset by the repayment of notes due September 15, 2021 and May 20, 2022. Refer to Note 11. Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding the repayment of notes.\n•\nOther income (expense) was income of $49 million in 2023, $255 million in 2022 and $51 million in 2021. Other income was higher in 2022 as compared to 2023 and 2021 primarily due to net pre-tax gains of $191 million related to the sale of businesses in 2022.\n•\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2023, 2022, and 2021 was 22.6%, 21.0% and 19.0%, respectively. The 2023 effective tax rate benefited from a discrete income tax benefit of $20 million in the second quarter of 2023 related to amended 2021 U.S. taxes. The 2022 effective tax rate benefited from discrete income tax benefits of $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and $51 million in the second quarter of 2022 related to a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the resolution of a U.S. tax audit. The 2021 effective tax rate benefited from discrete income tax benefits of $21 million in the third quarter of 2021 related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and $112 million in the second quarter of 2021 related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the U.K. Finance Bill 2021, which increased the U.K. income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. Additionally, the effective tax rates for 2023, 2022 and 2021 included discrete income tax benefits of $20 million, $12 million and $17 million, respectively, related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Refer to Note 7. Income Taxes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.\n•\nThe impact of the Euro and other foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar in 2023 versus 2022 decreased operating revenue and income before taxes by approximately $7 million and $15 million, respectively. The impact of the Euro and other foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar in 2022 versus 2021 decreased operating revenue and income before taxes by approximately $628 million and $157 million, respectively.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n34\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and short-term credit facilities. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.1 billion of cash and equivalents on hand and no outstanding borrowings under its $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. The Company also has maintained strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:\n•\ninternal investments to support organic growth and sustain core businesses;\n•\npayment of an attractive dividend to shareholders; and\n•\nexternal investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support the Company's organic growth focus, such as the acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business on December 1, 2021, and an active share repurchase program. Refer to Note 3. Acquisitions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding this acquisition.\nThe Company believes that, based on its operating revenue, operating margin, free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing, if necessary.\nThe Company has certain contractual obligations, primarily noncurrent income taxes payable, operating leases and long-term debt. Refer to Note 7. Income Taxes, Note 10. Leases and Note 11. Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for details related to the Company's contractual obligations. The Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet commitments as of December 31, 2023.\nCash Flow\nThe Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. Summarized cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nOperating cash flow improved in 2023 compared to 2022 as supply chains began to normalize in 2023 and the Company reduced its investment in working capital. Operating cash flow decreased in 2022 and 2021 primarily due to higher working capital investments to support revenue growth, including increased inventory levels to help mitigate supply chain risk and sustain customer service levels.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nOn August 3, 2018, the Company announced a stock repurchase program which provided for the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the \"2018 Program\"). Under the 2018 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 6.7 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $158.11 per share\n35\nduring 2019, approximately 4.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $167.69 per share during 2020, approximately 4.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $227.29 per share during 2021 and approximately 1.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $216.62 per share during 2022. The 2018 Program was completed in the first quarter of 2022.\nOn May 7, 2021, the Company announced a stock repurchase program which provided for the repurchase of up to an additional $3.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the \"2021 Program\"). Under the 2021 program, the Company repurchased approximately 7.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $210.46 per share during 2022 and approximately 6.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $235.35 per share during 2023. The 2021 Program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOn August 4, 2023, the Company announced a new stock repurchase program which provides for the repurchase of up to an additional $5.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the \"2023 Program\"). Under the 2023 program, the Company repurchased approximately 38,000 shares of its common stock at an average price of $263.44 per share during 2023. As of December 31, 2023, there were approximately $5.0 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2023 program.\n36\nAfter-tax Return on Average Invested Capital\nThe Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital (\"After-tax ROIC\") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. The Company defines After-tax ROIC as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the Company's operations. For comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the second quarter of 2023 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, for comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefits of $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $51 million in the second quarter of 2022 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022. Also, for comparability, the Company excluded the discrete tax benefits of $21 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $112 million in the second quarter of 2021 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. The most comparable GAAP measure to operating income after taxes is net income. Net income to average invested capital and After-tax ROIC for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were as follows:\n37\n(1)\nEffective tax rate used for interest expense and other (income) expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was 23.2%, 23.2% and 23.0%, respectively.\n(2)\nAverage invested capital is calculated using the total invested capital balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter within each of the periods presented.\nAfter-tax ROIC increased 130 basis points for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period as a result of a 6.6% increase in after-tax operating income versus a 2.0% increase in average invested capital.\nAfter-tax ROIC decreased 40 basis points for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period as a result of a 10.2% increase in average invested capital versus an 8.7% increase in after-tax operating income.\nA reconciliation of the 2023 effective tax rate excluding the second quarter 2023 discrete tax benefit of $20 million related to amended 2021 U.S. taxes is as follows:\nA reconciliation of the 2022 effective tax rate excluding the fourth quarter 2022 discrete tax benefit of $32 million related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and the second quarter 2022 discrete tax benefit of $51 million related to the resolution of a U.S. tax audit is as follows:\nA reconciliation of the 2021 effective tax rate excluding the third quarter 2021 discrete tax benefit of $21 million related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and the second quarter 2021 discrete tax benefit of $112 million related to a change in the U.K. income tax rate is as follows:\nRefer to Note 7. Income Taxes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding the discrete tax items noted above.\n38\nWorking Capital\nManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 is summarized as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023, a significant portion of the Company's cash and equivalents was held by international subsidiaries. Cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash and equivalents held internationally are typically used for international operating needs or reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses. International funds may also be used to fund international acquisitions or, if not considered permanently invested, may be repatriated to the U.S. The Company has accrued for foreign withholding taxes related to foreign held cash and equivalents that are not permanently invested.\nIn the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from operations to fund domestic cash needs and the Company's capital allocation priorities. This includes operating needs of the U.S. businesses, dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations, reinvesting to fund expansion of existing U.S. businesses and general corporate needs. The Company may also use its commercial paper program, which is supported by a long-term credit facility, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated by operations and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.\nDebt\nTotal debt as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023, short-term debt included $700 million related to the 3.50% notes due March 1, 2024, which were reclassified from Long-term debt to Short-term debt in the first quarter of 2023, $661 million related to the 0.25% Euro notes due December 5, 2024, which were reclassified from Long-term debt to Short-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2023, and commercial paper of $464 million. As of December 31, 2022, short-term debt included $535 million related to the 1.25% Euro notes due May 22, 2023, which were repaid on the due date, and commercial paper of $1.1 billion.\nOn May 5, 2023, the Company entered into a €1.3 billion Euro-denominated credit agreement (the \"Euro Credit Agreement\") with a termination date of May 3, 2024; provided, however, that the Company may extend the termination date by six months on up to two occasions. On May 12, 2023, the Company borrowed €1.3 billion of Euro term loans under the Euro Credit\n39\nAgreement. Proceeds from the borrowing were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding debt. Any loan under the Euro Credit Agreement may not be re-borrowed once repaid, in full or in part, and will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable EURIBOR (adjusted for any statutory reserves) plus 0.75% for the interest period selected by the Company of one, three or six months. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had €1.3 billion outstanding under the Euro Credit Agreement with an interest rate of 4.59%, which was included in Long-term debt as the Company intends to exercise its options to extend the termination date.\nThe Company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs, share repurchases, and small and medium-sized acquisitions. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility with a termination date of October 21, 2027, which is available to provide additional liquidity, including to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. No amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2023 or 2022. The maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2023 was $1.9 billion, while the average daily balance was $1.0 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had unused capacity of approximately $158 million under international debt facilities. In the ordinary course of business, the Company also had approximately $231 million outstanding in guarantees, letters of credit and other similar arrangements with financial institutions as of December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 11. Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional details regarding the Company's outstanding debt obligations.\nTotal Debt to EBITDA\nThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA as a measure of its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by net income before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis. Total debt to EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\n40\nStockholders' Equity\nThe changes to stockholders' equity during 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Company has three accounting estimates that it believes are most important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. Various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe Company's critical accounting estimates are as follows:\nIncome Taxes\n—\nThe Company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The Company's deferred and other tax balances are based on management's interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense, assets and liabilities recognized by the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the Company's various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n—\nThe Company's business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the Company's total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the Company could incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the difference. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $5.6 billion allocated to its reporting units. Although there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the Company's 80/20 Front-to-Back process. The amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately\n$215 million to $1.4 billion\n, with the average amount equal to\n$556 million\n. In all cases, the fair value of the individual reporting unit significantly exceeds its carrying value. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the Company's global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.\n41\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n—\nThe Company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. Pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. Pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant's years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. Future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Note 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the U.S. primary pension plan. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by approximately\n$24 million\n. The Company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weighted-average rate. See Note 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions.\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary pension plan, a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately\n$4 million\n."

    "text": "MARKET RISK\nThe Company is exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of its ongoing business operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. The Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of the Company's fixed rate debt. Refer to Note 11. Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for details related to the fair value of the Company's debt instruments. Additionally, rising interest rates would negatively impact the amount of interest expense related to new issuances of commercial paper and the outstanding Euro term loans borrowed under the Euro Credit Agreement.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Company operates in the U.S. and 50 foreign countries. The funding for the foreign manufacturing operations is provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital. The Company's products are typically manufactured and sold within the same country or economic union. Therefore, the Company's manufacturing operations generally do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.\nThe Company designated the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2014, the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2015, the €1.6 billion of Euro notes issued in June 2019 and the €1.3 billion of Euro term loans borrowed under the Euro Credit Agreement in May 2023 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). On February 22, 2022, €500 million of the Euro notes issued in May 2014 were redeemed in full and on May 22, 2023, €500 million of the Euro notes issued in May 2015 were repaid on the due date. Refer to Note 11. Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for additional information regarding the redemption of these notes. The amount of pre-tax gain (loss) related to these notes that was recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $(109) million, $205 million and $303 million, respectively.\n42"

    "text": "MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"ITW\") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). ITW's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nITW management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report included herein.\n43\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Illinois Tool Works Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Illinois Tool Works Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n44\nIncome Taxes — Refer to Note 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s income tax expense is recognized and measured based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions, which requires significant judgment. When calculating income tax expense management makes estimates and assumptions, including determination of the completeness of book income in each jurisdiction, calculation of taxable income through identification and classification of book to tax differences (either temporary or permanent items), consideration of applicable tax deductions or credits and the identification of uncertain tax positions.\nThe evaluation of each uncertain tax position requires management to apply specialized skill and knowledge related to the identified position. Management evaluates uncertain tax positions identified and a liability is established for unrecognized tax benefits when there is a more than 50% likelihood that its tax position will not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There is additional judgment to determine the amount of the liability for the underlying tax position.\nGiven the number of taxing jurisdictions and the complex and subjective nature of the associated tax regulations and rulings, certain audit matters required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists. These matters included the auditing of certain elements of income tax expense, identification of uncertain tax positions and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, and certain planning transactions with income tax expense implications.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nWith the assistance of our income tax specialists, our principal audit procedures related to the auditing of certain elements of income tax expense, identification of uncertain tax positions and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits and certain planning transactions with income tax expense implications included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over income tax expense, unrecognized tax benefits and certain planning transactions with income tax expense implications.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s significant estimates and judgments incorporated into the calculation of certain elements of income tax expense by:\n◦\nSelecting a sample of book to tax differences (temporary and permanent) and testing the accuracy, completeness, and classification of the selections, including evaluating that all impacts of significant transactions with income tax expense implications are considered.\n◦\nDeveloping an expectation over the foreign income tax expense by jurisdiction and comparing it to the recorded balance.\n◦\nTesting the accuracy of the relevant income tax expense calculations.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s significant judgments regarding the identification of uncertain tax positions by:\n◦\nEvaluating the reasonableness of a selection of certain planning transactions with income tax expense implications, including the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the transactions.\n◦\nAssessing management’s methods and assumptions used in identifying uncertain tax positions.\n◦\nComparing results of prior tax audits to ongoing and anticipated tax audits by tax authorities.\n◦\nEvaluating external information including applicable tax law, new interpretations, and related changes to assess the completeness and reasonableness of management’s considerations.\n◦\nDetermining if there was additional information not considered in management’s assessment.\n•\nWe evaluated a sample of the liabilities recorded for unrecognized tax benefits to assess the establishment and amount of the liability for the specific underlying tax position.\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 9, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\n45\nStatement of Income\nIllinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries\nThe Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n46\nStatement of Comprehensive Income\nIllinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries\nThe Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n47\nStatement of Financial Position\nIllinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries\nThe Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n48\nStatement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity\nIllinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries\nThe Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n49\nStatement of Cash Flows\nIllinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries\nThe Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n50\nNotes to Financial Statements\n(1)\nDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of business\n— Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"ITW\") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with approximately\n84\ndivisions in\n51\ncountries.\nThe Company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following\nseven\nsegments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products.\nConsolidation and translation\n— The financial statements include the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company follows the equity method of accounting for investments where the Company has a significant influence but not a controlling interest. Intercompany transactions are eliminated from the financial statements. Foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. Translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.\nReclassifications\n— Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year reporting.\nUse of estimates\n— The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAcquisitions\n— The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method, in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. The operating results of the acquired companies are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Refer to Note 3. Acquisitions for additional information regarding the Company's acquisitions.\nOperating revenue\n— Operating revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer and the customer obtains control of that good or receives the service performed. The Company's sales arrangements with customers are predominantly short-term in nature involving a single performance obligation related to the delivery of products and generally provide for transfer of control at the time of shipment. In limited circumstances, there may be significant obligations to the customer that are unfulfilled at the time of shipment, typically involving installation of equipment and customer acceptance. In these circumstances, operating revenue may be deferred until all significant obligations have been completed. In other limited arrangements, the Company may recognize revenue over time. This may include arrangements for service performed over time where operating revenue is recognized over time as the service is provided to the customer. It may also include the sale of highly specialized systems that include a high degree of customization and installation at the customer site which are recognized over time if the product does not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for work performed to date. Revenue for transactions meeting these criteria is recognized over time as work is performed based on the costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated costs at completion. The amount of operating revenue recorded reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services and may include adjustments for customer allowances and rebates. Customer allowances and rebates consist primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, which are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and anticipated trends. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in revenue and are recognized along with the related product revenue as they are considered a fulfillment cost. Sales commissions are expensed when incurred, which is generally at the time of revenue recognition. Contract liabilities associated with sales arrangements primarily relate to deferred revenue on equipment sales and prepaid service contracts.\nTotal deferred revenue and customer deposits were $\n395\nmillion and $\n427\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are short-term in nature. Refer to Note 5. Operating Revenue for additional information regarding the Company's operating revenue.\nResearch and development expenses\n— Research and development expenses are recorded as expense in the year incurred.\nThese costs were $\n284\nmillion, $\n269\nmillion and $\n239\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAdvertising expenses\n— Advertising expenses are recorded as expense in the year incurred.\nThese costs were $\n60\nmillion, $\n57\nmillion and $\n50\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n51\nIncome taxes\n— The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nCash and equivalents\n— Cash and equivalents include cash on hand and instruments having original maturities of three months or less. Cash and equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.\nTrade receivables\n— Trade receivables are net of allowances for doubtful accounts.\nThe changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nInventories\n— Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and include material, labor and factory overhead. The last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method is used to determine the cost of inventories at certain U.S. businesses. The first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method, which approximates current cost, is used for all other inventories.\nInventories priced at LIFO were approximately\n23\n% of total inventories as of December 31, 2023 and\n22\n% of total inventories as of December 31, 2022. If the FIFO method was used for all inventories, total inventories would have been approximately $\n117\nmillion and $\n111\nmillion higher than reported at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe major classes of inventory at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nNet plant and equipment\n— Net plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Renewals and improvements that increase the useful life of plant and equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.\nNet plant and equipment consisted of the following at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n52\nThe Company's U.S. businesses primarily compute depreciation on an accelerated basis. The majority of the Company's international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis.\nThe ranges of useful lives used to depreciate plant and equipment are as follows:\nDepreciation was $\n282\nmillion, $\n276\nmillion and $\n277\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGoodwill and intangible assets\n— Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. Amortizable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of\n3\nto\n20\nyears.\nThe Company performs an impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, or more frequently if triggering events occur, based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.\nWhen performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company evaluates the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value. The Company uses various Level 2 and Level 3 valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its reporting units, including discounting estimated future cash flows based on a cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit and market multiples of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the difference.\nThe Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets are determined based on a Level 3 valuation method using a relief-from-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference.\nRefer to Note 9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information regarding the Company's recorded goodwill and intangible assets.\nLeases\n— The Company recognizes a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for all operating leases with a noncancellable lease term of greater than one year. Rental expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the noncancellable lease term based on the minimum lease payments at lease inception. Changes in rent subsequent to commencement that were not included in minimum lease payments at inception are recognized as variable rent in the period incurred. Refer to Note 10. Leases for additional information regarding the Company's operating leases.\nAccrued warranties\n— The Company accrues for product warranties based on historical experience.\nThe changes in accrued warranties for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued authoritative guidance which improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. The new guidance provides an exception to measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with existing\n53\nrevenue recognition guidance rather than at fair value. The Company early adopted this new guidance in the fourth quarter of 2021. The new guidance is effective prospectively upon adoption and must also be applied retrospectively to all interim periods in the year of adoption. The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. Refer to Note 3. Acquisitions for additional information regarding the Company's acquisitions.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments. The more significant provisions include the requirement to disclose significant segment expenses and certain disclosures made annually under existing guidance will be required for interim periods. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning with its annual reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024 and is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have on its disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that expands the disclosure requirements for income taxes. The new guidance will require consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information presented in the effective tax rate reconciliation as well as disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning with its annual reporting for the year ended December 31, 2025 and is required to be applied prospectively, with retrospective application to prior periods allowed. The Company is currently assessing the impact the guidance will have on its disclosures.\n(2)\nNovel Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nIn early 2020, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") occurred in China and other jurisdictions. The COVID-19 outbreak was subsequently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. In response to the outbreak, governments around the globe took various actions to reduce its spread, including travel restrictions, shutdowns of businesses deemed nonessential, and stay-at-home or similar orders. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken globally to reduce its spread negatively impacted the global economy, causing significant disruptions in the Company's global operations starting primarily in the latter part of the first quarter of 2020 as COVID-19 spread and impacted the countries in which the Company operates and the markets the Company serves. Despite the ongoing disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company experienced solid recovery progress in many of its end markets during 2021 and, to a greater extent, in 2022 as vaccines became widely available and many governments reduced restrictions related to COVID-19.\n(3)\nAcquisitions\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the Test & Simulation business of MTS Systems Corporation (\"MTS\") from Amphenol Corporation (\"Amphenol\") for a purchase price of $\n750\nmillion, subject to certain closing adjustments. The MTS Test & Simulation business is a leading global supplier of high-performance testing and simulation systems and is highly complementary to the Company's existing Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. The operating results of the MTS Test & Simulation business were reported within the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment from the date of acquisition, with operating revenue of $\n46\nmillion for the one month ended December 31, 2021 and $\n422\nmillion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. During 2022, the Company completed the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date, including intangible assets and goodwill. Based on its final allocation, the Company recorded goodwill of $\n430\nmillion and intangible assets of $\n259\nmillion. The intangible assets included $\n93\nmillion related to indefinite-lived trademarks and brands and $\n166\nmillion related to amortizable intangible assets that are expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from\n1\nto\n14\nyears, with a weighted-average life of\n11\nyears. None of the goodwill related to this transaction is tax deductible. The fair values of the intangible assets were estimated based on discounted cash flow and market-based valuation models using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs and assumptions. This acquisition did not materially affect the Company's results of operations or financial position for any period presented.\n(4)\nDivestitures\nThe Company routinely reviews its portfolio of businesses relative to its business portfolio criteria and evaluates if further portfolio refinements may be needed. The Company previously communicated its intent to explore options, including potential divestitures, for certain businesses with annual revenues totaling up to $\n1\nbillion. As such, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as held for sale in periods prior to the sale of the business.\n54\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the divestitures of\nthree\nbusinesses. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company chose to defer any significant divestiture activity in 2020 and 2021. The Company reinitiated the divestiture process in 2022 for certain businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately $\n0.5\nbillion, subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest\ntwo\nbusinesses, including\none\nbusiness in the Polymers & Fluids segment and\none\nbusiness in the Food Equipment segment. These\ntwo\nbusinesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, both of these businesses were divested. On October 3, 2022, the business in the Polymers & Fluids segment was sold for $\n220\nmillion, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $\n156\nmillion. On December 1, 2022, the business in the Food Equipment segment was sold for $\n59\nmillion, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $\n41\nmillion. The pre-tax gains were included in Other income (expense) in the Statement of Income. Income taxes on the gains were mostly offset by the utilization of capital loss carryforwards of $\n32\nmillion. Operating revenue related to these divested businesses that was included in the Company's results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n106\nmillion and $\n115\nmillion, respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest\none\nbusiness in the Specialty Products segment. This business was presented as held for sale beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. Assets and liabilities held for sale related to this business were $\n8\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. This business was sold on April 3, 2023, with no significant gain or loss upon sale. Operating revenue related to this business that was included in the Company's results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n9\nmillion, $\n37\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion, respectively.\n(5)\nOperating Revenue\nThe Company's\n84\ndiversified operating divisions are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following\nseven\nsegments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products.\nOperating revenue by product category, which is consistent with the Company's segment presentation, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nThe following is a description of the product offerings, end markets and typical revenue transactions for each of the Company's\nseven\nsegments:\nAutomotive OEM\n—\nThis segment is a global, niche supplier to top tier OEMs, providing unique innovation to address pain points for sophisticated customers with complex problems.

Refer to Note 4. Divestitures for further information regarding the Company's divestitures.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company divested a\n51\n% majority interest in its former Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (\"CD&R\"). As a result of the transaction, the Company owns common units (the \"Common Units\") of Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (\"Wilsonart\") initially representing approximately\n49\n% (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity. CD&R owns cumulative convertible participating preferred units (the \"Preferred Units\") of Wilsonart representing approximately\n51\n% (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity. The Preferred Units rank senior to the Common Units as to dividends and liquidation preference, and accrue dividends at a rate of\n10\n% per annum. The ownership interest in Wilsonart is reported using the equity method of accounting. The Company's proportionate share in the income (loss) of Wilsonart is reported in Other income (expense) in the Statement of Income. As the Company's investment in Wilsonart is structured as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, U.S. taxes are recorded separately from the equity investment. In 2016, the Company received a $\n167\nmillion dividend distribution from Wilsonart which exceeded the Company's equity investment balance and resulted in a $\n54\nmillion pre-tax gain in 2016. As a result of the dividend distribution, the equity investment balance in Wilsonart was reduced to\nzero\nand any subsequent equity investment income will not be recognized until the gain is recaptured.\n(7)\nIncome Taxes\nNoncurrent income taxes payable\n— On December 22, 2017, the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (the \"Act\") was enacted in the United States. The provisions of the Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax rules. In connection with the enactment of the Act, the Company recorded a one-time additional income tax expense of $\n676\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to a one-time repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. A portion of the resulting income taxes payable can be paid in installments over eight years. The noncurrent income taxes payable related to the one-time repatriation tax was $\n151\nmillion and $\n273\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n58\nProvision for income taxes\n—\nThe components of the provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nIncome before taxes for domestic and foreign operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nThe reconciliation between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was\n22.6\n%,\n21.0\n% and\n19.0\n%, respectively. The 2023 effective tax rate benefited from a discrete income tax benefit of $\n20\nmillion in the second quarter of 2023 related to amended 2021 U.S. taxes. The 2022 effective tax rate benefited from discrete income tax benefits of $\n32\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and $\n51\nmillion in the second quarter of 2022 related to a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the resolution of a U.S. tax audit. The 2021 effective tax rate benefited from discrete income tax benefits of $\n21\nmillion in the third quarter of 2021 related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and $\n112\nmillion in the second quarter of 2021 related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the U.K. Finance Bill 2021, which increased the U.K. income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. Additionally, the effective tax rates for 2023, 2022 and 2021 included discrete income tax\n59\nbenefits of $\n20\nmillion, $\n12\nmillion and $\n17\nmillion, respectively, related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nUpon repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S., the Company may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. The accrual for foreign withholding taxes related to the expected repatriation of foreign held cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n39\nmillion and $\n50\nmillion, respectively.\nDeferred foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings considered permanently invested. As of December 31, 2023, undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested were approximately $\n6\nbillion. Determination of the related deferred tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities\n—\nThe components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nThe valuation allowances recorded as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 related primarily to certain net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had utilized all realizable foreign tax credit carryforwards.\n60\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which expire as follows:\nUnrecognized tax benefit\ns—\nThe changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nIncluded in the balance as of December 31, 2023 were approximately $\n295\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service, His Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately $\n8\nmillion related predominantly to the potential resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.\nThe following table summarizes the open tax years for the Company's major jurisdictions:\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The accrual for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n34\nmillion and $\n26\nmillion, respectively.\n(8)\nNet Income Per Share\nNet income per basic share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period. Net income per diluted share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares\n61\nassuming dilution for stock options and restricted stock units. Dilutive shares reflect the potential additional shares that would be outstanding if the dilutive stock options outstanding were exercised and the unvested restricted stock units vested during the period.\nThe computation of net income per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nOptions that were considered antidilutive were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share. There were\n0.3\nmillion,\n0.9\nmillion and\n0.4\nmillion antidilutive options outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(9)\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nIntangible assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n62\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business for a purchase price of $\n750\nmillion, subject to certain closing adjustments, which was reported within the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. During 2022, the Company completed the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date, including intangible assets and goodwill. Based on its final allocation, the Company recorded goodwill of $\n430\nmillion and intangible assets of $\n259\nmillion. Refer to Note 3. Acquisitions for additional information regarding this acquisition.\nThe Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2023, 2022 and 2021. There were\nno\nimpairment charges as a result of these assessments.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets for the twelve months ending December 31 was as follows:\n(10)\nLeases\nThe Company's lease transactions are primarily for the use of facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating lease arrangements. Total rental expense for operating leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n132\nmillion, $\n122\nmillion and $\n118\nmillion, respectively. Total rental expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 included $\n60\nmillion, $\n56\nmillion and $\n47\nmillion, respectively, related to short-term operating leases and variable lease payments. Short-term operating leases have original terms of one year or less, or can be terminated at the Company's option with a short notice period and without significant penalty, and are not capitalized.\nThe following table summarizes information related to the Company's capitalized operating leases for 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n63\nThe right-of-use assets related to operating leases and the current and long-term portions of operating lease liabilities were included in Other assets, Accrued expenses and Other liabilities, respectively, in the Statement of Financial Position. The weighted-average discount rate was based on the incremental borrowing rate of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2023, future maturities of operating lease liabilities for the twelve months ending December 31 were as follows:\n(11)\nDebt\nTotal debt as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nShort-term debt\n—\nShort-term debt represents obligations with a maturity date of one year or less and is stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Short-term debt also includes current maturities of long-term debt that have been reclassified to short-term, and excludes short-term debt classified as long-term because the Company has the intent and ability to extend the maturity date beyond one year.\nShort-term debt as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\nAs of December 31, 2023, current maturities of long-term debt included $\n700\nmillion related to the\n3.50\n% notes due March 1, 2024, which were reclassified from Long-term debt to Short-term debt in the first quarter of 2023 and $\n661\nmillion related to the\n0.25\n% Euro notes due December 5, 2024, which were reclassified from Long-term debt to Short-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2023.

During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a $\n3.0\nbillion,\nfive-year\nrevolving credit facility with a termination date of October 21, 2027, which is available to provide additional liquidity, including to support the potential issuances of commercial paper.\nNo\namounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2023 or 2022. The Company was also in compliance with the financial covenants of the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2023, which included a minimum interest coverage ratio. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper was\n5.40\n% and\n4.35\n% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n64\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had unused capacity of approximately $\n158\nmillion under international debt facilities.

The U.S. primary postretirement health care plan is contributory with the participants' contributions adjusted annually. The U.S. primary postretirement life insurance plan is noncontributory. Beginning January 1, 2007, the U.S. primary pension and other postretirement benefit plans were closed to new participants. Newly hired employees and employees from acquired businesses that are not participating in these plans are eligible for additional Company contributions under the existing U.S. primary defined contribution retirement plans. The Company's expense related to defined contribution plans was $\n117\nmillion in 2023, $\n111\nmillion in 2022, and $\n88\nmillion in 2021. In addition to the U.S. plans, the Company also has defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries, mainly the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and Switzerland.\n66\nSummarized information regarding net periodic benefit cost included in the Statement of Income related to the Company's significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented within Cost of revenue and Selling, administrative, and research and development expenses in the Statement of Income while the other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented within Other income (expense).\nThe Company used the most recently published mortality improvement scale from the Society of Actuaries, MP-2021, to measure its U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, which did not have a significant impact.\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the plan benefit obligations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the actuarial (gain) loss related to the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations was primarily related to changes in discount rates. Refer to the Assumptions section below for further details related to the discount rates used in the valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.\n67\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the plan assets and a reconciliation of funded status for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets had projected benefit obligations of $\n179\nmillion and $\n137\nmillion, respectively, and plan assets of $\n55\nmillion and $\n22\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets had accumulated benefit obligations of $\n175\nmillion and $\n131\nmillion, respectively, and plan assets of $\n55\nmillion and $\n22\nmillion, respectively.\n68\nAssumptions\n—\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the valuations of pension and other postretirement benefits were as follows:\nThe expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefit plans were developed using historical asset class returns while factoring in current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and asset class performance.\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. The Company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weighted-average rate.\nAssumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement health care benefit plans.\nThe assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31 were as follows:\nPlan assets\n— The Company's overall investment strategy for the assets in the pension funds is to achieve a balance between the goals of growing plan assets and keeping risk at a reasonable level over a long-term investment horizon. In order to reduce unnecessary risk, the pension funds are diversified across several asset classes, securities and investment managers. The target allocations for plan assets are\n15\n% to\n25\n% equity investments,\n75\n% to\n85\n% fixed income investments and\n0\n% to\n10\n% in other types of investments. The Company does not use derivatives for the purpose of speculation, leverage, circumventing investment guidelines or taking risks that are inconsistent with specified guidelines.\nThe assets in the Company's postretirement health care plan are primarily invested in life insurance policies. The Company's overall investment strategy for the assets in the postretirement health care fund is to invest in assets that provide a reasonable tax exempt rate of return while preserving capital.\nThe following tables present the fair value of the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 by asset category and valuation methodology. Level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. Level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets. Level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions market participants would be expected to use in pricing the assets. Each financial instrument's categorization is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n69\nCash and equivalents include cash on hand and instruments with original maturities of three months or less and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fixed income securities primarily consist of U.S. and foreign government bills, notes and bonds, corporate debt securities and investment contracts. The majority of the assets in this category are valued by evaluating bid prices provided by independent financial data services. For securities where market data is not readily available, unobservable market data is used to value the security.\nPension assets measured at net asset value include mutual funds, collective trust funds, partnerships/private equity interests and life insurance policies. Mutual funds and collective trust funds are funds that are valued based on the value of the underlying investments which can be redeemed on a daily basis. The underlying investments include both passively and actively managed U.S. and foreign large- and mid-cap equity funds and short-term investment funds. Partnerships/private equity interests are investments in partnerships where the benefit plan is a limited partner. The investments are valued by the investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use market, income and cost valuation methods. Distributions are received from these funds on a periodic basis through the liquidation of the underlying assets of the fund.\n70\nLife insurance policies are used to fund other postretirement benefits in order to obtain favorable tax treatment and are valued based on the cash surrender value of the underlying policies. The Company has selected the funds in which these assets are invested and may elect to withdraw funds with proper notice to the insurance company or maintain the policies and receive death benefits as determined by the contracts.\nCash flows\n— The Company generally funds its pension and other postretirement benefit plans as required by law or to the extent such contributions are tax deductible. The Company expects to contribute approximately $\n60\nmillion to its pension plans and $\n4\nmillion to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's portion of the future benefit payments that are expected to be paid during the twelve months ending December 31 is as follows:\n(13)\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including those involving environmental, product liability (including toxic tort) and general liability claims.\nThe Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated.\nSuch accruals are based on developments to date, the Company's estimates of the outcomes of these matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters. The Company believes resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, liquidity or future operations.\n(14)\nStockholders' Equity\nPreferred stock\n— Preferred stock, without par value, of which\n0.3\nmillion shares are authorized and unissued, is issuable in series. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix by resolution the designation and characteristics of each series of preferred stock. The Company has no present commitment to issue its preferred stock.\nShare repurchases\n— On August 3, 2018, the Company announced a stock repurchase program which provided for the repurchase of up to $\n3.0\nbillion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the \"2018 Program\"). Under the 2018 Program, the Company repurchased approximately\n6.7\nmillion shares of its common stock at an average price of $\n158.11\nper share during 2019, approximately\n4.2\nmillion shares of its common stock at an average price of $\n167.69\nper share during 2020, approximately\n4.4\nmillion shares of its common stock at an average price of $\n227.29\nper share during 2021 and approximately\n1.2\nmillion shares of its common stock at an average price of $\n216.62\nper share during 2022. The 2018 Program was completed in the first quarter of 2022.\nOn May 7, 2021, the Company announced a stock repurchase program which provided for the repurchase of up to an additional $\n3.0\nbillion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the \"2021 Program\"). Under the 2021 program, the Company repurchased approximately\n7.1\nmillion shares of its common stock at an average price of $\n210.46\nper share during 2022 and approximately\n6.3\nmillion shares of its common stock at an average price of $\n235.35\nper share during 2023. The 2021 Program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOn August 4, 2023, the Company announced a new stock repurchase program which provides for the repurchase of up to an additional $\n5.0\nbillion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the \"2023 Program\"). Under the 2023 program, the Company repurchased approximately\n38,000\nshares of its common stock at an average price of $\n263.44\nper share during 2023. As of December 31, 2023, there were approximately $\n5.0\nbillion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2023 program.\nCash Dividends\n— Cash dividends declared were $\n5.42\nper share in 2023, $\n5.06\nper share in 2022 and $\n4.72\nper share in 2021. Cash dividends paid were $\n5.33\nper share in 2023, $\n4.97\nper share in 2022 and $\n4.64\nper share in 2021.\n71\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n—\nThe changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nForeign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income primarily relate to the exit of immaterial foreign operations. Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income represented settlements and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost. Refer to Note 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for the amounts included in net periodic benefit cost.\nThe Company designated the €\n1.0\nbillion of Euro notes issued in May 2014, the €\n1.0\nbillion of Euro notes issued in May 2015, the €\n1.6\nbillion of Euro notes issued in June 2019 and the €\n1.3\nbillion of Euro term loans borrowed under the Euro Credit Agreement in May 2023 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). On February 22, 2022, €\n500\nmillion of the Euro notes issued in May 2014 were redeemed in full and on May 22, 2023, €\n500\nmillion of the Euro notes issued in May 2015 were repaid on the due date. Refer to Note 11. Debt for additional information regarding the redemption of these notes. The amount of pre-tax gain (loss) related to these notes that was recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $(\n109\n) million, $\n205\nmillion and $\n303\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the ending balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of after-tax cumulative translation adjustment losses of $\n1.5\nbillion in both periods, and after-tax unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $\n327\nmillion and $\n293\nmillion, respectively.\n(15)\nStock-Based Compensation\nOn May 8, 2015 (the \"Effective Date\"), the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \"2015 Plan\") was approved by shareholders. The 2015 Plan allows for the issuance of up to\n10\nmillion shares of ITW common stock for awards granted under the plan. As of the Effective Date, no additional awards will be granted to employees under the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \"2011 Plan\"). The significant terms of stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") were not changed under the 2015 Plan. Stock options and RSUs are issued to officers and/or other management employees under these plans. Stock options generally vest over a\nfour-year\nperiod and have an expiration of\nten years\nfrom the issuance date. RSUs generally \"cliff\" vest after a\nthree-year\nperiod and include units with and without performance criteria. RSUs with performance criteria provide for full \"cliff\" vesting after\nthree years\nif the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors certifies that the performance goals have been met. Upon vesting, the holder will receive\none\nshare of common stock of the Company for each vested restricted stock unit.\nCommencing in February 2013, the Company began issuing shares from treasury stock to cover the exercised options and vested RSUs. Prior to February 2013, the Company generally issued new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool.\n72\nThe Company records compensation expense for the grant date fair value of stock awards over the remaining service periods of those awards.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's stock-based compensation expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nThe following table summarizes activity related to non-vested RSUs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023:\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023:\nThe fair value of RSUs is equal to the common stock fair market value on the date of the grant. RSUs provide for dividend equivalents payable in additional RSUs for dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period. Stock option exercise prices are equal to the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. The Company estimates forfeitures based on historical rates for awards with similar characteristics. The Company uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted.\nThe following summarizes the assumptions used in the option valuations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nLattice-based option valuation models, such as the binomial option pricing model, incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on the Company's stock and historical volatility of the Company's stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise timing and employee termination rates within the valuation model. The weighted-average dividend yield is based on historical information.
