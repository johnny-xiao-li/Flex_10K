    "text": "Pinnacle West\nPinnacle West is a holding company that conducts business through its subsidiaries.  We derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS.  APS is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona.\nPinnacle West’s other subsidiaries are El Dorado, PNW Power, and 4CA.  BCE was a subsidiary of Pinnacle West, but was sold in January 2024.  Additional information related to these subsidiaries is provided later in this report.\nOur reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load customers) and related activities, and includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.\nBUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY\nAPS currently provides electric service to approximately 1.4 million customers.  We own or lease 6,491 MW of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both long-term and short-term purchased power agreements for additional capacity.  During 2023, no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 2.1% of our electric revenues.\n3\nThe following map shows APS’s retail service territory, including the locations of its generating facilities and principal transmission lines.\n4\nEnergy Sources and Resource Planning\nTo serve its customers, APS obtains power through its various generation stations and through purchased power agreements.  Resource planning is an important function necessary to meet Arizona’s future energy needs.  APS’s sources of energy by type used to supply energy to Native Load customers during 2023 were as follows:\n*Renewables include energy from wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass, and DG.\nThe share of APS’s energy supply being derived from clean resources was approximately 51% in 2023, which includes energy from nuclear, renewables and DSM.\nClean Energy Focus Initiatives\nIn response to climate change, the entire electric utility industry, as well as the global economy, is in the midst of a profound transition to clean energy and a new low-carbon economy.  APS has undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce carbon, including renewable energy procurement and development, and promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation, renewable energy use, and energy efficiency.  See “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Current and Future Resources” below for details of these plans and initiatives.  APS currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources, including solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, and biomass.  In addition, in January 2020, APS announced its Clean Energy Commitment, a three-pronged approach aimed at ultimately eliminating carbon-emitting resources from its electric generation resource portfolio.\n5\nAPS’s Clean Energy Commitment consists of three parts:\n•\nA 2050 goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity;\n•\nA 2030 target to achieve a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy; and\n•\nA commitment to exit from coal-fired generation by 2031.\nAmong other strategies, APS intends to achieve these goals through various methods such as relying on Palo Verde, one of the nation’s largest producers of carbon-free energy; increasing clean energy resources, including renewables; developing energy storage; exiting from coal-generated electricity; managing demand with a modern interactive grid; promoting customer technology and energy efficiency; and optimizing regional resources.  Management takes into consideration climate change and other environmental risks in its strategy development, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes.  See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about APS’s Clean Energy Commitment.\nOver this same period of time, APS also intends to harden its infrastructure in order to improve climate resiliency, which involves system and operational improvements aimed at reducing the impact of extreme weather events and other climate-related disruptions upon APS’s operations.  Among other resiliency strategies, APS anticipates increasing investments in a modern and more flexible electricity grid with advanced distribution technologies.  APS plans to continue its comprehensive forest management programs aimed at reducing wildfires, as those risks become compounded by shorter, drier winters and longer, hotter summers as a result of climate change.\nAPS prepares an annual inventory of GHG emissions from its operations.  For APS’s operations involving fossil-fuel electricity generation and electricity transmission and distribution, APS’s annual GHG inventory is reported to the EPA under the EPA GHG Reporting Program.  In addition to reporting to the EPA, we publicly report Scope 1 and 2, as well as a limited number of Scope 3, GHG emissions.  This data is then communicated to the public in Pinnacle West’s annual Corporate Responsibility Report as performance data and in CDP Reports, which are available on our website (\nwww.pinnaclewest.com/corporate-responsibility\n).  The reports provide information related to the Company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance.  The information on Pinnacle West’s website, including Corporate Responsibility Reports and CDP Reports, is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report.\nGeneration Facilities\nAPS has ownership interests in or leases the nuclear, gas, oil, coal, and solar generating facilities as well as energy storage facilities described below.  For additional information regarding these facilities, see Item 2.\nNuclear\nPalo Verde Generating Station —\nPalo Verde is a 3-unit nuclear power plant located approximately 50 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona.  APS operates the plant and owns 29.1% of Palo Verde Units 1 and 3 and approximately 17% of Unit 2.  In addition, APS leases approximately 12.1% of Unit 2, resulting in a 29.1% combined ownership and leasehold interest in that unit.  APS has a total entitlement from Palo Verde of 1,146 MW.\n6\nPalo Verde Leases —\nIn 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back approximately 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common facilities.  The leaseback was originally scheduled to expire at the end of 2015 and contained options to renew the leases or to purchase the leased property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms.  On July 7, 2014, APS exercised the fixed rate lease renewal options.  The exercise of the renewal options originally resulted in APS retaining the assets through 2023 under one lease and 2033 under the other two leases.  On April 1, 2021, APS executed an amendment relating to the lease agreement with the term ending in 2023.  The amendment extends the lease term for this lease through 2033 and changes the lease payment.  As a result of this amendment, APS will now retain the assets through 2033 under all three lease agreements.  At the end of the lease renewal periods, APS will have the option to purchase the leased assets at their fair market value, extend the leases for up to two years, or return the assets to the lessors.  See Note 17 for additional information regarding the Palo Verde Unit 2 sale leaseback transactions.\nPalo Verde Operating Licenses\n— Operation of each of the three Palo Verde Units requires an operating license from the NRC.  The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in June 1985, Unit 2 in April 1986, and Unit 3 in November 1987, and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in April 2011, which extended the licenses for Units 1, 2, and 3 to June 2045, April 2046, and November 2047, respectively.\nPalo Verde Fuel Cycle —\nThe participant owners of Palo Verde are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs.  The fuel cycle for Palo Verde is comprised of the following stages:\n•\nMining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates;\n•\nConversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride;\n•\nEnrichment of uranium hexafluoride;\n•\nFabrication of fuel assemblies;\n•\nUtilization of fuel assemblies in reactors; and\n•\nStorage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.\nThe Palo Verde participants have contracted for 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2028 and 48% through 2029; 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for conversion services through 2029 and 75% through 2030; 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for enrichment services through 2026 and 28% for 2027; and 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for fuel fabrication through 2027 for Unit 2 and Unit 1 and 2028 for Unit 3.\nSpent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal —\nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (“NWPA”) required the DOE to begin to accept, transport, and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998.  The DOE’s obligations are reflected in a contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (the “Standard Contract”) with each nuclear power plant.  The DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998.  The DOE had planned to meet its NWPA and Standard Contract disposal obligations by designing, licensing, constructing, and operating a permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  In June 2008, the DOE submitted its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application to the NRC, but in March 2010, the DOE filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the Yucca Mountain construction\n7\nauthorization application.  Several legal proceedings followed challenging DOE’s withdrawal of its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application and the NRC’s cessation of its review of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application, which were consolidated into one matter at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the “D.C. Circuit”).  Following the D.C. Circuit’s August 2013 order, the NRC issued two volumes of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application.  Publication of these volumes does not signal whether or when the NRC might authorize construction of the repository.  APS is directly involved in legal proceedings related to the DOE’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste.\nAPS Lawsuit for Breach of Standard Contract\n— In December 2003, APS, acting on behalf of itself and the Palo Verde participants, filed a lawsuit against the DOE in the United States Court of Federal Claims (“Court of Federal Claims”) for damages incurred due to the DOE’s breach of the Standard Contract.  The Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of APS and the Palo Verde participants in October 2010 and awarded damages to APS and the Palo Verde participants for costs incurred through December 2006.\nOn December 19, 2012, APS, acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of Palo Verde, filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the DOE in the United States Court of Federal Claims.  The lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to DOE’s breach of the Standard Contract for failing to accept Palo Verde’s spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2011, pursuant to the terms of the Standard Contract and the NWPA.  On August 18, 2014, APS and DOE entered into a settlement agreement, which required DOE to pay the Palo Verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by Palo Verde during the period January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2011.  In addition, the settlement agreement provided APS with a method for submitting claims and getting recovery for costs incurred through December 31, 2016, which was extended to December 31, 2025.\nAPS has submitted nine claims pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014 settlement agreement, for nine\nseparate time periods during July 1, 2011 through October 31, 2022.\nThe DOE has approved and paid\n$138.2 million for these claims (APS’s share is $40.2 million).\nThe amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income.\nIn accordance with the 2017 Rate Case Decision, this regulatory liability is being refunded to customers.\nSee Note 3.  On October 31, 2023, APS filed its tenth claim pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014, settlement agreement in the amount of $18.46 million (APS’s share is $5.4 million). In February 2024, the DOE approved $18.39 million of this claim.\nWaste Confidence\nand Continued Storage\n— On June 8, 2012, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the NRC’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel.  The petitioners had challenged the NRC’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule (“Waste Confidence Decision”).  The D.C. Circuit found that the NRC’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient, and therefore remanded the Waste Confidence Decision update for further action consistent with National Environmental Policy Act.  In September 2013, the NRC issued its draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement (“GEIS”) to support an updated Waste Confidence Decision.  On August 26, 2014, the NRC approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel.  Renamed as the Continued Storage Rule, the NRC’s decision adopted the findings of the GEIS regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations.  As a result, those generic impacts do not need to be re-analyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses.  The final Continued Storage Rule was\n8\nsubject to continuing legal challenges before the NRC and the Court of Appeals.  In June 2016, the D.C. Circuit issued its final decision, rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the Continued Storage Rule.  On August 8, 2016, the D.C. Circuit denied a petition for rehearing.\nPalo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site independent spent fuel storage installation (“ISFSI”) to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period, which ends in December 2027.  Additionally, Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation, which ends in November 2047.  If uncertainties regarding the United States government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, APS will evaluate expanding the ISFSI, or alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI, to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation.\nNuclear Decommissioning Costs\n— APS currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the NRC financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3.  The decommissioning costs of Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3 are currently included in APS’s ACC jurisdictional rates.  Decommissioning costs are recoverable through a non-bypassable system benefits charge (paid by all retail customers taking service from the APS system).  Based on current nuclear decommissioning trust asset balances, site specific decommissioning cost studies, anticipated future contributions to the decommissioning trusts, and return projections on the asset portfolios over the expected remaining operating life of the facility, we are on track to meet the current site-specific decommissioning costs for Palo Verde at the time the units are expected to be decommissioned.  See Note 18 for additional information about APS’s nuclear decommissioning trusts.\nPalo Verde Liability and Insurance Matters\n— See “Palo Verde Generating Station — Nuclear Insurance” in Note 10 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the Palo Verde participants, including APS, for Palo Verde.\nNatural Gas and Oil Fueled Generating Facilities\nAPS has six natural gas power plants located throughout Arizona, consisting of Redhawk, located near Palo Verde; Ocotillo, located in Tempe (discussed below); Sundance, located in Coolidge; West Phoenix, located in southwest Phoenix; Saguaro, located north of Tucson; and Yucca, located near Yuma.  Several of the units at Yucca run on either gas or oil.  APS has two oil-only power plants: Douglas, located in the town of Douglas, Arizona and Yucca GT-4 in Yuma, Arizona.  APS owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one oil-only combustion turbine unit and one oil and gas steam unit at Yucca that are operated by APS and owned by the Imperial Irrigation District.  APS has a total entitlement from these plants of 3,573 MW.  A portion of the gas for these plants is financially hedged up to three years in advance of purchasing and that position is converted to a physical gas purchase one month prior to delivery.  APS has long-term gas transportation agreements with three different companies, some of which are effective through 2052.  Fuel oil is acquired under short-term purchases delivered by truck directly to the power plants.\nOcotillo was originally a 330 MW 4-unit gas plant located in Tempe.  In early 2014, APS announced a project to modernize the plant, which involved retiring two older 110 MW steam units, adding five 102 MW combustion turbines, and maintaining two existing 55 MW combustion turbines.  In total, this increased the capacity of the site by 290 MW to 620 MW.  The Ocotillo modernization project was completed in 2019.\n9\nCoal Fueled Generating Facilities\nFour Corners\n— Four Corners is located in the northwestern corner of New Mexico and was originally a 5-unit coal-fired power plant.  APS owns 100% of Units 1, 2 and 3, which were retired as of December 30, 2013.  APS operates the plant and owns 63% of Four Corners Units 4 and 5.  APS has a total entitlement from Four Corners of 970 MW.  As part of APS’s Clean Energy Commitment, APS has committed to exit coal-fired generation as part of its portfolio of electricity generating resources, including Four Corners, by 2031.\nNTEC, a company formed by the Navajo Nation to own the mine that serves Four Corners and develop other energy projects, is the coal supplier for Four Corners.  The Four Corners co-owners executed a long-term agreement for the supply of coal to Four Corners from July 2016 through 2031 (the “2016 Coal Supply Agreement”).\nAPS, on behalf of the Four Corners participants, negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the Navajo Nation, which extends the Four Corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041.  The Navajo Nation approved these amendments in March 2011.  The effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the DOI, as did a related federal rights-of-way grant.  A federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the DOI review process and culminated in the issuance by DOI of a record of decision on July 17, 2015, justifying the agency action to extend the life of the plant and the adjacent mine.\nIn June 2021, APS and the owners of Four Corners entered into an agreement that would allow Four Corners to operate seasonally at the election of the owners as early as fall 2023, subject to the necessary governmental approvals and conditions associated with changes in plant ownership.\nUnder seasonal operation, one generating unit would be shut down during seasons where electricity demand is reduced, such as the winter and spring.\nThe other unit would remain online year-round, subject to market conditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages.\nAs of the date of this report, APS has elected not to begin seasonal operation due to market conditions.\nCholla\n— Cholla was originally a 4-unit coal-fired power plant, which is located in northeastern Arizona.  APS operates the plant and owns 100% of Cholla Units 1, 2 and 3.  PacifiCorp owns Cholla Unit 4, and APS operated that unit for PacifiCorp.  On September 11, 2014, APS announced that it would close Cholla Unit 2 and cease burning coal at the other APS-owned units (Units 1 and 3) at the plant by the mid-2020s, if EPA approved a compromise proposal offered by APS to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules.  On April 14, 2015, the ACC approved APS’s plan to retire Unit 2, without expressing any view on the future recoverability of APS’s remaining investment in the Unit.  APS closed Unit 2 on October 1, 2015.  Following the closure of Unit 2, APS has a total entitlement from Cholla of 381 MW.  In early 2017, EPA approved a final rule incorporating APS’s compromise proposal, which took effect for Cholla on April 26, 2017.  In December 2019, PacifiCorp notified APS that it planned to retire Cholla Unit 4 by the end of 2020 and the unit ceased operation in December 2020.  APS has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining Cholla units during 2025.\nAPS purchases all of Cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under long-term leases of coal reserves with the federal and state governments and private landholders.  The Cholla coal contract runs through 2024.  In addition, APS has a coal transportation contract that runs through 2024.\n10\nNavajo Plant\n— The Navajo Plant was a 3-unit coal-fired power plant located in northern Arizona.  Salt River Project operated the plant and APS owned a 14% interest in Units 1, 2 and 3.  APS had a total entitlement from the Navajo Plant of 315 MW.  The Navajo Plant site is leased from the Navajo Nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government.\nThe co-owners of the Navajo Plant and the Navajo Nation agreed that the Navajo Plant would remain in operation until December 2019 under the existing plant lease.  The co-owners and the Navajo Nation executed a lease extension on November 29, 2017, which allowed for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceased operations in November 2019.\nAPS is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the Navajo Plant over its previously estimated life through 2026.  APS will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant.  See Note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset plus a return on the net book value as well as other costs related to retirement and closure, which are still being assessed and which may be material.\nSee Note 10 for information regarding APS’s coal mine reclamation obligations related to these coal-fired plants.\nSolar Facilities\nAPS developed utility scale solar resources through the 180 MW ACC-approved AZ Sun Program, investing approximately $675 million in this program.  These facilities are owned by APS and are located in multiple locations throughout Arizona.  In addition to the AZ Sun Program, APS developed the 44 MW Red Rock Solar Plant and the 150 MW Agave Solar Plant, each of which it owns and operates.  Two of our large customers purchase renewable energy credits from APS that are equivalent to the amount of renewable energy that Red Rock is projected to generate.\nAPS owns and operates more than thirty small solar systems around the state.  Together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 MW of renewable energy.  This fleet of solar systems includes a  3 MW facility located at the Prescott Airport and 1 MW of small solar systems in various locations across Arizona.  APS has also developed solar photovoltaic DG systems installed as part of the Community Power Project in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The Community Power Project, approved by the ACC on April 1, 2010, was a pilot program through which APS owns, operates, and receives energy from approximately 1 MW of solar photovoltaic DG systems located within a certain test area in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The pilot program is now complete and as part of the 2017 Rate Case Decision, the participants have been transferred to the Solar Partner Program described below.  Additionally, APS owns 13 MW of solar photovoltaic systems installed across Arizona through the ACC-approved Schools and Government Program.\nIn December 2014, the ACC voted that it had no objection to APS implementing an APS-owned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid.  The first stage of the program, called the “Solar Partner Program,” placed 8 MW of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits, as well as made systems available to limited-income customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties.  The second stage of the program, which included an additional 2 MW of rooftop solar and energy storage, placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 MW on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various grid-related operation improvements and system interoperability, and was in operation by the end of 2016.  The costs for this program have been included in APS’s rate base as part of the 2017 Rate Case Decision.\n11\nIn the 2017 Rate Case Decision, the ACC also approved the “APS Solar Communities” program.  APS Solar Communities (formerly AZ Sun II) is a three-year program authorizing APS to spend $10 million to $15 million in capital costs each year to install utility-owned DG systems on low to moderate income residential homes, non-profit entities, Title I schools, and rural government facilities.  The 2017 Rate Case Decision provided that all operations and maintenance expenses, property taxes, marketing and advertising expenses, and the capital carrying costs for this program will be recovered through the RES.  Currently, APS has installed 14 MW of DG systems under the APS Solar Communities program.  In the 2019 Rate Case decision, the ACC authorized APS to spend $20 million to $30 million in capital costs for the APS Solar Communities program each year for a period of three years from the effective date of the decision.\nRenewable Energy Portfolio\nTo date, APS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 5,010 MW, including solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and biogas.  Of this portfolio, 3,072 MW are currently in operation and 1,938 MW are under contract for development or are under construction.  Renewable resources in operation include 415 MW of facilities owned by APS, 1,034 MW of long-term purchased power agreements, and an estimated 1,623 MW of customer-sited, third-party owned distributed energy resources.\nOn June 30, 2023, APS issued an All-Source Request for Proposal (“RFP”) seeking approximately 1,000 MW of reliable capacity, including at least 700 MW of renewable resources with a focus on in-service dates between 2026 and 2028 (the “2023 RFP”).  Bids from the 2023 RFP were received on September 6, 2023, and APS has started negotiations on multiple projects, including a 400 MW wind facility PPA that was signed in December 2023.\nAPS’s strategy to achieve its RES requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities, ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by APS.  See “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Solar Facilities” above for information regarding APS-owned solar facilities and “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Energy Storage” below for more information regarding APS-owned energy storage facilities.\nThe following table summarizes APS’s renewable energy sources currently in operation and under development as of December 31, 2023.  Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid.\n12\n(a)\nIncludes Flagstaff Community Power Project, APS School and Government Program, APS Solar Partner Program, and APS Solar Communities Program.\n13\n(b)\nIncludes rooftop solar facilities owned by third parties.  DG is produced in DC and is converted to AC for reporting purposes.\nEnergy Storage\nAPS deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system, including energy storage.  Energy storage provides capacity, improves power quality, can be utilized for system regulation and, in certain circumstances, be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments.  Energy storage also aids in integrating renewable generation by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset.  APS is utilizing grid-scale energy storage projects to meet customer reliability requirements, increase renewable utilization, and further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid.\nAs noted above, on June 30, 2023, APS issued the 2023 RFP seeking approximately 1,000 MW of reliable capacity, including at least 700 MW of renewable resources, including energy storage, with a focus on in-service dates between 2026 and 2028.\nAPS currently plans to install more than 2,700 MW of utility scale energy storage by 2026, including through energy storage projects under PPAs and AZ Sun retrofits as well as through resources solicited through current and future RFPs.\nThe following table summarizes the resources in APS’s energy storage portfolio that are in operation and under development as of December 31, 2023.\nAgreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions.\n(a)     Includes 0.3 MW of APS-owned customer-sited batteries.\n(b)    Includes 19 MW of capacity that entered commercial operation in January 2024.\nPurchased Power Contracts\nIn addition to its own available generating capacity, APS purchases electricity under various arrangements, including long-term contracts and purchases through short-term markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements.  A portion of APS’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  See Note 15.  APS continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability.  In addition, APS has also entered into several PPAs for energy storage.  See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Energy Storage” above for details on our energy storage PPAs.\n14\nPurchased Power Capacity —\nAPS’s purchased power capacity under long-term contracts as of December 31, 2023, is summarized in the table below.  All capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted.\n(a)\nUp to 46 MW of capacity is available; however, the amount of electricity available to APS under this agreement is based in large part on customer demand and is adjusted annually.\n(b)\nDoes not include MW of capacity planned or under development.  Renewable energy purchased power agreements are described in detail below under “Current and Future Resources — Renewable Energy Standard.”\nCurrent and Future Resources\nCurrent Demand and Reserve Margin\nElectric power demand is generally seasonal.  In Arizona, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months.  APS’s 2023 peak one-hour demand on its electric system was recorded on July 15, 2023, at 8,162 MW, compared to the 2022 peak of 7,587 MW recorded on July 11, 2022.  APS’s reserve margin at the time of the 2023 peak demand, calculated using system load serving capacity, was 18%.  For 2024, due to expiring purchased power contracts, APS is procuring market resources to maintain its minimum 16% planning reserve criteria.\nFuture Resources and Resource Plan\nACC rules require utilities to develop 15-year Integrated Resource Plans (“IRP”) which describe how the utility plans to serve customer load in the plan timeframe.  The ACC reviews each utility’s IRP to determine if it meets the necessary rule requirements and whether it should be acknowledged.  APS was originally required to file its IRP by August 1, 2023.  However, on May 1, 2023, APS, Tucson Electric Company, and UNS Electric, Inc., filed a joint request to extend the IRP filing due date to November 1, 2023, which the ACC granted on June 21, 2023.  APS filed its 2023 IRP on November 1, 2023.  On January 31, 2024, stakeholders filed comments regarding the IRP.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  On October 4, 2023, the ACC updated the IRP processing timeline with a due date of August 30, 2024 for the ACC Staff Assessment and Proposed Order and an open meeting decision due date yet to be determined.\nSee “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Clean Energy Focus Initiatives” and “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Energy Storage” above for information regarding future plans for energy storage.\n15\nSee “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Coal-Fueled Generating Facilities” above for information regarding plans for Cholla, Four Corners and the Navajo Plant.\nWestern Energy Imbalance Market & Wholesale Market\nIn 2016, APS began to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market (“WEIM”), a voluntary, real-time optimization market operated by the CAISO.  The WEIM allows for rebalancing supply and demand in 15-minute blocks and dispatching generation every five minutes, instead of the traditional one-hour blocks.  APS continues to expect that its participation in WEIM will lower its fuel and purchased-power costs, improve situational awareness for system operations in the Western Interconnection power grid, and improve integration of APS’s renewable resources.  APS is participating in market design and tariff development of Markets+, a day-ahead and real-time market offering from Southwest Power Pool.  APS also participated in the design and drafting of the tariff for the CAISO’s Extended Day-Ahead Market, which was approved by FERC in December 2023.  In addition, APS is participating in the Western Resource Adequacy Program administered by Western Power Pool.  These efforts are driven by three objectives of reducing customer cost, improving reliability, and incorporating more clean energy on APS’s system.\nEnergy Modernization Plan\nOn July 30, 2020, the ACC Staff issued final draft energy rules, which proposed 100% of retail kWh sales from clean energy resources by the end of 2050.  Nuclear power was defined as a clean energy resource.  The proposed rules also required 50% of retail energy served be renewable by the end of 2035.  On November 13, 2020, the ACC approved a final draft energy rules package which required additional procedural steps in the rulemaking process.  In June 2021, the ACC adopted clean energy rules based on a series of ACC amendments to the final energy rules.  The adopted rules require 100% clean energy by 2070 and the following interim standards for carbon reduction from a baseline carbon emissions level: 50% reduction by December 31, 2032; 65% reduction by December 31, 2040; 80% reduction by December 31, 2050, and 95% reduction by December 31, 2060.  Since the adopted clean energy rules differed substantially from the original Recommended Order and Opinion, supplemental rulemaking procedures were required before the rules could become effective.  On January 26, 2022, the ACC reversed its prior decision and declined to send the final draft energy rules through the rulemaking process.  Instead, the ACC opened a new docket to consider All-Source RFP requirements and the IRP process.  During the August 2022 ACC Open Meeting, the ACC voted to postpone a decision on the All-Source RFP and IRP rulemaking package until 2023.  On May 26, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to review articles within the Arizona Administrative Code related to Resource Planning, the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, and Electric Energy Efficiency Standards.  On January 9, 2024, the ACC approved a rulemaking process to begin on this matter.  During the ACC Open Meeting on February 6, 2024, the ACC approved motions to direct ACC Staff to include recommendations to repeal the current Electric Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Standard rules during the rulemaking process.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  See Note 3 for additional information related to these energy rules.\nRenewable Energy Standard\nIn 2006, the ACC adopted the RES.  Under the RES, electric utilities that are regulated by the ACC must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources, including solar, wind, biomass, biogas, and geothermal technologies.  The renewable energy requirement is 13% of retail electric sales in 2023 and increases annually until it reaches 15% in 2025.\n16\nA component of the RES is focused on stimulating development of DG systems.  Accordingly, under the RES, an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources.  This distributed renewable energy requirement, which was waived by the ACC as a part of APS’s 2023 RES Implementation Plan, would have been 30% of the overall RES requirement of 13% in 2023.  On June 7, 2021, the ACC approved the 2021 RES Implementation Plan.  On July 1, 2021, APS filed its 2022 RES Implementation Plan, which was subsequently amended on December 9, 2021.  On  May 18, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 RES Implementation Plan, including an amendment requiring a stakeholder working group convene to develop a community solar program for the ACC’s consideration at a future date.  On September 23, 2022, APS filed a community solar proposal in compliance with the ACC order that was informed by a stakeholder working group.  APS proposed a small, pilot scale program size of up to 140 MW that would be selected through a competitive RFP.  The ACC has not yet ruled on the proposal.  However, on November 10, 2022, the ACC approved a bifurcated community solar process, directing ACC Staff to develop a statewide policy through additional stakeholder involvement and establishing a separate evidentiary hearing to define other policy components.  On   March 23, 2023, the ACC approved a policy statement that included information on how statewide community solar and storage programs should be structured, their location, and inclusion in RFPs.  The remainder of the community solar program policy components were deferred to the ACC’s Hearing Division so that a formal evidentiary hearing could be held to consider issues of substance related to community solar.  APS cannot predict the outcomes of these future activities.\nOn June 30, 2023, APS filed its 2024 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $95.1 million.  APS’s budget proposal supports existing approved projects and commitments and requests a waiver of the RES renewable energy credit requirements to demonstrate compliance with the Annual Renewable Energy Requirement for 2023.  The ACC has not yet ruled on the 2024 RES Implementation Plan.  The following table summarizes the RES requirement standard and its timing:\n(a)\nThe distributed renewable energy requirement has been waived for 2023.\nOn April 21, 2015, the RES rules were amended to require utilities to report on all eligible renewable resources in their service territory, irrespective of whether the utility owns renewable energy credits associated with such renewable energy.  The rules allow the ACC to consider such information in determining whether APS has satisfied the requirements of the RES.\nDemand Side Management\nOn January 1, 2011, Arizona regulators adopted an EES of 22% cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 to increase energy efficiency and other DSM programs encouraging customers to conserve energy, while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy.  APS achieved the 22% EES in 2021.  See Note 3 for information regarding energy efficiency, other DSM obligations and the Energy Modernization Plan.\n17\nCompetitive Environment and Regulatory Oversight\nRetail\nThe ACC regulates APS’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities.  The ACC must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of APS’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between Pinnacle West, APS, and their respective affiliates.  See Note 3 for information regarding ACC’s regulation of APS’s retail electric rates.\nAPS is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor-owned electric and gas utilities in Arizona (such as Southwest Gas Corporation), as well as cooperatives, municipalities, electrical districts, and similar types of governmental or non-profit organizations.  In addition, some customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements.  This practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs.\nOn May 9, 2013, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona.  The ACC subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state.  One of these considerations was whether various aspects of a deregulated market, including setting utility rates on a “market” basis, would be consistent with the requirements of the Arizona Constitution.  On September 11, 2013, after receiving legal advice from the ACC Staff, the ACC voted 4-1 to close the current docket and await full Arizona Constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter.  The motion approved by the ACC also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing cost-of-service regulatory model that could include elements of competition.\nOn November 17, 2018, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona.  On July 1 and July 2, 2019, ACC Staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules.  On February 10, 2020, two ACC Commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules.  On February 12, 2020, ACC Staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules.  During a July 15, 2020 ACC Staff meeting, the ACC Commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program, but no action was taken.  The\nACC continues to discuss matters related to\nretail electric competition, including the potential for additional buy-through programs or other pilot programs.  In April 2022, the Arizona Legislature passed, and the Governor signed, a bill that repealed the electric deregulation law that had been in place in Arizona since 1998.  APS cannot predict what impact, if any, this change will have on APS.\nOn August 4, 2021, Green Mountain Energy filed an application seeking a certificate of convenience and necessity to allow it to provide competitive electric generation service in Arizona.\nGreen Mountain Energy has requested that the ACC grant it the ability to provide competitive service in APS’s and Tucson Electric Power Company’s certificated service territories and proposes to deliver a 100% renewable energy product to residential and general service customers in those service territories.  APS opposes Green Mountain Energy’s application.  On November 3, 2021, the ACC submitted questions to the Arizona Attorney General, Civil Litigation Division, Consumer Protection & Advocacy Section (“Attorney General”) requesting legal opinions related to a number of issues surrounding retail electric competition and the ACC’s ability to issue competitive certificates convenience and necessity.  On November 26, 2021,\n18\nthe Administrative Law Judge issued a procedural order indicating it would not be appropriate to set a schedule until the Attorney General has provided insights on the applicable law.  As the ACC’s questions pertained to the retail competition law subsequently repealed in April 2022, the Attorney General has not responded to the ACC’s request and the questions are now moot.  No action has been taken by the ACC regarding this application since that time.  However, on May 17, 2023, the Retail Energy Supply Association filed a motion with the ACC requesting it to re-open the generic docket to re-examine the ACC’s electric competition rules.  No action has been taken by the ACC regarding this motion.  APS cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nOn October 28, 2021, an ACC Commissioner docketed a letter directing ACC Staff and interested stakeholders to design a 200 to 300 MW pilot program that would allow residential and small commercial customers of APS to elect a competitive electricity supplier.  The letter also states that similar programs should be designed for other Arizona regulated electric utilities.  APS cannot predict the outcome of these future activities.\nWholesale\nFERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services.  See Note 3 for information regarding APS’s transmission rates.  During 2023, approximately 7.4% of APS’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services.  APS’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements.  APS also sells, in the wholesale market, its generation output that is not needed for APS’s Native Load and, in doing so, competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers.  Additionally, subject to specified parameters, APS hedges both electricity and natural gas.  The majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in APS’s portfolio.\nTransmission and Delivery\nAPS continues to work closely with customers, stakeholders, and regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that support new customers, system reliability, access to markets and clean energy development.  The capital expenditures table presented in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this report includes new APS transmission projects, along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements, including those for data center and semi-conductor manufacturing development.  To prioritize reliability and meet substantial growth in residential and commercial energy needs, APS has developed a future-focused, strategic transmission plan.  This Ten-Year Plan includes five critical transmission projects that comprise the APS strategic transmission portfolio, which represents a significant upgrade to APS’s transmission system.  These five projects, along with other projects included in the Ten-Year Plan, are intended to support growing energy needs, strengthen reliability, and allow for the connection of new resources.\nAPS is also working to establish and expand advanced grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide long-term benefits both to APS and its customers.  APS is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better manage their energy usage, minimize system outage durations and frequency, enable customer choice for new customer sited technologies, and facilitate greater cost savings to APS through improved reliability and the automation of certain delivery functions.\n19\nEnvironmental Matters\nClimate Change\nLegislative Initiatives.\nThere have been no recent successful attempts by Congress to pass legislation that would regulate GHG emissions, and it is unclear at this time whether legislation regulating or limiting utility-sector GHG emissions under consideration in the 118th Congress will become law.  In the event climate change legislation ultimately passes, the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on APS depends on a variety of factors, none of which can be fully known until a law is written, enacted, and the specifics of the resulting program are established.  These factors include, without limitation, the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed GHG emissions; the cost to reduce emissions; in the event a cap-and-trade program is established, whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned (and, if so, the cost of those allowances in the marketplace) and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available; and, in the event of a carbon tax, the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide (“CO\n2\n”) equivalent emitted.\nIn addition to federal legislative initiatives, state-specific initiatives may also impact our business.  While Arizona has no pending legislation regulating GHGs, the California legislature enacted AB 32 and SB 1368 in 2006 to address GHG emissions.  In October 2011, the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) approved final regulations that established a state-wide cap on GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2013, and established a GHG allowance trading program under that cap.  The first phase of the program, which applies to, among other entities, importers of electricity, commenced on January 1, 2013.  Under the program, entities selling electricity into California, including APS, must hold carbon allowances to cover GHG emissions associated with electricity sales into California from outside the state.  APS is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the PSA.\nRegulatory Initiatives.\nIn 2009, EPA determined that GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare.  As a result of this “endangerment finding,” EPA determined that the Clean Air Act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major GHG emitting sources, including power plants.  APS will generally be required to consider the impact of GHG emissions as part of its traditional New Source Review analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants.\nEPA’s regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from electric utility power plants has proceeded in fits and starts over most of the last decade.  Starting on August 3, 2015, EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, which was the Agency’s first effort at such regulation through system-wide generation dispatch shifting.  Those regulations were subsequently repealed by the EPA on June 19, 2019 and replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) regulations, which were a far narrower set of rules.  While the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit subsequently vacated the ACE regulations on January 19, 2021, and ordered a remand for EPA to develop replacement regulations consistent with the original 2015 Clean Power Plan, the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently reversed that decision on June 30, 2022, holding that the Clean Power Plan exceeded EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.\nIn the latest set of proposed rules, released on May 23, 2023, EPA contemplates emission standards and guidelines for various subcategories of new and existing power plants.  Unlike EPA’s Clean Power Plan regulations from 2015, which took a broad, system-wide approach to regulating carbon emissions from electric utility fossil-fuel burning power plants, the most recent proposal is limited to measures that can be installed at individual power plants to limit planet-warming emissions.\n20\nFor new natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants, EPA is proposing that carbon emission performance standards apply based on the annual capacity factors.  For the highest utilization combustion turbines, EPA is therefore proposing that such facilities be retrofitted for carbon capture and sequestration or utilization controls (“CCS”) or varying levels of hydrogen gas (“H2”) co-firing.  As for existing natural gas-fired combustion turbines, EPA is imposing similar control requirements at large, high utilization generating units, but is otherwise not proceeding at this time with further regulation.  Under EPA’s proposal, this means that both new and existing peaking gas-fired combustion turbines (i.e., those with a 20% or less annual capacity factor) are effectively unregulated under the proposed regulations.\nFor coal-fired power plants, instead of imposing regulations based on capacity and utilization, EPA has developed subcategories based on planned retirement dates.  This means that facilities retiring between 2030 and before 2040 must meet increasingly stringent emission limits up to natural-gas co-firing starting in 2030.  However, for those facilities with no planned retirement date prior to 2040, EPA is requiring those plants to be retrofitted with CCS controls by 2030.\nAt this time, APS cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking or when EPA will take final action.  In addition, APS is continuing to evaluate this proposal and its potential impact on APS’s operations.  Depending on the eventual outcome, the costs associated with APS’s operation of its current and future thermal power plants could materially increase, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOther environmental rules that could involve material compliance costs include those related to effluent limitations, the ozone national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) and other rules or matters involving the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, RCRA, Superfund, the Navajo Nation, and water supplies for our power plants.  The financial impact of complying with current and future environmental rules could jeopardize the economic viability of APS’s fossil-fuel powered plants or the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any required equipment upgrades or continue their participation in these plants.  The economics of continuing to own certain resources, particularly our coal plants, may deteriorate, warranting early retirement of those plants, which may result in asset impairments.  APS would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery.\nEPA Environmental Regulation\nCoal Combustion Waste.\nOn December 19, 2014, EPA issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of CCR, such as fly ash and bottom ash.  The rule regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D of the RCRA and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions.  These criteria include standards governing\nlocation restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and internet posting requirements.  The rule generally requires any existing unlined CCR surface impoundment to stop receiving CCR and either retrofit or close, and further requires the closure of any CCR landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity.  Such closure requirements are deemed “forced closure” or “closure for cause” of unlined surface impoundments and are the subject of recent regulatory and judicial activities described below.\nSince these regulations were finalized, EPA has taken steps to substantially modify the federal rules governing CCR disposal.  While certain changes have been prompted by utility industry petitions,\n21\nothers have resulted from judicial review, court-approved settlements with environmental groups, and statutory changes to RCRA.  The following lists the pending regulatory changes that, if finalized, could have a material impact as to how APS manages CCR at its coal-fired power plants:\n•\nFollowing the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act in 2016, EPA possesses authority to either authorize states to develop their own permit programs for CCR management or issue federal permits governing CCR disposal both in states without their own permit programs and on tribal lands.  Although ADEQ has taken steps to develop a CCR permitting program,\nand new state legislation has been adopted providing\nADEQ with appropriate permitting authority for CCR under the state solid waste management program, it is not clear when that program will be put into effect.  On December 19, 2019, EPA proposed its own set of regulations governing the issuance of CCR management permits,\nwhich would impact facilities like Four Corners located on the Navajo Nation.\nThe proposal remains pending.\n•\nOn March 1, 2018, as a result of a settlement with certain environmental groups, EPA proposed adding boron to the list of constituents that trigger corrective action requirements to remediate groundwater impacted by CCR disposal activities.  Apart from a subsequent proposal issued on August 14, 2019, to add a specific, health-based groundwater protection standard for boron, EPA has yet to take action on this proposal.\n•\nWith respect to APS’s Cholla facility, APS’s application for alternative closure was submitted to EPA on November 30, 2020.  While EPA has deemed APS’s application administratively “complete,” the Agency’s approval remains pending.  If granted, this application would allow the continued disposal of CCR within Cholla’s existing unlined CCR surface impoundments until the required date for ceasing coal-fired boiler operations in April 2025.  This application will be subject to public comment and, potentially, judicial review.  On January 11, 2022, EPA began issuing proposed decisions pursuant to this provision of the federal CCR regulations and APS anticipates receiving a proposed decision with respect to the Cholla facility in 2024.\n•\nOn May 18, 2023, EPA published a proposal that expands the scope of federal CCR regulations to address the impacts from historical CCR disposal activities that would have ceased prior to 2015.  EPA proposes to defi\nne a new class of CCR management units (“CCRMUs”) that broadly encompass any location at an operating coal-fired power plant where CCR would have been placed on land.  As proposed, this would include not only historically closed landfills and surface impoundments but also prior applications of CCR beneficial use.  EPA expects to finalize this proposal by spring of 2024.\nWe cannot at this time predict the outcome of these regulatory proceedings or when the EPA will take final action on those matters that are still pending.\nDepending on the eventual outcome, the costs associated with APS’s management of CCR could materially increase, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAPS currently disposes of CCR in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Cholla and Four Corners.\nThe Navajo Plant disposed of CCR only in a dry landfill storage area.\nTo comply with the CCR rule for the Navajo Plant, APS’s share of incremental costs was approximately $1 million, which has been incurred.\nAdditionally, the CCR rule requires ongoing, phased groundwater monitoring.  As of October 2018, APS has completed the statistical analyses for its CCR disposal units that triggered assessment\n22\nmonitoring.  APS determined that several of its CCR disposal units at Cholla and Four Corners will need to undergo corrective action.  In addition, under the current regulations, all such disposal units must have ceased operating and initiated closure by April 11, 2021, at the latest (except for those disposal units subject to alternative closure).  APS completed the assessments of corrective measures on June 14, 2019; however, additional investigations and engineering analyses that will support the remedy selection are still underway.  In addition, APS will also solicit input from the public and host public hearings as part of this process.  APS’s estimates for its share of corrective action and monitoring costs at Four Corners and Cholla are captured within the Asset Retirement Obligations in Note 11.\nAs APS continues to implement the CCR rule’s corrective action assessment process, the current cost estimates may change.  Given uncertainties that may exist until we have fully completed the corrective action assessment\nand final remedy selection\nprocess, APS cannot predict any ultimate impacts to the APS; however, at this time, APS does not believe\nthat any potential changes to the cost estimate for Four Corners or Cholla\nwould have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEffluent Limitation Guidelines\n.  Based on the most recently finalized effluent limitation guidelines (“ELG”), published by EPA on October 13, 2020, APS completed an NPDES permit modification for Four Corners on December 1, 2\n023.  The ELG standards finalized in October of 2020 relaxed the “zero discharge” standard for bottom ash transport waters EPA finalized in September of 2015.  Nonetheless, on March 29, 2023, EPA proposed again for the bottom ash transport water ELG to shift back to a “zero discharge” standard.  EPA anticipates finalizing these standards by spring or summer of 2024.  In the event these standards are finalized as proposed, a further modification to the Four Corners NPDES permit would be required.  We cannot at this time predict the outcome of this rulemaking nor whether future regulatory action by EPA would have impact\ns on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOzone National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\nOn October 1, 2015, EPA finalized revisions to the primary ground-level ozone NAAQS at a level of 70 parts per billion (“ppb”).  Further, on      December 23, 2020, EPA issued a final regulation retaining the current primary NAAQS for ozone, following a required scientific review process.  With ozone standards becoming more stringent, our fossil generation units will come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of NOx and volatile organic compounds, and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas.  EPA was expected to designate attainment and nonattainment areas relative to the new 70 ppb standard by October 1, 2017.   While EPA took action designating attainment and unclassifiable areas on November 6, 2017, the Agency’s final action designating non-attainment areas was not issued until April 30, 2018.  At that time, EPA designated the geographic areas containing Yuma and Phoenix, Arizona as in non-attainment with the 2015 70 ppb ozone NAAQS.  The vast majority of APS’s natural gas-fired EGUs are located in these jurisdictions.  Areas of Arizona and the Navajo Nation where the remainder of APS’s fossil-fuel fired EGU fleet is located were designated as in attainment.  We anticipate that revisions to the SIPs and FIPs implementing required controls to achieve the new 70 ppb standard will be in place between 2023 and 2024.  At this time, because proposed SIPs and FIPs implementing the revised ozone NAAQSs have yet to be released, APS is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on APS.  APS will continue to monitor these standards as they are implemented within the jurisdictions affecting APS.\nOn March 15, 2023, EPA issued its final Good Neighbor Plan for 23 states in order to ensure that the cross-state transport of ozone forming emissions does not interfere with downwind state compliance with the NAAQS.  Power plant emission limitations are a key aspect of these regulations, which involve emission allowance trading for nitrogen oxide emissions.  While Arizona was not among the 23 states subject to EPA’s March 2023 final action, EPA announced at this time that it was considering the inclusion of Arizona within a future regulatory action under the “good neighbor” provisions of the Clean Air Act.\n23\nAPS cannot at this time predict the outcome of future “good neighbor” rulemakings by EPA or the extent to which such regulations, if they are finalized, may impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSuperfund-Related Matters.\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil, water, or air.  Those who released, generated, transported to, or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among the parties who are potentially responsible (each a “PRP”).  PRPs may be strictly, jointly, and severally liable for clean-up.  On September 3, 2003, EPA advised APS that EPA considers APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52\nnd\nStreet Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (“OU3”) in Phoenix, Arizona.  APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site.  APS and Pinnacle West have agreed with EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within OU3.  In addition, on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study (“RI/FS”).  The RI/FS for OU3 was finalized and submitted to EPA at the end of 2022.  APS cannot predict the EPA’s timing with respect to this matter.  APS estimates that its cost related to this investigation and study is approximately $3 million.  APS anticipates incurring additional expenditures in the future, but because the ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized by EPA, at the present time, expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated.\nIn connection with APS’s status as a PRP for OU3, since 2013 APS and at least two dozen other parties have been defendants in various CERCLA lawsuits stemming from allegations that contamination from OU3 and elsewhere has impacted groundwater wells operated by the Roosevelt Irrigation District (“RID”).  At this time, only one active lawsuit remains pending, which is on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit based on a U.S. District Court order dismissing cost recovery claims of approximately\n$20.7 million by a service provider for RID.  APS is unable to predict the outcome of any further litigation related to this claim or APS’s share of liability related to that claim; however, APS does not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, as part of a state governmental investigation into groundwater contamination in this area, on January 25, 2015, the ADEQ sent a letter to APS seeking information concerning the degree to which, if any, APS’s current and former ownership of these facilities may have contributed to groundwater contamination in this area.  APS responded to ADEQ on May 4, 2015.  Since that time, ADEQ has taken no action based on the information provided by APS.\nOn February 28, 2022, EPA provided APS with a request for information under CERCLA related to APS’s Ocotillo power plant site located in Tempe, Arizona.  In particular, EPA seeks information from APS regarding APS’s use, storage, and disposal of substances containing per-and polyfluoroalkyl (“PFAS”) compounds at the Ocotillo power plant site in order to aid EPA’s investigation into actual or threatened releases of PFAS into groundwater within the South Indian Bend Wash (“SIBW”) Superfund site.  The SIBW Superfund site includes the APS Ocotillo power plant site.  APS filed its response to this information request on April 29, 2022.  On January 17, 2023, EPA contacted APS to inform APS that it would be commencing on-site investigations within the SIBW site, including the Ocotillo power plant, and performing a remedial investigation and feasibility study related to potential PFAS impacts to groundwater over the next two to three years.\nAPS estimates that its costs to oversee and participate in the remedial investigation work will be approximately $1.7 million.  At the present time, we are unable to predict the\n24\noutcome of this matter and any further expenditures related to necessary remediation, if any, or further investigations cannot be reasonably estimated.\nFour Corners National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit\nThe latest NPDES permit for Four Corners was issued on September 30, 2019.  Based upon a November 1, 2019 filing by several environmental groups, the Environmental Appeals Board (“EAB”) took up review of the Four Corners NPDES Permit.  The EAB denied the environmental group petition on     September 30, 2020.  While on January 22, 2021, the environmental groups filed a petition for review of the EAB’s decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the parties to the litigation (including APS) finalized a settlement on May 2, 2022.  This settlement requires investigation of thermal wastewater discharges from Four Corners, administratively closes the litigation filed in January of 2021, and APS does not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWater Supply\nBased on a declaration from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, as of January 1, 2024, Arizona’s supply of Colorado River water will be subject to a Tier 1 shortage.  This shortage will result in a reduction to Arizona’s share of the Colorado River water by 28 percent or 792,000-acre feet.  This reduction will largely be felt by central Arizona’s agricultural users, mainly in Pinal County.  In light of pre-existing mitigation measures at the state level, the Tier 1 shortage is not expected at this time to materially impact water supplies for customers in APS’s service territory, nor materially impact water supplies used by APS’s fleet of generation resources.  As drought conditions across the southwestern U.S. region continue to worsen, APS will monitor water availability necessary for continued Company operations and, as necessary, implement measures to mitigate risks associated with future Colorado River shortage declarations.\nAssured supplies of water are important for APS’s generating plants.  At the present time, APS has adequate water to meet its operating needs.  The Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is located, has historically experienced drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area.  APS is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect, if any, on future drought conditions that could have an impact on operations of its plants.\nConflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern United States have resulted in numerous court actions, which, in addition to future supply conditions, have the potential to impact APS’s operations.\nSan Juan River Adjudication.\nBoth groundwater and surface water in areas important to APS’s operations have been the subject of inquiries, claims, and legal proceedings, which will require a number of years to resolve.  APS is one of a number of parties in a proceeding, filed March 13, 1975, before the Eleventh Judicial District Court in New Mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for Four Corners is derived.  An agreement reached with the Navajo Nation in 1985, however, provides that if Four Corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication, the Navajo Nation will provide, for an agreed upon cost, sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss.  In addition, APS is a party to a water contract that allows the Company to secure water for Four Corners in the event of a water shortage and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement, which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to Four Corners in the event of a water shortage in the San Juan River Basin.\n25\nGila River Adjudication.\nA summons served on APS in early 1986 required all water claimants in the Lower Gila River Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or before January 20, 1987, in an action pending in Arizona Superior Court.  Palo Verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons.  APS’s rights and the rights of the other Palo Verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at Palo Verde are potentially at issue in this adjudication.  As operating agent of Palo Verde, APS filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the Palo Verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to Palo Verde.  Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights.  Several of APS’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons, including a number of gas-fired power plants located within Maricopa and Pinal Counties.  In November 1999, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and Indian tribes.  In addition, in September 2000, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims.  Litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court.  In December 2005, APS and other parties filed a petition with the Arizona Supreme Court requesting interlocutory review of a September 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights.  The Arizona Supreme Court denied the petition in May 2007, and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order.  No trial date concerning APS’s water rights claims has been set in this matter.\nAt this time, the lower court proceedings in the Gila River adjudication are in the process of determining the specific hydro-geologic testing protocols for determining which groundwater wells located outside of the subflow zone of the Gila River should be subject to the adjudication court’s jurisdiction.   A hearing to determine this jurisdictional test question was held in March 2018 in front of a special master, and a draft decision based on the evidence heard during that hearing was issued on May 17, 2018.  The decision of the special master, which was finalized on November 14, 2018, accepts the proposed hydro-geologic testing protocols supported by APS and other industrial users of groundwater.  A further ruling affirming this decision by the trial court judge overseeing the adjudication was issued on July 8, 2022.  Further proceedings have been initiated to determine the specific hydro-geologic testing protocols for subflow depletion determinations.  The determinations made in this final stage of the proceedings may ultimately govern the adjudication of rights for parties, such as APS, that rely on groundwater extraction to support their industrial operations.  APS cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\nLittle Colorado River Adjudication.\nAPS has filed claims to water in the Little Colorado River Watershed in Arizona in an action pending in the Apache County, Arizona, Superior Court, which was originally filed on September 5, 1985.  APS’s groundwater resource utilized at Cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and, therefore, is potentially at issue in the case.  APS’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights.  Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights.  No trial or pretrial proceedings have been scheduled for adjudication of APS’s water right claims.  The adjudication court is currently conducting a trial of federal reserved water right claims asserted by the Hopi Tribe and by the United States as trustee for the Tribe.  In addition, the adjudication court has established a schedule for consideration of separate federal reserved water right claims asserted by the Navajo Nation and by the United States as trustee for the Nation.  There is no established timeframe within which the adjudication court is expected to issue a final determination of water rights for the Hopi Tribe and the Navajo Nation, and any such final determination is likely to occur multiple years in the future.\nAlthough the above matters remain subject to further evaluation, APS does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n26\nHuman Capital\nThe Company seeks to attract the best employees, retain those employees, and create a safe, inclusive, and productive work environment for all employees.  We believe the strength of our employees is one of the significant contributors to our Company’s success.  Human capital measures and objectives that the Company focuses on in retaining its talent and managing its business include the safety of our employees, career development, diversity, equity and inclusion, succession planning, hiring, voluntary turnover, compensation, benefits, employee experience, and engagement.\nEmployee Safety\nOur work and our decisions are anchored in safety – safety is the foundation of everything we do, and employee safety is our paramount responsibility as an employer.  We develop safety practices and programs that ensure employees have safe and secure workplaces that allow them to perform at the highest levels.  We use preventative programs such as the APS Moves program to help our workforce stay healthy and prepare them to perform tasks safely.  Our comprehensive safety programs and our focus on human and organizational performance and injury case management contribute significantly to our strong safety performance.\nAs we continue to improve our safety performance, our ultimate goal remains serious injury reduction.  Our employees are expected to do the right thing and are empowered to speak up when there are better or safer ways of doing business, including stopping work to reassess or improve safety.\nSafety committees operate in organizations throughout the Company, providing opportunities for employees to positively impact their local safety cultures and performance.\nInclusion and Belonging\nWe believe that belonging matters.  When we feel seen, heard, and valued, we can more effectively unite behind the APS Promise.  Inclusion at the Company involves taking deliberate action to embrace the unique perspectives of each employee.  We recognize that diversity of demographics, backgrounds and cultural perspective is a key driver for our success.\nOur internal diversity, equity, and inclusion team, supported by our Executive Diversity & Inclusion Council as well as other groups, leads this commitment with an emphasis on diversity among employees, in the workplace, and through our community involvement, as well as an increased focus on attracting and retaining diverse talent.  This focus extends to individual business units in the Company, which report on the diversity of their teams during management review meetings to build awareness and address gaps of workforce diversity.\nOur efforts to support and empower employees include a commitment to full inclusion of all our people.  We have a robust, multi-year strategy for diversity, equity, and inclusion that focuses on eleven key areas, both internally- and externally-facing.  In 2021, APS received recognition as winner of the Inclusive Workplace Award from Diversity Leadership Alliance and Arizona Society of Human Resource Management.  The award recognizes APS as an Arizona corporation that leads by example, creating an inclusive environment in which employees can be their genuine, authentic selves, and partners on community outreach efforts and support.\nEach year since 2020, we have conducted company-wide executive listening sessions to provide employees with opportunities to be heard on their experiences at the Company.  In 2019, we signed the UNITY Pledge in support of full inclusion and equality in employment, housing, and public accommodations for all Arizonans, including gay and transgender people.  The UNITY Pledge reinforces our commitment to fostering an environment that recognizes our employees’ unique needs and celebrates\n27\nthe value of diverse perspectives.  The Company sponsors eleven employee network groups that are intended to create a sense of inclusion and belonging for employees.\nWe continue to focus on hiring diverse employees as well as hiring employees from our veteran community.  During 2023, 42% of external hires were ethnically or racially diverse, 35% were female and 8% were veterans.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2023, 35% of our employees are ethnically or racially diverse, 26% are female, and 14% are veterans.  Finally, as of December 31, 2023, 39% of the Company’s officers are female, and 18% are ethnically or racially diverse.\nSuccession Planning\nSuccession planning ensures that our Company is prepared to fill executive and other key leadership roles with capable, experienced employees who can lead us into the future with strong and sustainable performance.  We continually revisit and revise succession plans to make certain qualified individuals are in place to move into critical positions.  In addition, we provide each business unit of the Company with talent management strategies and development plans to meet its future leadership needs.  Effective succession planning helps us identify employees with leadership potential, evaluate any gaps in education, skills and experience, and support employees in preparation for their next leadership roles.  Officers and directors review succession plans, leadership opportunities, and retirement projections to ensure business continuity.\nTalent Strategy and Development\nWe place significant focus on attracting and developing a skilled workforce.  To attract and retain top talent, we provide formal professional development programs through blended learning education and leadership training.\nOur employees have access to a wide variety of training and development opportunities, including leadership academies, rotational programs, mentoring programs, industry certifications, and loaned executive programs.  In 2023, we graduated 152 individuals from our three academies (Leadership Academy, Impact and Influence Academy, and Strategic Leadership Academy).\nTalent pipelines help sustain our skilled workforce needs.  Our pipeline strategy is driven by a robust portfolio of programs aimed at attracting early and mid-career talent.  With over a dozen programs in effect, our talent pipelines include craft apprenticeships and engineering, rotational, and internship programs.  We partner closely with specific colleges and universities, vocational schools, and organizations serving local communities to attract a large pool of qualified, diverse talent.  Additionally, 2023 marked the launch of the Department of Defense SkillBridge program, which provides APS early access to transitioning military talent to fill open roles.\nDuring 2023, we hosted 57 summer interns with an overall diversity rate of 67% and also comprised of 35% women.  In addition to our summer program, 14 participated as Maintenance Interns, Radiation Protection Interns, and Pre-Apprentice Interns (programs specifically offered at Palo Verde).\nTotal Rewards Strategy\nIn addition to our talent strategy, we place significant focus on our Total Rewards strategy for attracting, developing, and rewarding our highly skilled workforce.  Our employees are important to the success and future of our organization and our customers’ experiences.  At the Company, our pay and benefits, along with retirement, recognition, time off, career development and well-being, make up our Total Rewards program.  It is an important part of the employee experience at the Company and supports\n28\npersonal well-being and professional satisfaction.  We are committed to providing programs that matter to our employees throughout various life and career phases.\nEmployee Engagement\nAn annual employee experience survey and focused quarterly pulse-surveys, enable us to gather employee feedback, identify opportunities for improvement, and compare our performance to other companies.\nThrough the surveys, we track our Employee Experience Index, a set of seven questions that encompass key elements of a positive employee experience, including recognition, career development possibilities, and pride in the organization.\nBased on survey results, business units and individual managers are encouraged to take meaningful actions to improve the employee experience.  In response to past surveys, we have launched enterprise-wide initiatives focused on improving communication between employees and management as well as removing obstacles that prevent job success.  Other initiatives driven by the survey have given employees more access to leadership and improved meeting efficiency.  Our cross-functional Employee Engagement Council focuses on improving employee recognition across the organization.\nWe work to ensure that a positive work environment is maintained for all employees.  Through an outreach initiative, we obtain feedback from new hires regarding their employee experience.\n29\nCompany Culture\nIn 2020, the Company launched the APS Promise, anchoring our commitment to our customers, community, and each other.  The Promise explains our purpose, vision, and mission and the principles and behaviors that will empower us to achieve our strategic goals.  It represents the opportunity to build on our cultural strengths and develop new behaviors to enable our future success.  The APS Promise continues to be reinforced and integrated throughout our Company programs and messaging.\n30\nBUSINESS OF OTHER SUBSIDIARIES\nPNW Power\nOn August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of our equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary, BCE, to Ameresco (the “BCE Sale”).  The transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business and closed in multiple stages.  Certain investments and assets that BCE previously held, including the TransCanyon joint venture and holdings in the two Tenaska wind farm investments, were not included in the BCE Sale and were instead transferred to Pinnacle West Power, LLC (“PNW Power”), a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West.\nPNW Power’s investments include TransCanyon, a 50/50 joint venture that was formed in 2014 with BHE U.S. Transmission LLC, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  TransCanyon is pursuing independent electric transmission opportunities within the 11 U.S. states that comprise the Western Interconnection, excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be provided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners’ utility affiliates.\nPNW Power’s investments also include minority ownership positions in two wind farms operated by Tenaska Energy, Inc. and Tenaska Energy Holdings, LLC, the 242 MW Clear Creek and the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind farms.  Clear Creek achieved commercial operation in May 2020; however, in the fourth quarter of 2022 PNW Power’s equity method investment was fully impaired.  Nobles 2 achieved commercial operation in December 2020.  Both wind farms deliver power under long-term PPAs.  PNW Power indirectly owns 9.9% of Clear Creek and 5.1% of Nobles 2.\nEl Dorado\nEl Dorado is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West.  El Dorado owns debt investments and minority interests in several energy-related investments and Arizona community-based ventures.  In particular, El Dorado has committed to the following:\n•\n$25 million investment in the Energy Impact Partners fund, of which $16.7 million  has been funded as of December 31, 2023. Energy Impact Partners is an organization that focuses on fostering innovation and supporting the transformation of the utility industry.\n•\n$25 million investment in AZ-VC (formerly invisionAZ Fund), of which $6.3 million has been funded as of December 31, 2023.  AZ-VC is a fund focused on analyzing, investing, managing, and otherwise dealing with investments in privately-held early stage and emerging growth technology companies and businesses primarily based in Arizona, or based in other jurisdictions and having existing or potential strategic or economic ties to companies or other interests in Arizona.\nThe remainder of these investment commitments will be contributed by El Dorado as each investment fund selects and makes investments.\n31\nPinnacle West, APS and El Dorado are all incorporated in the State of Arizona.  PNW Power is incorporated in Delaware.  Additional information for each of these companies is provided below:\n(a)    See Note 20 for information related to the sale of Bright Canyon Energy.\nThe APS number includes employees at jointly-owned generating facilities (approximately 2,200 employees) for which APS serves as the generating facility manager.  Approximately 1,150 APS employees are union employees, represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”).  On September 25, 2023, the IBEW membership ratified a new collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with APS.  The new CBA became effective in October 2023.  This new contract has a duration of three years and becomes amendable on April 1, 2026.\nWHERE TO FIND MORE INFORMATION\nWe use our website (\nwww.pinnaclewest.com\n) as a channel of distribution for material Company information.  The following filings are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”):  Annual Reports on Form 10-K, definitive proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports.

    "text": "In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report, set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results.  Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the following risks and uncertainties apply to Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries, including APS.\nREGULATORY RISKS\nOur financial condition depends upon APS’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy.\nAPS is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business, liquidity and results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner.  The ACC regulates APS’s retail electric rates and FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services.  The profitability of APS is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates and adjustor recovery mechanisms.  Consequently, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any APS rate proceedings, adjustor recovery and ancillary matters which may come before the ACC and FERC, including in some cases how court challenges to these regulatory decisions are resolved.  Arizona, like certain other states, has a statute that allows the ACC to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances.  Additionally, given that APS is subject to oversight by several regulatory agencies, a resolution by one may not foreclose potential actions by others for similar or related matters.  See Note 10.\nThe ACC must also approve APS’s issuance of equity and debt securities and any significant transfer or encumbrance of APS property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us, APS, and our respective affiliates, including the infusion of equity into APS.  Decisions made by the ACC or FERC could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAPS’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid negative operational and financial impacts depends in part upon compliance with federal, state and local laws, judicial decisions, statutes, regulations and ACC requirements, which may be revised from time to time by legislative or other action, and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits, approvals, and certificates.\nAPS must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes, regulations, rules, tariffs, and orders of agencies that regulate APS’s business, including FERC, NRC, EPA, the ACC, and state and local governmental agencies.  These agencies regulate many aspects of APS’s utility operations, including safety and performance, emissions, siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that APS can charge retail and wholesale customers.  Failure to comply can subject APS to, among other things, fines and penalties.  For example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC can impose penalties (approximately $1.2 million per day per violation) for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards.  APS is also required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from these agencies.  APS believes the necessary permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that APS’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects.\nChanges in laws or regulations that govern APS, new interpretations of laws and regulations, or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the manner in which we operate our business and our results of operations.  In particular, new or revised laws or interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impact or call into question the ACC’s permissive regulatory authority, which may result in uncertainty as to jurisdictional authority within our state, and uncertainty as to whether\n33\nACC decisions will be binding or challenged by other agencies or bodies asserting jurisdiction.  In November 2021, the Arizona Court of Appeals issued an opinion that called into question the ACC-approved limitation of liability provision found in the APS Service Schedules.  APS sought review of the decision at the Arizona Supreme Court, which was denied; however, the Supreme Court depublished portions of the Court of Appeals’ decision.  APS is seeking revised tariff language to mitigate potential adverse impacts on APS’s future, potential litigation exposure which may result from this court decision.  We are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from any pending or future regulatory or legislative rulemaking.\nThe operation of APS’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures.\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose safety-related, security-related and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities.  Events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the NRC to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generating facilities, including Palo Verde.  In the event of noncompliance with its requirements, the NRC has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut-down of a unit or civil penalties, or both, depending upon the NRC’s assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  The increased costs resulting from penalties, a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with NRC requirements may adversely affect APS’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAPS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, and changes in, or liabilities under, existing or new laws or regulations may increase APS’s cost of operations or impact its business plans.\nAPS is, or may become, subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations, including air emissions of conventional pollutants and GHGs, water quality, discharges of wastewater and waste streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities, solid waste, hazardous waste, and coal combustion products, which consist of bottom ash, fly ash, and air pollution control wastes.  These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating, and other costs, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations.  These laws and regulations generally require APS to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals.  If there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval, or if APS fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses.  In addition, failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties.  Both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations.  APS cannot predict the outcome (financial or operational) of any related litigation that may arise.\nEnvironmental Clean Up.\nAPS has been named as a PRP\nfor Superfund sites in Phoenix, Arizona, and it could be named a PRP in the future for other environmental clean-up at sites identified by a regulatory body.  APS cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all PRPs.\nCoal Ash.\nIn December 2014, the EPA issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of CCR, which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of, among other things, fly ash and bottom ash.  The rule regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste.  APS currently disposes of CCR in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Cholla and Four Corners.  To the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of these CCR units, modification or changes to the manner of closure of such units, or the\n34\nconstruction of new CCR units beyond what we currently anticipate, APS would incur significant additional costs for CCR disposal.  In addition, the rule may also require corrective action to address releases from CCR disposal units or the presence of CCR constituents within groundwater near CCR disposal units above certain regulatory thresholds.\nOzone National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized revisions to the NAAQS for ozone, which set new, more stringent standards on emissions of nitrogen oxide, a precursor to ozone, in an effort to protect human health and human welfare.  Depending on the final attainment designations for the new standards and the state implementation requirements, APS may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas.  In addition, the EPA may in the future further increase the stringency of various NAAQS, including for ozone or other pollutants, such as particulate matter.  With regard to even more stringent NAAQS requirements, additional control measures and compliance costs may become necessary for APS as well as its current and potential future customers.\nAPS cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs incurred by APS are not fully recoverable from APS’s customers, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  Due to current or potential future regulations or legislation coupled with trends in natural gas and coal prices, or other clean energy rules or initiatives, the economics or feasibility of continuing to own certain resources, particularly coal facilities, may deteriorate, warranting early retirement of those plants, which may result in asset impairments.  APS would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery.  Such regulations may also act as a deterrent to future customer growth or create additional costs for existing customers, potentially slowing APS’s customer growth.\nAPS faces potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, as well as physical and operational risks related to climate effects.\nConcern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit CO\n2\n, which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel, and other GHG emissions.\nPotential Financial Risks — Greenhouse Gas Regulation, the Clean Power Plan and Potential Litigation.\nFollowing a U.S. Supreme Court decision on June 30, 2022, which substantially narrowed EPA’s authority to regulate power plant GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, on May 23, 2023, EPA proposed new GHG emission standards for power plants.  In contrast to measures finalized in 2015, EPA’s May 2023 proposal is focused on limiting power plant GHG emissions through control mechanisms that can be implemented at individual power plant facilities.  These mechanisms would include carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen co-firing, natural gas co-firing, and limits on facility output, among other measures.  EPA expects to take final action on this proposal in the spring or summer of 2024.\nDepending on the outcome of future carbon emission rulemaking under the Clean Air Act targeting new and existing power plants, the utility industry may become subject to more stringent and expansive regulations.  Depending on the means of compliance with federal emission performance standards, the electric utility industry may be forced to incur substantial costs necessary to achieve compliance.  In addition, we anticipate that such regulations will be challenged in federal court prior to their implementation.  Depending on the outcome of such judicial review, the utility industry may face alternative efforts from private parties seeking to establish alternative GHG emission limitations from power plants.  Alternative GHG emission limitations may arise from litigation under either federal or state\n35\ncommon laws or citizen suit provisions of federal environmental statutes that attempt to force federal agency rulemaking or impose direct facility emission limitations.  Such lawsuits may also seek damages from harm alleged to have resulted from power plant GHG emissions.\nPhysical and Operational Risks.\nWeather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwestern United States’ desert area, and these are risks that APS considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system.  Large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and may represent a greater challenge.  Limitations on water supplies necessary to operate electric generation infrastructure could arise from prolonged drought and shortage declarations associated with key surface water resources.  As part of conducting its business, APS recognizes that the southwestern United States is particularly susceptible to the risks posed by climate change, which over time is projected to exacerbate high temperature extremes and prolong drought in the area where APS conducts its business.\nCo-owners of our jointly owned generation and transmission facilities may have unaligned goals and positions due to the effects of legislation, regulations, economic conditions, or changes in our industry, which could have a significant impact on our ability to continue operations of such facilities.\nAPS owns certain of its power plants and transmission facilities jointly with other owners, with varying ownership interests in such facilities.  Changes in the nature of our industry and the economic viability of certain plants and facilities, including impacts resulting from types and availability of other resources, fuel costs, legislation, and regulation, together with timing considerations related to the expiration of leases or other agreements for such facilities, could result in unaligned positions among co-owners.  Differences in the co-owners’ willingness or ability to continue their participation could lead to the eventual shut down of units or facilities and uncertainty related to the resulting cost recovery of such assets.  See Note 3 for a discussion of the Navajo Plant and Cholla retirement and the related risks associated with APS’s continued recovery of its remaining investment in the plant.\nDeregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition, which could have a significant adverse impact on APS’s business and its results of operations.\nIn 1999, the ACC approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona.  Retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on APS due to an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital.  Although some very limited retail competition existed in APS’s service area in 1999 and 2000, there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to APS’s customers.  This is in large part due to a 2004 Arizona Court of Appeals decision that found critical components of the ACC’s rules to be violative of the Arizona Constitution.  The ruling also voided the operating authority of all the competitive providers previously authorized by the ACC.  On May 9, 2013, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona.  The ACC subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state.  One of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market, including setting utility rates on a “market” basis, would be consistent with the requirements of the Arizona Constitution.  On September 11, 2013, after receiving legal advice from the ACC staff, the ACC voted 4-1 to close the current docket and await full Arizona Constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter.\nIn November 2018, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona.  On July 1 and July 2, 2019, ACC Staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules.  On February 10, 2020, two ACC Commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules.  On February 12, 2020, ACC Staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric\n36\ncompetition rules.  During a July 15, 2020, ACC Staff meeting, the ACC Commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program, but no action was taken.  The ACC continues to discuss matters related to retail electric competition, including the potential for additional buy-through programs or other pilot programs.  In April 2022, the Arizona Legislature passed and the Governor signed a bill that repealed the electric deregulation law that had been in place in Arizona since 1998.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nAPS’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity.\nWeather Conditions.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities.  Electric power demand is generally a seasonal business.  In Arizona, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  As a result, APS’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, APS has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  As a result, unusually mild weather could diminish APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nApart from the impact on electricity demand, weather conditions related to prolonged high temperatures or extreme heat events present operational challenges.  In the southwestern United States, where APS conducts its business, the effects of climate change are projected to increase the overall average temperature, lead to more extreme temperature events, and exacerbate prolonged drought conditions leading to the declining availability of water resources.  Extreme heat events and rising temperatures are projected to reduce the generation capacity of thermal-power plants and decrease the efficiency of the transmission grid.  These operational risks related to rising temperatures and extreme heat events could affect APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nHigher temperatures may decrease the snowpack, which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires.  Forest fires could threaten APS’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities.  Any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  In addition, the decrease in snowpack can also lead to reduced water supplies in the areas where APS relies upon non-renewable water resources to supply cooling and process water for electricity generation.  Prolonged and extreme drought conditions can also affect APS’s long-term ability to access the water resources necessary for thermal electricity generation operations.  Reductions in the availability of water for power plant cooling could negatively impact APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEffects of Energy Conservation Measures and Distributed Energy Resources.\nAPS customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demand-side management efforts, which in turn impact the demand for electricity.  APS must also meet certain distributed renewable energy requirements.  A portion of APS’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed renewable energy resources (generally, small-scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties).  The distributed renewable energy requirement is 30% of the applicable RES requirement for 2012 and subsequent years (this requirement has been waived by the ACC for 2023).  Customer participation in distributed renewable energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some of their own energy needs.\nIn addition to these rules and requirements, energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources continue to evolve, which may have similar impacts on the demand for electricity.  Reduced demand due to these energy efficiency requirements, distributed energy requirements and other emerging technologies, unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms, could have a material adverse impact on APS’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n37\nActual and Projected Customer and Sales Growth.\nRetail customers in APS’s service territory increased 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with the prior-year period.  For the three years through 2023, APS’s customer growth averaged 2.1% per year.  We currently project annual customer growth to be 1.5% to 2.5% for 2024 and the average annual growth to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% through 2026 based on anticipated steady population growth in Arizona during that period.\nRetail electricity sales in kWh, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, increased 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with the prior-year period.  While steady customer growth was somewhat offset by weaker usage among residential customers, energy savings driven by customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, the main drivers of positive sales for this period were continued strong sales to commercial and industrial customers and the ramp-up of new data center customers.\nFor the three years through 2023, annual retail electricity sales growth averaged 2.7%, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations.  Due to the expected growth of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kWh will increase in the range of 2.0% to 4.0% for 2024 and that average annual growth will be in the range of 4.0% to 6.0% through 2026, including the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, but excluding the effects of weather variations.  These projected sales growth ranges include the impacts of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, which are expected to contribute to 2024 growth in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% and to average annual growth in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2026.\nLonger term, APS has been preparing for and can serve significant load growth from residential and business customers.  On top of these existing growth trends, APS is also now receiving unprecedented incremental requests for service from extra-large commercial energy users (over 25 MW) with very high energy demands that persist virtually around-the-clock.  These incremental requests for service by extra-large energy users far exceed available generation and transmission resource capacity in the Southwest region for the foreseeable future.  In April 2023, APS notified prospective extra-large customers without existing commitments from APS that it is not able to commit at this time to their future extra-large projects (over 25 MW).  Because of the high growth in demand for such projects, APS has developed a prioritization queue that identifies and prioritizes projects while maintaining system reliability and affordability for existing APS customers.  APS is exploring available options for securing sufficient electric generation and transmission to meet these projections of future customer needs.\nActual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and energy conservation, slower ramp-up of and/or fewer data centers and large manufacturing facilities, slower than expected commercial and industrial expansions, impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in DG, responses to retail price changes,  changes in regulatory standards, and impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations.  Based on past experience, a 1% variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $20 million, and a 1% variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $5 million.\nThe operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages or could otherwise significantly impact APS’s results of operations\n.\nThe operation of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks, including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel interruption, and performance below expected\n38\nlevels of output or efficiency.  Unscheduled outages, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of APS’s business.  Because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid, and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others.  Concerns over the physical security of these assets could include damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts that could lead to outages or other adverse effects.  If APS’s facilities operate below expectations, especially during its peak seasons, it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses, including increased purchased power expenses.\nAdditionally, as APS’s transmission infrastructure ages and its transmission system needs grow to support growth in our territory and in the Southwest, it will need to replace and expand certain portions of its transmission infrastructure, which requires significant investment of capital.  Risks related to the timely completion of and costs associated with these projects may be exacerbated by a constrained supply chain limiting the availability of necessary parts and materials as well as APS’s use, in some cases, of older, obsolete, or unsupported equipment.  Certain replacements and expansions of the transmission infrastructure will also require the acquisition or renewal of land leases, easements, or other rights-of-way that may require approvals from landowners, including individuals, governmental agencies, and, at times, tribal nations.  APS is unable to predict the outcomes of any pending or future required approvals, including any related costs, which could be significant.  If APS is unable to successfully manage the replacement and expansion of its transmission infrastructure, it could face increased equipment failures, power quality challenges, reputational impact, and financial loss.\nThe impact of wildfires could negatively affect APS’s results of operations.\nWildfires have the potential to affect communities within APS’s service territory and the surrounding areas, as well as APS’s vast network of electric transmission and distribution lines and facilities.  The potential likelihood of wildfires has increased due to many of the same weather and climate change impacts existing in Arizona as those that led to catastrophic wildfires in California.  The continued expansion of the wildland urban interface has also increased wildfire risk to surrounding communities.  APS currently intends to implement a public safety power shutoff (“PSPS”) program in addition to its current fire mitigation efforts.  While such technology is intended to mitigate fire risk, it also introduces additional risks to APS and its customers, such as claims for damages, and the timing and effectiveness of such fire mitigation efforts may be insufficient to prevent wildfires in APS’s expansive service territory and surrounding areas.  APS could be held liable for damages incurred as a result of wildfires regardless of fault and may not be able to recover all or a substantial portion of any such damages or costs from insurance or through rates.  In addition, we could also experience credit rating downgrades, reputational harm, volatility in the market for our common stock, and significant financial distress upon the occurrence of a wildfire event.  Furthermore, any damage caused to our assets, loss of service to our customers, or liability imposed as a result of wildfires could negatively impact APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe inability to successfully develop, acquire or operate generation resources to meet future resource needs and load forecasts in accordance with reliability requirements and other new or evolving standards and regulations could adversely impact our business.\nPotential changes in regulatory standards, impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our current and future generation portfolio.  The current regulatory standards, laws, and regulations create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix.  In addition, APS is required by the ACC to meet certain energy resource portfolio\n39\nrequirements, including those related to renewables development and energy efficiency measures, in addition to specific competitive resource procurement requirements.  The development and operation of any generation facility is also subject to many risks, including those related to financing, siting, permitting, new and evolving technology, extreme weather events, workforce issues, cybersecurity attacks, supply chain constraints for critical spare parts, and the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities among others.  APS needs to develop or acquire new generation facilities, potentially modernize existing facilities, and/or contract for additional capacity in order to meet future resource needs and load forecasts.  APS’s inability to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn expressing concerns about the environmental and climate-related impacts from continued extraction, transportation, delivery and combustion of fossil fuels, environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting, construction, and operation of fossil fuel infrastructure projects.  These efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables, including the future course of Federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities.  APS cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop, construct, and operate fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the future.\nIn January 2020, APS announced its goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity by 2050 with an intermediate 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy.  APS’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment is dependent upon a number of external factors, some of which include supportive national and state energy policies, a supportive regulatory environment, sales and customer growth, the development, deployment and advancement of clean energy technologies, adequate supply chain for generation resources, and continued access to capital markets.\nThe lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on APS’s business and results of operations.\nAssured supplies of water are important for APS’s generating plants.  Water in the southwestern United States is limited, and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supplies of water.  Both groundwater and surface water in areas important to the operation of APS’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings.  In addition, the region in which APS’s power plants are located suffers from prolonged drought conditions, which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies.  Climate change is also projected to exacerbate such drought conditions.  In addition, Colorado River water supplies for Arizona are subject to a Tier 1 shortage declaration, which substantially limits the quantity of water available for the state.  APS’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water, along with that of its customers, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks\nand risks of unauthorized access to our systems that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  In the regular course of our business, we handle a range of sensitive security, customer, and business systems information.  There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication, and maturity of threat actors, including from both nation-state and non-nation state actors, that seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric utility industry and wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system, our information technology systems, generation (including our Palo Verde nuclear facility), transmission and distribution facilities, and other infrastructure facilities and\n40\nsystems and physical assets.  We have been and could be the target of attacks, and the aforementioned systems are critical areas of cyber protection for us.\nWe rely extensively on IT systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms.  Some of these systems are managed, hosted, provided, or used by third parties to assist in conducting our business.  Malicious actors may attack vendors to disrupt the services these vendors provide to us or to use those vendors as a cyber conduit to attack us.  As more third parties are involved in the operation of our business, there is a risk the confidentiality, integrity, privacy, or security of data held by, or accessible to, third parties may be compromised.\nIf a significant cybersecurity event or breach were to occur, we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and we could (i) experience property damage, disruptions to our business, theft of or unauthorized access to customer, employee, financial or system operation information or other information; (ii) experience loss of revenue or incur significant costs for repair, remediation and breach notification, and increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security measures; and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage.  If such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly, their effects could be compounded or could delay our response or the effectiveness of our response and ability to limit our exposure to potential liability.  These types of events would also require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cybersecurity incidents which require significant investment, maintenance, and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change.  These systems and processes may be insufficient to mitigate the possibility of cybersecurity incidents, malicious social engineering, fraudulent or other malicious activities, and human error or malfeasance in the safeguarding of our data.\nWe are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security, customer information and business information.  One of these agencies, NERC, has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems, and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply.  The NRC also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at commercial nuclear power plants.  The increasing promulgation of NERC and NRC rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards.  Experiencing a cybersecurity incident could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as those promulgated by NERC and the NRC, privacy laws, or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties.\nThe risk of these system-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify.  We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and attempted intrusions to our information technology systems and we could experience such threats and attempted intrusions to our operational control systems.  To date, we do not believe we have experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our service operations.  We may not be able to anticipate and prevent all cyberattacks or information security breaches, and our ongoing investments in security resources, talent, and business practices may not be effective against all threat actors.\nWe maintain cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems, but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach.  Coverage for cybersecurity events continues to evolve as the industry matures.  In the future, adequate insurance may not\n41\nbe available at rates that we believe are reasonable, and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.\nThere are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities, such as environmental, health, fuel supply, spent fuel disposal, regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAPS has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants, Palo Verde, which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the United States.  Palo Verde constitutes approximately 18% of APS’s owned and leased generation capacity.  Palo Verde is subject to environmental, health and financial risks, such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel; the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel; the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning; potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities; the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks; and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems.  APS maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage.  APS may be required under federal law to pay up to $144.9 million (but not more than $21.6 million per year) of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident not only at Palo Verde, but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.  In addition, APS is subject to retrospective premium adjustments under its nuclear property insurance policies with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (“NEIL”) for approximately $22.4 million if NEIL’s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds and if the retrospective premium assessment is declared by NEIL’s Board of Directors.  Although APS has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at Palo Verde, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures and/or increase operating costs.\nChanges in technology could create challenges for APS’s existing business.\nAlternative energy technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions are being developed and commercialized, including renewable technologies such as photovoltaic (solar) cells, customer-sited generation, energy storage (batteries) and efficiency technologies.  Advances in technology and equipment/appliance efficiency could reduce the demand for supply from conventional generation, including carbon-free nuclear generation, and increase the complexity of managing APS’s information technology and power system operations, which could adversely affect APS’s business.\nCustomer-sited alternative energy technologies present challenges to APS’s operations due to misalignment with APS’s existing operational needs.  When these resources lack “dispatchability” and other elements of utility-side control, they are considered “unmanaged” resources.  The cumulative effect of such unmanaged resources results in added complexity for APS’s system management.\nAPS continues to pursue and implement advanced grid technologies, including transmission and distribution system technologies and digital meters enabling two-way communications between the utility and its customers.  Many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies, including energy storage technologies, have not yet been widely used or tested on a long-term basis, and their use on large-scale systems is not as established or mature as APS’s existing technologies and equipment.  The implementation of new and additional technologies adds complexity to our information technology and operational technology systems, which could require additional infrastructure and resources.  Widespread installation and acceptance of new technologies could also enable the entry of new market participants, such as technology companies, into the interface between APS and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on APS’s traditional business model.\n42\nDeployment of renewable energy technologies is expected to continue across the western states and result in a larger portion of the overall energy production coming from these sources.  These trends, which have benefited from historical and continuing government support for certain technologies, have the potential to put downward pressure on wholesale power prices throughout the western states which could make APS’s existing generating facilities less economical and impact their operational patterns and long-term viability.\nWe are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nLike many companies in the electric utility industry, our workforce is maturing, with approximately 28% of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2028.  Although we have undertaken efforts to recruit, train and develop new employees, we face increased competition for talent.  We are subject to other employee workforce factors, such as the availability and retention of qualified personnel and the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees.  These or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nA downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur current ratings are set forth in “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Credit Ratings” in Item 7.  We cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant.  Any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s and APS’s securities, limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs, which would adversely impact our financial results.  We could be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease.  In addition, borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings.  A downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties.  If our short-term ratings were to be lowered, it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market.  We note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nInvestment performance, changing interest rates, new rules or regulations and other economic, social, and political factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets, nuclear decommissioning trust funds and other special use funds or increase the valuation of our related obligations, resulting in significant additional funding requirements.  We are also subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and healthcare reform legislation.  Any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees, and legal obligations to fund our pension trust and nuclear decommissioning trusts for Palo Verde.  We hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise.  Declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements for the related trusts.  Additionally, the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate, which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.  Changes in interest rates impact the discount rate and valuation of the plan liabilities, and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs, cash contributions, regulatory assets, and charges to OCI.  Changes in demographics, including increased number of retirements or\n43\nchanges in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions, may also result in similar impacts.  The minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation and related regulations.  Increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans, resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise, could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe recover most of the pension and other postretirement benefit expense and all of the currently estimated nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates.  Any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nPending or future federal or state legislative or regulatory activity or court proceedings could increase the costs of providing medical insurance for our employees and retirees.  Any potential changes and resulting cost impacts cannot be determined with certainty at this time.\nOur cash flow depends on the performance of APS and its ability to make distributions.\nWe derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS.  Accordingly, our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of APS and its distributions to us.  APS is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us.\nAPS’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends, make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us.  In addition, an ACC financing order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40% and does not allow APS to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold.  The common equity ratio, as defined in the ACC order, is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt.\nPinnacle West’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries.\nBecause Pinnacle West is structured as a holding company, all existing and future debt and other liabilities of its subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to its own debt securities.  The assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available, in the first instance, to service their own debt and other obligations.  Our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows, particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries, would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied.\nThe use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations.\nAPS’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices.  APS is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas, and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist.  We have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives, including exchange traded futures and over-the-counter (“OTC”) forwards, options, and swaps.  As part of our overall risk management program, we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity.  To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies, which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations.\n44\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the over-the-counter derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation.  The Dodd-Frank Act could restrict, among other things, trading positions in the energy futures markets, require different collateral or settlement positions, or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions.  Based on the provisions included in the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementation of regulations, these changes could, among other things, impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs.\nWe are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties.  We use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties.  Despite the fact that the majority of APS’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default, which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period.\nGENERAL RISKS\nProposals to change policy in Arizona or other states made through ballot initiatives or referenda may increase the Company’s cost of operations or impact its business plans.\nIn Arizona and other states, a person or organization may file a ballot initiative or referendum with the Arizona Secretary of State or other applicable state agency and, if a sufficient number of verifiable signatures are presented, the initiative or referendum may be placed on the ballot for the public to vote on the matter.  Ballot initiatives and referenda may relate to any matter, including policy and regulation related to the electric industry, and may change statutes or the state constitution in ways that could impact Arizona utility customers, the Arizona economy, and the Company.  Some ballot initiatives and referenda are drafted in an unclear manner and their potential industry and economic impact can be subject to varied and conflicting interpretations.  We may oppose certain initiatives or referenda (including those that could result in negative impacts to our customers, the state, or the Company) via the electoral process, litigation, traditional legislative mechanisms, agency rulemaking or otherwise, which could result in significant costs to the Company.  The passage of certain initiatives or referenda could result in laws and regulations that impact our business plans and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nGeneral economic conditions could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGeneral economic factors that are beyond the Company’s control impact the Company’s forecasts and actual performance.  These factors include interest rates; recession; inflation; stagflation; deflation; supply chain constraints; unemployment trends; sanctions, trade restrictions, military interventions and the threat or possibility of war; terrorism or other global or national unrest; and political or financial instability. In particular, from 2021 to 2023, the United States’ economy has experienced a substantial rise in the inflation rate.  There is increased uncertainty as to whether the rise in inflation will continue and for how long.  Increases in inflation raise the Company’s costs for commodities, labor, materials and services. Additionally, global supply chains have been impacted, resulting in equipment delays and increased costs.  A failure to recover the increased costs caused by increased inflation and supply chain constraints through our rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n45\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n•\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n•\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, and investors;\n•\nchanges in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n•\ndevelopments generally affecting industries in which we operate;\n•\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n•\nannouncements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n•\nfavorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments;\n•\nour dividend policy;\n•\nchange in our management;\n•\nfuture sales by the Company of equity or equity-linked securities; and\n•\ngeneral domestic and international economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company.  These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFinancial market disruptions or new rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to various financial markets, which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy.\nPinnacle West and APS rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations.  We believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets.  However, certain market disruptions or revisions to rules or regulations may cause our cost of borrowing to increase generally, and/or otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets.\nIn addition, the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied or continued beyond current commitment periods for a variety of reasons, including new rules and regulations, changes to the internal policies of our lenders, periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders or financial markets, which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources and/or the cost of maintaining these sources.\nChanges in economic conditions, monetary policy, fiscal policy, financial regulation, rating agency treatment and/or other factors could result in higher interest rates, which would increase interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future, and thus increase the cost and/or reduce the amount of funds available to us for our current plans.\n46\nAdditionally, an increase in our leverage, whether as a result of these factors or otherwise, could adversely affect us by:\n•\ncausing a downgrade of our credit ratings;\n•\nincreasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing;\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate an increased portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce funds available to us for operations, future investment in our business or other purposes.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of Arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts.\nThese provisions, which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium, include the following:\n•\nrestrictions on our ability to engage in a wide range of “business combination” transactions with an “interested shareholder” (generally, any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of our outstanding voting power, or any of our affiliates or associates who beneficially owned 10% or more of our outstanding voting power at any time during the prior three years) or any affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder, unless specific conditions are met;\n•\nanti-greenmail provisions of Arizona law and our bylaws that prohibit us from purchasing shares of our voting stock from beneficial owners of more than 5% of our outstanding shares unless specified conditions are satisfied;\n•\nthe ability of the Board of Directors to increase the size of and fill vacancies on the Board of Directors, whether resulting from such increase, or from death, resignation, disqualification or otherwise;\n•\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and, with respect to preferred stock, the other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without shareholder approval;\n•\nrestrictions that limit the rights of our shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders; and\n•\nrestrictions regarding the rights of our shareholders to nominate directors or to submit proposals to be considered at shareholder meetings.\nWhile these provisions may have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable the Board of Directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors."

    "text": "The Company prioritizes and maintains a high level of commitment to responsible and secure cybersecurity practices given the critical nature of its services and the potential consequences of a successful cyber-attack on the Company and the electric grid.  A successful cyber-attack could have far-reaching consequences, from compromising the integrity of sensitive data to disrupting power supply.  To that end, the Company implements a robust risk management, strategy, and governance regime aimed at ensuring effective controls are in place to identify, mitigate, remediate, and communicate cyber threats at appropriate levels within the organization.\nAPS’s cybersecurity group (the “Cybersecurity Group”) is comprised of cybersecurity analysts, engineers, architects, and others, led by the Director of Cybersecurity, who reports to APS’s Vice President, Operations Support.  The Director of Cybersecurity has more than twenty years of experience in information technology and cybersecurity roles, with more than ten of those years at the Company.  The Director of Cybersecurity also holds cybersecurity certifications from multiple certifying bodies and is active in utility cybersecurity professional organizations.  The Cybersecurity Group has day-to-day responsibility for safeguarding the Company’s critical assets and assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.\nIn fulfilling its responsibility, the Cybersecurity Group manages formal documented internal processes such as risk management and vulnerability scanning, as well as other processes, such as assessing threat intelligence, that include outside partners.  Intelligence sharing comes from industry sources such as the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, government sources, as well as commercially purchased information sources.  The Cybersecurity Group also engages third parties for assessments and audits of its systems periodically and as needed.  Such assessments and audits may include, among other things, pre-production evaluation of technologies, overall program assessments, and compliance program assessments including audits by our regulators.\nDepending on the products and services provided and the potential for data exchange and technology risk, we may require vendors and service providers to pass APS’s vendor risk management program, which sets forth security and data protection requirements, as a condition to doing or continuing to do business with us.  For contracts with vendors that will handle or have access to certain sensitive data, APS requires contractual provisions setting forth cybersecurity controls, vulnerability management, secure development practices, and other security and data protection requirements.  A subset of vendors that meet a predetermined risk profile due to strategic relationships, technology risk, or other factors is continually monitored by a third-party risk management service, and the Company annually reviews independent assessments of these vendors.\nThe Cybersecurity Group also has documented processes for identifying, responding to, and internally escalating cybersecurity incidents.  Once an incident meets certain criteria, the Company’s Cybersecurity Incident Command or, in the most severe cases that impact the entire Company, the Corporate Emergency Operations Center is activated and formal response procedures are followed to address the incident.  The Cybersecurity Group has a formal incident response plan that details response and escalation procedures, including activation of a Cybersecurity Disclosure Committee, consisting of the Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel, to assess an incident’s materiality with input as needed from the Director of Cybersecurity, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Information Officer, and others, including outside advisors.\n48\nCybersecurity risk management has been integrated into the Company’s overall enterprise risk management program (the “Enterprise Risk Management Program”) through policies and processes that implement a risk management framework designed to identify, manage, and monitor business unit risks throughout the organization.  The Enterprise Risk Management Program is overseen by an executive committee (the “Executive Risk Committee”), which meets at least quarterly and is comprised of members holding executive leadership positions in the Company, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President, and other Executive and Senior Vice Presidents, and is chaired and sponsored by the Chief Financial Officer.  Every year, as a part of the Enterprise Risk Management Program, the top risks affecting the Company are identified.  For 2023, cybersecurity was identified as a top risk.  The applicable subject matter experts brief the Company’s Board of Directors on the status of all top enterprise risks at least once per year.  Finally, the Nuclear and Operating Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors provides ultimate oversight of cybersecurity risk and also receives briefings at least twice per year from the Cybersecurity Group, and notable audit findings relating to cybersecurity are aggregated and provided to the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee.\nTo date, we do not believe there have been risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Pinnacle West or APS.  However, there is no assurance that will continue to be the case.  If a significant cybersecurity event or incident were to occur, our ability to fulfill our critical business functions and our business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition could all be materially impacted.  See the risk factor entitled, “We are subject to cybersecurity risks and risks of unauthorized access to our systems that could adversely affect our business and financial condition” in Item 1A—Risk Factors for more information.\n49"

APS also owns and maintains 485 substations, including both transmission and distribution yards.  APS shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies.\n51\nThe following table shows APS’s jointly-owned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023:\nExpansion.\nEach year, APS prepares and files with the ACC a Ten-Year Transmission Plan.  In APS’s 2024 Ten-Year Plan, APS projects it will develop 109 miles of new transmission lines over the next 10 years.  Additionally, APS plans to upgrade 730 miles of existing transmission lines over the same horizon.  The 2024 Ten-Year Plan includes a new 28-mile 500kV line from the Jojoba substation to the Rudd substation.  The purpose of this 500kV line project is to bring in a new source to the west and southwest parts of the Phoenix metropolitan area which is experiencing rapid economic development.  This new source will provide customers in the area greater access to a diverse mix of resources from around the region.  Additionally, the 2024 Ten-Year Plan includes the rebuild of both Four Corners to Pinnacle Peak 345kV lines which span 289 miles each.  This rebuild will replace aging towers to ensure continued reliability and safety, increase important capability to the Metro Phoenix area, and improve access to a diverse mix of resources from the Four Corners region throughout the Southwest.  The 2024 Ten-Year Plan includes numerous projects with the purpose to interconnect new renewable energy resources to the transmission system.\nPlant and Transmission Line Leases and Rights-of-Way on Indian Lands\nThe Navajo Plant and Four Corners are located on land held under leases from the Navajo Nation and also under rights-of-way from the federal government.  The Navajo Plant ceased operations in November 2019.  The co-owners and the Navajo Nation executed a lease extension on November 29, 2017, that allows for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceased operations.\nAPS, on behalf of the Four Corners participants, negotiated amendments to the Four Corners facility lease with the Navajo Nation, which extends the Four Corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041.  See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Coal-Fueled Generating Facilities — Four Corners” in Item 1 for additional information about the Four Corners right-of-way and lease matters.\n52\nCertain portions of our transmission lines are located on Indian lands pursuant to rights-of-way that are effective for specified periods.  Some of these rights-of-way have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate Indian tribes or federal agencies.  Other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe or federal agencies will be required at that time.  In recent negotiations, certain of the affected Indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rights-of-way.  The ultimate cost of renewal of certain of the rights-of-way for our transmission lines is therefore uncertain."

This discussion provides a comparison of the 2023 results with 2022 results.  For the discussion of 2022 compared to 2021, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which specific discussion is incorporated herein by reference.  For information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate, see “Forward-Looking Statements” at the front of this report and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.\nOVERVIEW\nBusiness Overview\nPinnacle West is an investor-owned electric utility holding company based in Phoenix, Arizona with consolidated assets of approximately $25 billion.\nFor over 130 years, Pinnacle West and our affiliates have provided energy and energy-related products to people and businesses throughout Arizona.\nPinnacle West derives essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our principal subsidiary, APS.\nAPS is Arizona’s largest and longest-serving electric company that generates safe, affordable and reliable electricity for approximately 1.4 million retail customers in 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties.\nAPS is also the operator and co-owner of Palo Verde — a primary source of electricity for the southwestern United States.\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\n“\nIRA\n”\n).\nThe IRA significantly expands the availability of tax credits for investments in clean energy generation technologies and energy storage.\nKey provisions that are relevant to APS’s clean energy commitment include (i) an extension of tax credits for solar and wind generation, including a new option for solar investments to claim a Production Tax Credit (\n“\nPTC\n”\n) in lieu of the Investment Tax Credit (\n“\nITC\n”\n) beginning in 2022; (ii) expansion of the ITC to cover stand-alone energy storage technology beginning in 2023; and (iii) introduction of a new PTC for nuclear energy produced by existing nuclear energy plants (“Nuclear PTC”), available from 2024 through 2032.\nThe Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury have issued preliminary guidance related to various provisions of the IRA that have enabled APS to claim credits related to its 2023 solar and battery investments.  The Company continues to await regulations and other guidance, including with respect to the Nuclear PTC, which will provide additional details and clarifications regarding how the Company may be able to claim IRA tax credits in future years.\nIn addition, the IRA contains several provisions which could create additional tax liabilities for corporations, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for corporations with net profits in excess of $1 billion and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks.\nWe currently do not believe the Company will be subject to any material tax liabilities as a result of these legislative provisions.\n57\nStrategic Overview\nOur strategy is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona that delivers shareholder value and shared value by serving our customers with reliable, affordable, and clean energy.\nCustomer-Focused\nRecognizing that creating customer value is inextricably linked to increasing shareholder value, APS’s focus remains on its customers and the communities it serves.\nAccordingly, it is APS’s goal to achieve an industry-leading, best-in-class customer experience, while demonstrating compassion and advocacy for its customers.\nThis multi-year objective includes incrementally improving APS’s J.D. Power (“JDP”) overall customer satisfaction ratings to achieve a first quartile ranking in its peer set comprised of large investor-owned utilities.\nAPS has made noteworthy progress on that front.\nAs previously disclosed, APS’s JDP Residential rankings for overall customer satisfaction improved in each of 2020, 2021, and 2022, and have improved again in 2023.  At the end of 2023, APS’s residential customer satisfaction ranked in the second quartile among large investor-owned utilities, and its business customer satisfaction ranked in the second quartile of utilities nationally.\nReliable\nWhile our energy mix evolves, APS’s obligation to deliver reliable service to our customers remains.\nAPS is managing through significant growth in the Phoenix metropolitan area while experiencing supply chain issues similar to other industries.\nPlanned investments will support operating and maintaining the grid, updating technology, accommodating customer growth, and enabling more renewable energy resources.  To prioritize reliability and meet substantial growth in residential and commercial energy needs, APS has developed a future-focused, strategic transmission plan.  This Ten-Year Plan includes five critical transmission projects that comprise the APS strategic transmission portfolio, which represents a significant upgrade to APS’s transmission system.  These five projects, along with other projects included in the Ten-Year Plan, are intended to support growing energy needs, strengthen reliability, and allow for the connection of new resources.\nOur advanced distribution management system allows operators to locate outages and control line devices remotely and helps them coordinate more closely with field crews to safely maintain an increasingly dynamic grid.\nThe system will also integrate a new meter data management system that will increase grid visibility and give customers access to more of their energy usage data.\nWildfire safety remains a critical focus for APS and other utilities.\nWe have\nincreased investment in fire mitigation efforts to clear defensible space around our infrastructure, continue ongoing system upgrades, build partnerships with government entities and first responders and educate customers and communities.  We also increased spend on mitigating the risk associated with trees that could cause hazards, resulting in more of these trees being removed before they could cause outages or wildfires.  These programs contribute to customer reliability, responsible forest management and safe communities.  With recent wildfire events in Hawaii and across North America, we have been devoting and will continue to devote substantial efforts to analyzing and developing enhancements to our systems and processes to mitigate fire risk within our service territory and communities, including by hardening our infrastructure, deploying new technologies where appropriate, increasing our awareness, implementing operational\n58\nchanges, and enhancing our wildfire response capabilities.  APS completed implementation of best-in-class fire modelling software that we are utilizing to more surgically identify and calculate risk and target future system improvement investments such as fire-resistant pole wrapping, wood to steel pole conversions, and additional remote-controllable field devices like reclosers and switches.  APS also currently intends to implement a public safety power shutoff (“PSPS”) program for this upcoming fire season, leveraging the additional real-time analysis provided by the new modelling software.  We continue to evaluate policy and regulatory options, as well as insurance programs, to mitigate the impact of wildfire events.\nMaintaining reliability and affordability for our customers during the clean energy transition is fundamental to our strategy.  As a critical partner to the large quantity of renewables and energy storage we are adding to our system, natural gas generation will play an important role in maintaining reliability for our customers.  One example is the 2019 addition of new natural gas units at the modernized Ocotillo Power Plant to provide cleaner-running and more efficient units.  Additionally, efficiency improvements to gas units at the Redhawk and Sundance Power Plants are planned for completion prior to the summer of 2024.\nAs part of a balanced energy portfolio, these flexible resource additions support reliability by responding quickly to the variability of solar generation and delivering energy in the late afternoon and early evening when solar production declines as the sun sets and customer demand peaks.  Complementary to and in support of the transition to renewable resources, APS continues to evaluate options to meet growing energy demand and ensure grid reliability, including through upgrades to and/or modernization of additional existing natural gas facilities.\nIn October 2021, APS announced plans to evaluate regional market solutions as part of the informal Western Markets Exploratory Group (“WMEG”).  As a member of WMEG, APS is exploring the potential for a staged approach to new market services, including day-ahead energy sales, transmission system expansion, and other power supply and grid solutions consistent with existing state regulations.  WMEG hopes to identify market solutions that can help achieve carbon reduction goals while supporting reliable, affordable service for customers.  APS is unable to predict the outcome of these discussions.\nAPS will go live with a new Energy Management System (“EMS”) in March of 2024.  The new EMS will better allow for integration of the renewable and energy storage assets into the APS’s generation resources.  This integration will allow APS to maximize the flexibility of our resources and fully engage in the Energy Imbalance Market.  It also better positions APS to participate in market opportunities that may develop through the next decade.\nAPS’s key elements to delivering reliable power include resource planning, sufficient reserve margins, customer partnerships to manage peak demand, fire mitigation, and operational preparedness.\nSeasonal readiness procedures at APS also include inspections to ensure good material conditions and critical control system surveys.\nAPS also plans for the unexpected by conducting emergency operations drills and coordinating on fire and emergency management with federal, state, and local agencies.\nAffordable\nAPS continues to focus on mitigating the cost pressures related to the current inflationary environment.  Overall inflation grew by 2.7% in Phoenix and 3.4% nationally during 2023.  In 2022, overall inflation grew by 9.5% in Phoenix and 6.5% nationally.  The impacts from inflation have varied across separate categories of APS’s spending, including increases of up to 15% in 2023.  APS has seen inflationary impacts in supply constrained categories related to electrical equipment, such as transformers,\n59\nwire, and cable impacted by high utility demand outpacing manufacturing capacity.  Inflation continues to impact service rates and spend categories through pass-through costs such as supplier’s increased material costs, cost of insurance, and wage rates.\nAPS’s customer affordability initiative includes internal opportunities, such as training and mentoring employees on identifying efficiency opportunities; maintaining an inventory to take advantage of lower pricing and avoid expediting fees; entering into long-term contracts to hedge against price volatility, which has allowed APS to mitigate against procurement spend areas such as transformers; and implementing automation technologies to enhance efficiencies and increase data-oriented decision making.\nThere are also external opportunities under APS’s customer affordability initiative, such as APS’s participation in the Western Energy Imbalance Market (“WEIM”).  WEIM continues to be a tool for creating savings for APS’s customers from the real-time, voluntary market.  APS continues to expect that its participation in WEIM will lower its fuel and purchased-power costs, improve situational awareness for system operations in the Western Interconnection power grid, and improve integration of APS’s renewable resources.  APS is participating in market design and tariff development of Markets+, a day-ahead and real-time market offering from Southwest Power Pool.  APS also participated in the design and drafting of the tariff for the CAISO’s Extended Day-Ahead Market, which was approved by FERC in December 2023.  In addition, APS is participating in the Western Resource Adequacy Program administered by Western Power Pool.  These efforts are driven by three objectives of reducing customer cost, improving reliability, and incorporating more clean energy on APS’s system.\nIn terms of generation affordability, every three years, APS performs a comprehensive study, called an Integrated Resource Plan, to identify how much energy our customers will need over the next 15 years and what resources will be used to meet those needs.  In developing the IRP, APS considers factors that include how much economic growth is expected, what new technologies might be available and how weather can impact the demand for energy.  These inputs are then used to develop a plan that prioritizes reliability, affordability, and a clean, balanced energy mix.\nIn November 2023, APS released its latest IRP, which shows that energy demand is growing at an unprecedented rate.  This is due to continued residential and commercial customer growth throughout Arizona.  To keep pace with the fast-growing demand for electricity and maintain reliability, APS needs to add new electricity generating resources.  To ensure that the most affordable and reliable solutions are selected, APS issued All-Source Request for Proposals (“RFPs”) in 2022 and 2023.\nThese RFPs are open to all technologies, including customer-scale (behind the meter) and utility-scale (front of the meter) resources.  Through this process, APS has consistently found that clean resources like wind and solar, when coupled with energy storage technology, are among the most affordable options available today.  Over the long term, these resources are expected to provide the greatest value as part of a diverse energy mix.\nIn addition to managing the cost of electricity generation, APS has continued building upon existing cost management efforts, including a customer affordability initiative launched in 2019.\nThe initiative was implemented company-wide to thoughtfully and deliberately assess our business processes and organizational approaches to completing high-value work and achieving internal efficiencies.\nAPS continues to drive this initiative by identifying opportunities to streamline its business processes, mitigate cost increases, increase employee retention, and improve customer satisfaction.\n60\nClean Energy Commitment\nWe are committed to doing our part to build a clean and carbon-free future.\nAs Arizona stewards, we do what is right for the people and prosperity of Arizona.\nOur vision is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona by providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy to our customers.\nWe can accomplish our vision by collaborating with customers, communities, employees, policymakers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nOur clean energy commitment is based on sound science and supports continued growth and economic development while maintaining reliability and affordable prices for APS’s customers.\nAPS’s clean energy commitment consists of three parts:\n•\nA 2050 goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity;\n•\nA 2030 target to achieve a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy; and\n•\nA commitment to exit from coal-fired generation by 2031.\nAPS’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment depends upon a number of important external factors, including a supportive regulatory environment, sales and customer growth, development of clean energy technologies, and continued access to capital markets among others.\n2050 Goal: 100% Clean, Carbon-Free Electricity.\nAchieving a fully clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050 is our aspiration.\nAchieving this 2050 goal will require, among other things, innovative thinking, emergent clean energy and storage technologies, upgrades and expansions to the grid, and supportive public policy.\n2030 Goal: 65% Clean Energy.\nAPS has an energy mix that is already 50% clean and plans to continue to add more renewables and energy storage.\nBy building on those plans, APS intends to attain an energy mix that is 65% clean by 2030, with 45% of APS’s generation portfolio coming from renewable energy.\n“Clean” is measured as percent of energy mix, which includes all carbon-free resources like nuclear, renewables, and demand-side management.\n“Renewable” energy includes generation resources such as solar, wind, and biomass, and is measured in accordance with the ACC’s Renewable Energy Standard as a percentage of retail sales.\nThis target will serve as a checkpoint for our resource planning, investment strategy, and customer affordability efforts as APS moves toward a 100% clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050.\n2031 Goal: Exit Coal-Fired Generation.\nThe plan to exit coal-fired generation by 2031 will require APS to stop relying on coal-generation at Four Corners.\nAPS has permanently retired more than 1,000 MW of coal-fired electric generating capacity.\nThese closures and other measures taken by APS have resulted in annual carbon emissions that were 24% lower in 2022 compared to 2005.\nIn addition, APS has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining Cholla units during 2025.\nIn June 2021, APS and the owners of Four Corners entered into an agreement that would allow Four Corners to operate seasonally at the election of the owners as early as fall 2023, subject to the necessary governmental approvals and conditions associated with changes in plant ownership.\nUnder seasonal operation, one generating unit would be shut down during seasons where electricity demand is reduced, such as the winter and spring.\nThe other unit would remain online year-round, subject to market\n61\nconditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages.\nAs of the date of this report,\nAPS has elected not to begin seasonal operation due to market conditions.\nRenewables.\nAPS’s IRP (see Note 3 for additional information) establishes the path to meeting our clean energy commitment and maintaining reliable electric service for our customers.  APS intends to strengthen its already diverse energy mix by increasing its investments in carbon-free resources.  Our IRP rapidly adds clean energy and storage resources while maintaining reliable and affordable service.  Its near-term actions are focused on clean, reliable energy and positive customer outcomes and include: (a) competitive all source requests for proposal (“RFPs”) that provide an on-ramp to procure additional clean energy resources such as solar, wind, energy storage, and DSM resources, all of which lead to a cleaner grid and (b) strategic, short-term wholesale market purchases from a combination of existing merchant natural gas units, neighboring utility systems and wholesale market participants that ensure operational reliability.\nAPS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources, including solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and biogas, that supports our commitment to clean energy.  This commitment is already strengthened by Palo Verde, one of the nation’s largest carbon-free, clean energy resource, which provides the foundation for reliable and affordable service for APS customers.  APS’s longer-term clean energy strategy includes pursuing the right mix of purchased power contracts for new facilities, procurement of new facilities to be owned by APS, and the ongoing development of distributed energy resources.  This balance will ensure an appropriately diverse portfolio designed to achieve the same operational reliability and customer affordability as APS’s near-term strategies.  In addition, APS is actively seeking to include future facility purchase options in its PPAs that will enable investments with greater financial flexibility.\nAPS uses competitive “all source” RFPs to pursue market resources that meet its system needs and offer the best value for customers.\nAPS selects projects based on cost, ability to meet system requirements and commercial viability, taking into consideration timing and likelihood of successful contracting and development.\nUnder current market conditions, APS must aggressively contract for resources that can withstand supply chain and other geopolitical pressures.\nAvailable projects are guided by IRP timelines and quantities and APS maintains a flexible approach that allows it to optimize system reliability and customer affordability through the RFP process.\nAgreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid.\nOn June 30, 2023, APS issued an RFP (the “2023 RFP”) seeking approximately 1,000 MW of reliable capacity, including at least 700 MW of renewable resources with a focus on in-service dates between 2026 and 2028.\nBids from the 2023 RFP were received on September 6, 2023, and APS has started negotiations on multiple projects, including a 400 MW wind facility PPA that was signed in December 2023.\n62\nThe following table summarizes the resources in APS’s renewable energy portfolio that are in operation or under development as of December 31, 2023.\nAgreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting, and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid.\n(a)    Includes rooftop solar facilities owned by third parties.  Distributed generation is produced in Direct Current and is converted to Alternating Current for reporting purposes.\n(b)    Applications received by APS that are not yet installed and online.\nEnergy Storage.\nAPS deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system, including energy storage.\nEnergy storage provides capacity, improves power quality, can be utilized for system regulation and, in certain circumstances, be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments.\nEnergy storage also aids in integrating renewable generation by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset.\nAPS is utilizing grid-scale energy storage projects to meet customer reliability requirements, increase renewable utilization, and to further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid.\nAs noted above, on June 30, 2023, APS issued the 2023 RFP seeking approximately 1,000 MW of reliable capacity, including at least 700 MW of renewable resources, including energy storage, with a focus on in-service dates between 2026 and 2028.\nAPS currently plans to install more than 2,700 MW of utility scale energy storage by 2026, including through energy storage projects under PPAs and AZ Sun retrofits as well as through resources solicited through current and future RFPs.\n63\nThe following table summarizes the resources in APS’s energy storage portfolio that are in  operation and under development as of December 31, 2023.  Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions.\n(a)    Includes 0.3 MW of APS-owned customer-sited batteries.\n(b)    Includes 19 MW of capacity that entered commercial operation in January 2024.\nPalo Verde\n.\nPalo Verde, one of the nation’s largest carbon-free, clean energy resources, will continue to be a foundational part of APS’s resource portfolio.\nPalo Verde is not just the cornerstone of our current clean energy mix; it also is a significant provider of clean energy to the southwestern United States.\nThe plant is a critical asset to the Southwest, generating more than 32 million MWh annually – enough power for roughly 3.4 million households, or approximately 8.5 million people.\nIts continued operation is important to a carbon-free and clean energy future for Arizona and the region, a\ns a reliable, continuous, affordable resource and as a large contributor to the local economy.\nDeveloping Clean Energy Technologies\nElectric Vehicles\nAs a part of the statewide transportation electrification plan (“TE Plan”) approved by the ACC in 2021, APS has a goal of supporting 450,000 light-duty electric vehicles (“EV”) in its service territory by 2030.\nIn furtherance of this goal, through its Take Charge AZ Pilot Program, and as of December 31, 2023, APS installed 758 Level 2 charging ports at 183 customer locations and DC fast charging stations that are owned and operated by APS at five locations in Arizona.\nIn December 2023, the ACC voted to discontinue the Take Charge AZ Pilot Program (“TCAZ”) while allowing APS to complete projects that were already underway.\nAdditionally, as part of APS’s DSM Plan, APS launched an Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Management Pilot Program to proactively address the growing electric demand from charging as EVs become more widely adopted.\nThe EV related programs in the DSM Plan also include the APS SmartCharge data gathering program, Fleet Advisory Services, and a $100 rebate to home builders for new homes to be built EV-ready with 240V charging station garage outlets.\nAPS filed its 2024 DSM Plan on November 30, 2023.  The 2024 DSM Plan includes APS’s 2024 TE Plan and, among other things, proposes two new programs: an expanded residential EV Charging Demand Management Program, and a Commercial EV Make-Ready Program.\nThe ACC has yet to decide on the 2024 DSM Plan.\nHydrogen Production\nOn May 12, 2022, Arizona’s three public universities, along with four Arizona energy providers, including APS, announced the formation of a new, interdisciplinary coalition, called the Arizona Center for a Carbon Neutral Economy (“AzCaNE”), with the goal of achieving a carbon neutral economy in Arizona.  AzCaNE’s first action was to pursue an Arizona-led approach to securing regional clean hydrogen hub\n64\nfunding.\nLeading professionals from the seven founding participants, along with representatives of Arizona, the Navajo Nation and companies working to develop a hydrogen ecosystem within Arizona, make up the Governance Committee for AzCaNE’s efforts.  AzCaNE submitted an initial hydrogen hub concept paper to the DOE, which in turn encouraged the submission of a full application for funding.  In response, AzCaNE formed the Southwest Clean Hydrogen Innovation Network (“SHINe”) and submitted an application for funding its behalf.  SHINe was not, however, selected as one of the seven regional hubs to be awarded funding by DOE.  APS is currently maintaining a participatory role in AzCaNE as the organization continues to explore ways to educate stakeholders and promote low-carbon technologies.\nCarbon Capture\nCarbon Capture Utilization and Storage (“CCUS”) technologies can isolate CO\n2\nand either sequester it permanently in geologic formations or convert it for use in products.\nCurrently, almost all existing fossil fuel generators do not control carbon emissions the way they control emissions of other air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen.\nCCUS technologies are still in the demonstration phase and while they show promise, they are still being tested in real-world conditions.\nThese technologies could offer the potential to keep in operation existing generators that otherwise would need to be retired.\nAPS will continue to monitor this emerging technology, particularly in regard to EPA’s proposed Greenhouse Gas (GHG) rule.\nOn May 23, 2023, the EPA proposed regulations for GHG emissions that would, among other things, require CCUS technologies for certain classifications of coal-, oil-, and natural gas-fired electricity generating units dependent upon a variety of factors including retirement date and operating capacity.\nSee Note 10 for more information.\nSustainability Practices\nIn 2020, in support of our clean energy commitment and the growing focus on sustainability within our organization, we increased our focus on sustainability by dedicating a new Sustainability Department at Pinnacle West responsible for\nintegrating responsible business practices into the everyday work of the Company.\nThe Sustainability Department engaged the Electric Power Research Institute (“EPRI”) and leveraged input from employees, large customers, limited-income advocates, economic development groups, environmental non-governmental organizations, leading sustainability academics and other stakeholders to identify and assess the sustainability issues that matter most.\nIn total, 23 Priority Sustainability Issues (“PSIs”) were identified and prioritized.\nThe most critical category includes four issues deemed most important and most able to be impacted by our actions: clean energy, customer experience, energy access and reliability, and safety and health.\nThese PSIs provide the foundation for informing our strategic direction, creating a framework for incorporating best practices and driving enterprise-wide alignment and accountability.\nThe Company also benchmarked best practices within the top four PSIs and has utilized this information to identify opportunities for improvement.\nFinally, the Company maintains an annual Corporate Responsibility Report on the Pinnacle West website (\nwww.pinnaclewest.com/corporate-responsibility\n).  The report provides information related to the Company’s sustainability practices and performance.  The information on Pinnacle West’s website, including the Corporate Responsibility Report, is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report.\n65\nArtificial Intelligence\nTo address the emergence of artificial intelligence technology risk and opportunities, APS has developed a cross functional governance structure with leadership and experts from our information technology, cybersecurity, human resources, ethics, supply chain, legal, and nuclear generation teams.  This cross functional structure will assess both the opportunities and risks during the technology intake process to ensure compliance with data security and reliability requirements, while observing market trends in this rapidly evolving area.\nRegulatory Overview\n2022 Retail Rate Case\nAPS filed an application with the ACC on October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Rate Case”) seeking an increase in annual retail base rates on the date rates become effective (“Day 1”) of a net $\n460\nmillion.\nThis Day 1 net impact represents a total base revenue deficiency of $772 million offset by proposed adjustor transfers of cost recovery to annual retail rates and adjustor mechanism modifications.\nThe average annual customer bill impact of APS’s request on Day 1 is an increase of\n13.6%\n.\nThe principal provisions of APS’s application were:\n•\na test year comprised of twelve months ended June 30, 2022, adjusted as described below;\n•\nan original cost rate base of $\n10.5\nbillion, which approximates the ACC-jurisdictional portion of the book value of utility assets, net of accumulated depreciation and other credits;\n•\nthe following proposed capital structure and costs of capital:\n•\na 1% return on the increment of fair value rate base above APS’s original cost rate base, as provided for by Arizona law;\n•\na rate of $0.038321 per kWh for the portion of APS’s retail base rates attributable to fuel and purchased power costs;\n•\nmodification of its adjustment mechanisms including:\n▪\neliminate the Environmental Improvement Surcharge (“EIS”) and collect costs through base rates,\n▪\neliminate the Lost Fixed Cost Recovery (“LFCR”) mechanism and collect costs through base rates and the Demand Side Management Adjustment Charge (“DSMAC”),\n▪\nmaintain as inactive the Tax Expense Adjustor Mechanism (“TEAM”),\n▪\nmaintain the Transmission Cost Adjustment (“TCA”) mechanism,\n▪\nmodify the performance incentive in the DSMAC, and\n▪\nmodify the Renewable Energy Adjustment Charge (“REAC”) to include recovery of capital carrying costs of APS owned renewable and storage resources;\n•\nchanges to its limited-income program, including a second tier to provide an additional discount for customers with greater need; and\n66\n•\ntwelve months of post-Test Year plant investments to reflect used and useful projects that will be placed into service prior to July 1, 2023.\nOn June 5, 2023 and June 15, 2023, the ACC Staff, the Residential Utility Consumer Office (“RUCO”) and other intervenors filed their initial written testimony with the ACC.\nThe ACC Staff recommends among other things, (i) a $251 million revenue increase or, as an alternative, a $312 million revenue increase, (ii) a 9.6% return on equity, (iii) a 0.0% fair value increment or, as an alternative, a 0.75% fair value increment, and (iv) a continuation of a 12-month post-test year plant.\nRUCO recommends, among other things, (i) an $84.9 million revenue increase, (ii) an 8.2% return on equity or, as an alternative, an 8.7% return on equity if the ACC imputes a hypothetical capital structure with a 46% equity layer, (iii) a fair value increment of 0.0%, and (iv) a reduction of post-test year plant to six months.\nOn July 12, 2023, APS filed rebuttal testimony addressing the ACC Staff and intervenors’ direct testimonies.\nThe principal provisions of APS’s rebuttal testimony were:\n•\nreducing the revenue requirement increase to $383.1 million, which reduced the average annual customer bill impact to an increase of 11.3%;\n•\nmaintaining a return on equity request of 10.25%;\n•\nreducing the increment of fair value rate base return to 0.5% from 1.0%;\n•\nmaintaining a post-test year plant request of 12 months, plus the Four Corners Effluent Limitation Guidelines (“ELG”) project;\n•\nwithdrawing the Payment Fee Removal Proposal (net reduction) which was originally requested in APS’s initial application;\n•\nmaintaining the LFCR and DSMAC as separate adjustors;\n•\nincreasing the PSA annual rate change limit from $0.004/kWh to $0.006/kWh;\n•\nproposing a new System Reliability Benefit (“SRB”) recovery mechanism;\n•\nmaintaining the REAC in its current state;\n•\nmaintaining adjustor base transfers and elimination of EIS; and\n•\nmaintaining the request to recover CCT funding.\nOn July 26, 2023, the ACC Staff, RUCO and other intervenors filed their surrebuttal testimony with the ACC.\nThe ACC Staff adjusted their initial recommendations to, among other things, (i) a $281.9 million revenue increase, (ii) a 9.68% return on equity, (iii) a 0.5% fair value increment, (iv) a continuation of a 12-month post-test year plant that includes the Four Corners ELG project, and (v) support of an increase to the annual PSA increase limit to $0.006/kWh.\nRUCO maintained their direct position and also recommended further review of the PSA in a second phase of the 2022 Rate Case.\nOn August 4, 2023, APS filed rejoinder testimony addressing the ACC Staff and intervenors’ surrebuttal testimonies.\nAPS’s rejoinder testimony included final post-Test Year Plant values, reducing the revenue requirement increase to $377.7 million from $383.1 million, which reduced the average annual customer bill impact to an increase of 11.2%.\nAll other major provisions from APS’s rebuttal testimony were maintained in its rejoinder testimony.\nOn November 6, 2023, and November 21, 2023, APS and stakeholders filed briefs in the 2022 Rate Case.  APS’s briefs included the reduction of the total revenue requirement increase to $376.2 million and a resulting average annual customer bill impact increase of 11.1%.  All other major provisions from APS’s rejoinder testimony were maintained in its briefs.  ACC Staff’s briefs included a proposed total revenue\n67\nrequirement increase from $281.9 million to $282.7 million and also included their support of APS’s SRB mechanism, contingent on increased stakeholder outreach.\nOn January 25, 2024, an Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Opinion and Order in the 2022 Rate Case, as corrected on February 6, 2024 (the “2022 Rate Case ROO”).  The 2022 Rate Case ROO recommended, among other things, (i) a $523.1 million increase in the annual base rate revenue requirement, (ii) a 9.55% return on equity, (iii) a 0.25% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of 4.36%, (v) 12 months of post-test year plant and the inclusion of the Four Corners ELG project, (vi) the approval of APS’s SRB proposal with certain procedural and other modifications, (vii) no additional CCT funding, (viii) a 5.0% return on the prepaid pension asset and a return of 5.35% on the OPEB liability, and (ix) no disallowances on APS’s coal contracts.\nThe 2022 Rate Case ROO also recommended a number of changes to existing adjustors, including (i) the approval of modified DSM performance incentives and the requested DSM transfer to base rates, (ii) the retention of $1.9 million of REAC in the adjustor rather than base rates, (iii) a partial transfer of $27.1 million of LFCR funds to base rates, and (iv) the adoption of an increase in the annual PSA cap to $0.006/kWh.\nOn February 22, 2024, the ACC approved a number of amendments to the 2022 Rate Case ROO that resulted in, among other things, (i) an approximately $491.7 million increase in the annual base revenue requirement, (ii) a 9.55% return on equity, (iii) a 0.25% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of 4.39%, (v) a return set at the Company’s weighted average cost of capital on the net prepaid pension asset and net other post-employment benefit liability in rate base, (vi) an adjustment to generation maintenance and outage expense  to reflect a more reasonable level of test year costs, (vii) approval of the SRB mechanism with modifications to customer notifications, procedural timelines and the inclusion of any qualifying technology and fuel source bid received through an all-source RFP, and (viii) recovery of all DSM costs through the DSMAC rather than through base rates.\nThe ACC’s decision results in an expected total net annual revenue increase for APS of approximately $253.4 million and a roughly 8% increase to the typical residential customer’s bill.  The ACC is expected to issue the final order for the 2022 Rate Case in March 2024 with the new rates to become effective for all service rendered on and after March 8, 2024.\n2019 Retail Rate Case\nOn October 31, 2019, APS filed an application with the ACC (the “2019 Rate Case”) for an annual increase in retail base rates.\nOn August 2, 2021, an Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Opinion and Order in the 2019 Rate Case (the “2019 Rate Case ROO”) and issued corrections on\nSeptember 10 and September 20, 2021.\nSubsequently, the ACC approved an amended 2019 Rate Case ROO on November 2, 2021 (the “2019 Rate Case Decision”).  See Note 3 for information regarding the 2019 Rate Case ROO.\nAfter the 2019 Rate Case Decision, APS filed an application for rehearing of the 2019 Rate Case and later filed a Notice of Direct Appeal by APS at the Arizona Court of Appeals, requesting review of certain matters from the 2019 Rate Case Decision.  The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the ACC’s decision in the 2019 Rate Case, remanding the issue to the ACC for further proceedings.  On June 14, 2023, APS and the ACC Legal Division filed a joint resolution with the ACC to\n68\nallow recovery of $215.5 million in costs related to the installation of the Four Corners SCR project, a reversal of the 20-basis point reduction to APS’s return on equity from 8.9% to 8.7% as a result of the 2019 Rate Case Decision, and recovery of $59.6 million in revenue lost by APS between December of 2021 and June 20, 2023.\nThe joint resolution provides for a new Court Resolution Surcharge (“CRS”) mechanism, which is designed to recover the $59.6 million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and      June 20, 2023, and the prospective recovery of ongoing costs related to the SCR investments and expense and the allowable return on equity difference in current base rates.\nOn June 21, 2023, the ACC approved the joint resolution and proposals therein for recovery through the CRS mechanism, which became effective on July 1, 2023.\nThe current CRS will be recalculated at the end of the 2022 Rate Case to remove the effects of the prospective recovery related to the allowable return on equity difference.  On       February 22, 2024, the ACC approved the 2022 Rate Case.  The CRS tariff is currently being recalculated to reflect the final decision in that case.  See Note 3 for more information regarding the 2019 Rate Case and Four Corners SCR cost recovery.\nThe portion of the CRS representing the recovery of the $59.6 million of lost revenue between December of 2021 and June 20, 2023, $9.4 million of which has been collected as of December 31, 2023, will cease upon full collection of the lost revenue.\nFinally, recovery of ongoing costs related to the SCR investments will continue until the Company’s next rate case in which they can be incorporated therein.\nRegulatory Lag Docket\nOn January 5, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to explore the possibility of modifications to the ACC’s historical test year rules.  The ACC requested comments from utilities and interested parties on ways to reduce regulatory lag, including alternative ratemaking structures such as future test years and hybrid test years.  APS filed comments on June 1, 2023.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nSee Note 3 for information regarding additional regulatory matters.\nFinancial Strength and Flexibility\nPinnacle West and APS currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company.  Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.\nOther Subsidiaries\nPNW Power and BCE\n.\nOn August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of our equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary BCE to Ameresco (the “BCE Sale”).  The transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business and closed in multiple stages.  Certain investments and assets that BCE previously held, including the TransCanyon joint venture and holdings in the two Tenaska wind farm investments, were not included in the BCE Sale and were instead transferred to Pinnacle West Power, LLC (“PNW Power”), a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West.\nThe BCE Sale transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business and closed in multiple stages. As of December 31, 2023, all of BCE assets were classified as held for sale.  The final closing of the BCE Sale was on January 12, 2024.  See Note 20 for additional details.\n69\nPNW Power’s investments include TransCanyon, a 50/50 joint venture that was formed in 2014 with BHE U.S. Transmission LLC, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  TransCanyon is pursuing independent electric transmission opportunities within the 11 U.S. states that comprise the Western Interconnection, excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be provided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners’ utility affiliates.\nPNW Power’s investments also include minority ownership positions in two wind farms operated by Tenaska Energy, Inc. and Tenaska Energy Holdings, LLC, the 242 MW Clear Creek and the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind farms.  Clear Creek achieved commercial operation in May 2020; however, in the fourth quarter of 2022, PNW Power’s equity method investment was fully impaired.  Nobles 2 achieved commercial operation in December 2020.  Both wind farms deliver power under long-term PPAs.  PNW Power indirectly owns 9.9% of Clear Creek and 5.1% of Nobles 2.\nEl Dorado\n.\nEl Dorado is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West.  El Dorado owns debt investments and minority interests in several energy-related investments and Arizona community-based ventures.  In particular, El Dorado has committed to the following:\n•\n$25 million investment in the Energy Impact Partners fund, of which $16.7 million  has been funded as of December 31, 2023.  Energy Impact Partners is an organization that focuses on fostering innovation and supporting the transformation of the utility industry.\n•\n$25 million investment in AZ-VC (formerly invisionAZ Fund), of which $6.3 million has been funded as of December 31, 2023.  AZ-VC is a fund focused on analyzing, investing, managing, and otherwise dealing with investments in privately-held early stage and emerging growth technology companies and businesses primarily based in Arizona, or based in other jurisdictions and having existing or potential strategic or economic ties to companies or other interests in Arizona.\nThe remainder of these investment commitments will be contributed by El Dorado as each investment fund selects and makes investments.\nKey Financial Drivers\nIn addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above, many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook, including those listed below.  We closely monitor these factors to plan for the Company’s current needs, and to adjust our expectations, financial budgets and forecasts appropriately.\nElectric Operating Revenues.\nFor the years 2021 through 2023, retail electric revenues comprised approximately 91% of our total operating revenues.\nOur electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline, variations in weather from period to period, customer mix, average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs, distributed energy additions, electricity rates and tariffs, the recovery of PSA deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms.\nThese revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions, including competition, demand, and prices.\n70\nActual and Projected Customer and Sales Growth.\nRetail customers in APS’s service territory increased 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with the prior-year period.  For the three years through 2023, APS’s customer growth averaged 2.1% per year.  We currently project annual customer growth to be 1.5% to 2.5% for 2024 and the average annual growth to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% through 2026 based on anticipated steady population growth in Arizona during that period.\nRetail electricity sales in kWh, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, increased 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with the prior-year period.  While steady customer growth was somewhat offset by weaker usage among residential customers, energy savings driven by customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, the main drivers of positive sales for this period were continued strong sales to commercial and industrial customers and the ramp-up of new data center customers.\nFor the three years through 2023, annual retail electricity sales growth averaged 2.7%, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations.  Due to the expected growth of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kWh will increase in the range of 2.0% to 4.0% for 2024 and that average annual growth will be in the range of 4.0% to 6.0% through 2026, including the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, but excluding the effects of weather variations.  These projected sales growth ranges include the impacts of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, which are expected to contribute to 2024 growth in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% and to average annual growth in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2026.\nLonger term, APS has been preparing for and can serve significant load growth from residential and business customers.  On top of these existing growth trends, APS is also now receiving unprecedented incremental requests for service from extra-large commercial energy users (over 25 MW) with very high energy demands that persist virtually around-the-clock.  These incremental requests for service by extra-large energy users far exceed available generation and transmission resource capacity in the Southwest region for the foreseeable future.  In April 2023, APS notified prospective extra-large customers without existing commitments from APS that it is not able to commit at this time to future extra-large projects of over 25 MW.  Because of the high growth in demand for such projects, APS has developed a prioritization queue that identifies and prioritizes projects while maintaining system reliability and affordability for existing APS customers.  APS is exploring available options for securing sufficient electric generation and transmission to meet these projections of future customer needs.\nActual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and energy conservation, slower ramp-up of and/or fewer data centers and large manufacturing facilities, slower than expected commercial and industrial expansions, impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in DG, responses to retail price changes, changes in regulatory standards, and impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations.  Based on past experience, a 1% variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $20 million, and a 1% variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $5 million.\nWeather.\nIn forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above, we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data.\nOur experience indicates that typical variations from normal\n71\nweather can result in increases and decreases in annual net income of up to $15 million; however, extreme weather variations have resulted in larger annual variations in net income.\nFuel and Purchased Power Costs.\nFuel and purchased power costs included on our Consolidated Statements of Income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel, our power plant performance, transmission availability or constraints, prevailing market prices, new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas, changes in our generation resource allocation, our hedging program for managing such costs and PSA deferrals and the related amortization.\nOperations and Maintenance Expenses\n.\nOperations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth, power plant operations, maintenance of utility plant (including generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), inflation, unplanned outages, planned outages (typically scheduled in the spring and fall), renewable energy and DSM related expenses (which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues) and other factors.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property (such as new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), and changes in depreciation and amortization rates.\nSee “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities.\nPension and Other Postretirement Non-Service Credits, Net\n.\nPension and other postretirement non-service credits can be impacted by changes in our actuarial assumptions.\nThe most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our net periodic costs/credit, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long-term, the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates.\nWe review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.\nProperty Taxes.\nTaxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are affected by the value of property in-service and under construction, assessment ratios, and tax rates.  The average property tax rate in Arizona for APS, which owns essentially all of our property, was 10.0% of the assessed value for 2023, 10.2% for 2022, and 10.7% for 2021.  Property taxes increased in 2023 due to higher plant balances related to expansion and improvements on our existing generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, partially offset by legislative changes reducing both property tax assessment ratios and rates in Arizona.\nIncome Taxes\n.\nIncome taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income, income tax rates, certain deductions, and non-taxable items, such as AFUDC.  In addition, income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities.\nInterest Expense.\nInterest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt.  See Note 6 for further details. The primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities, equity issuances and internally generated cash flow.\nAn allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction.\nWe stop accruing AFUDC on a project when it is placed into service.\n72\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPinnacle West’s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily sales supplied under traditional cost-based rate regulation) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.  All other segment activities are insignificant.  Our regulated electricity segment activities are conducted primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS.\nOperating Results – 2023 compared with 2022\nOur consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $502 million, compared with $484 million for the prior year.  The results reflect an increase of approximately $18 million, primarily as a result of the effects of weather, higher CRS and LFCR revenue, higher transmission revenue, increased sales and usage, and higher other income.  These positive factors were partially offset by higher interest charges, net of AFUDC, higher operations and maintenance expense, lower pension and other postretirement non-service credits, and higher depreciation and amortization expense mostly due to increased plant assets.\nThe following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders compared with the prior year for Pinnacle West consolidated and for APS consolidated:\n73\nOperating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses\n.\nOperating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were $208 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with the prior year.  The following table summarizes the major components of this change:\nOperations and maintenance\n.  Operations and maintenance expenses increased $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with the prior-year period primarily due to:\n•\nAn increase of $31 million primarily related to costs for renewable energy and similar regulatory programs, which are partially offset in operating revenues and purchased power;\n•\nAn increase of $22 million related to non-nuclear generation costs primarily due to higher operating costs and higher planned outages;\n•\nAn increase of $14 million related to transmission, distribution, and customer service;\n•\nAn increase of $13 million related to nuclear generation costs;\n•\nAn increase of $10 million related to information technology costs;\n•\nA decrease of $26 million related to employee benefits, largely due to decreased pension and other post-retirement service costs of $12 million and other miscellaneous factors.  See “pension and other postretirement non-service credits, net” below for additional discussion; and\n•\nAn increase of $8 million for corporate resources and other miscellaneous factors.\nDepreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $41 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior-year period primarily due to increased plant in service.\n74\nPension and other postretirement non-service credits, net.\nPension and other postretirement non-service credits, net were $57 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the effect of higher discount rates and actual market returns being lower than estimated returns in 2022.\nOther income and expenses, net.\nAll other income and expenses, net were $61 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior-year period primarily due to higher interest income, higher allowance for equity funds used during construction due to increased capital expenditures, Clear Creak wind farm impairment (see Note 10) recorded in the prior year period, and the gain on the BCE Sale.  See Note 20.  The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s other income and expenses, net primarily relates to BCE matters.\nInterest charges, net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction.\nInterest charges, net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction were $75 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior-year period primarily due to higher debt balances, higher commercial paper balances and higher interest rates in the current period, partially offset by higher allowance for borrowed funds due to increased capital expenditures.  The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s interest charges, net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction is primarily relates to Pinnacle West’s higher term loan interest and BCE debt activity.\nIncome taxes.\nIncome taxes were $2 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with the prior-year period primarily due to higher pre-tax income, partially offset by Investment Tax Credit amortization from our Arizona Sun battery facilities, and Production Tax Credits from our Agave Solar facility, both of which went into service in 2023.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nPinnacle West’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.  The level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our Board of Directors and based on a number of factors, including our financial condition, payout ratio, free cash flow and other factors.\nOur primary sources of cash are dividends from APS and external debt and equity issuances.  An ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40%.  As defined in the related ACC order, the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt.  At December 31, 2023, APS’s common equity ratio, as defined, was 49%.  Its total shareholder equity was approximately $7.2 billion, and total capitalization was approximately $14.7 billion.  Under this order, APS would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately $5.9 billion, assuming APS’s total capitalization remains the same.  This restriction does not materially affect Pinnacle West’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders.\nDividends to Pinnacle West from APS are also dependent on a number of factors including, among others, APS’s financial condition and free cash flow, the sources of which vary from quarter-to-quarter due in part to the seasonal nature of electricity demand.  APS’s sources of cash include cash from operations and external sources of liquidity, including long- and short-term external debt financing such as\n75\ncommercial paper and its revolving credit facility.  APS’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt.  APS funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, external debt financings and equity infusions from Pinnacle West.  APS is currently authorized to receive up to $150 million annually in equity infusions from Pinnacle West without seeking ACC approval.  On October 27, 2023, APS sought approval from the ACC to receive from Pinnacle West in 2024 up to an additional $500 million in equity infusions above the authorized limit of $150 million, and on January 9, 2024, the ACC approved the increased equity infusion limit for 2024.\nPinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities that enhance liquidity and provide credit support for accessing commercial paper markets.  These credit facilities mature in 2028.  See Note 5.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following tables present net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 (dollars in millions):\nPinnacle West Consolidated\nArizona Public Service Company\nOperating Cash Flows\n2023 Compared with 2022.\nPinnacle West’s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was $1,207 million in 2023 compared to $1,242 million in 2022, a decrease of $35 million in net cash provided primarily due to $204 million higher fuel and purchased power costs, $82 million higher payments for operations and maintenance costs, $66 million higher interest payments, $57 million lower customer advances for construction and $13 million change in net collateral, partially offset by $349 million higher cash receipts from electric revenues and $37 million lower income taxes.  The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s net cash provided by operating activities primarily relates to APS’s lower income tax cash payments to Pinnacle West and other changes in working capital.\nRetirement plans and other postretirement benefits.\nPinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries.  Pinnacle West also sponsors other postretirement benefit plans for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries.  The requirements of the Employee Retirement Income\n76\nSecurity Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan.  We contribute at least the minimum amount required under ERISA regulations, but no more than the maximum tax-deductible amount.  Under ERISA, the qualified pension plan was estimated to be 110% funded as of January 1, 2024, and was 112% as of January 1, 2023.  Future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions.  In 2022 and 2023, we did not make any contributions to our pension plan.  In 2021, we made contributions to our pension plan totaling $100 million.  The minimum required contributions for the pension plan are zero for the next three years and we do not expect to make any voluntary contributions in 2024, 2025 or 2026.  Regarding contributions to our other postretirement benefit plan, we did not make any contributions in 2023 or 2022 and do not expect to make any contributions in 2024, 2025 or 2026.   The Company was reimbursed $23 million in 2023, $26 million in 2022, and $24 million in 2021 for prior years retiree medical claims from the other postretirement benefit plan trust assets.  We continually monitor financial market volatility and its impact on our retirement plans and other postretirement benefits, but we believe our liability driven investment strategy helps to minimize the impact of market volatility on our plan’s funded status.  For instance, our pension plan’s funded status, as measured for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) purposes, was 102% funded as of December 31, 2023, and our postretirement benefit plans were 162% funded, as measured for GAAP purposes at December 31, 2023.  See Note 7 for additional details.\nThe CARES Act allows employers to defer payments of the employer share of Social Security payroll taxes that would have otherwise been owed from March 27, 2020, through December 31, 2020.  We deferred the cash payment of the employer’s portion of Social Security payroll taxes for the period  July 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, that was approximately $18 million.  As of December 31, 2022, we have paid this cash deferral in full.\nInvesting Cash Flows\n2023 Compared with 2022.\nPinnacle West’s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was $1,694 million in 2023 compared to $1,618 million in 2022, an increase of $76 million primarily related to increased capital expenditures and higher allowance for borrowed funds, partially offset by proceeds from the BCE Sale.  See Note 20.  The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s net cash used for investing activities primarily relates to the BCE Sale.\n77\nCapital Expenditures.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated capital expenditures for the next three years:\nCapital Expenditures\n(dollars in millions)\n(a)\nAPS Solar Communities program, energy storage, renewable projects, and other clean energy projects.\n(b)\nIncludes generation environmental projects.\n(c)\nPrimarily information systems and facilities projects.\nThe table above does not include capital expenditures related to PNW Power projects.\nGeneration capital expenditures are comprised of various additions and improvements to APS’s clean resources, including nuclear plants, renewables and ESS.\nGeneration capital expenditures also include additions and improvements to existing fossil plants, such as our current modernization project at our Sundance gas plant.\nExamples of the types of projects included in the forecast of generation capital expenditures are additions of renewables and energy storage, and upgrades and capital replacements of various nuclear and fossil power plant equipment, such as turbines, boilers, and environmental equipment.\nWe are monitoring the status of environmental matters, which, depending on their final outcome, could require modification to our planned environmental expenditures.\nDistribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades, capital replacements, and new customer construction.\nExamples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines, substations, and line extensions to new residential and commercial developments.\nCapital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.\n78\nFinancing Cash Flows and Liquidity\n2023 Compared with 2022.\nPinnacle West’s consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was $487 million in 2023 compared to $371 million in 2022, an increase of $116 million in net cash provided primarily due to a net increase in short-term borrowings of $193 million and $117 million lower long-term debt repayments, partially offset by $186 million in lower issuances of long-term debt and higher dividend payments of $8 million.\nAPS’s consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was $412 million in 2023 compared to $314 million in 2022, an increase of $98 million in net cash provided primarily due to a net increase in short-term borrowings of $135 million, partially offset by $29 million in lower issuances of long-term debt and higher dividend payments of $8 million.\nSignificant Financing Activities.\nOn December 13, 2023, the Pinnacle West Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.880 per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2024, to shareholders of record on February 1, 2024.  During 2023, Pinnacle West increased its indicated annual dividend from $3.46 per share to $3.52 per share.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, Pinnacle West’s total dividends paid per share of common stock were $3.48 per share, which resulted in dividend payments of $386 million.\nAvailable Credit Facilities\n.\nPinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide credit support for their commercial paper.  See Note 5 for more information on available credit facilities.\nOther Financing Matters.\nSee Note 15 for information related to the change in our margin and collateral accounts.\nDebt Provisions\nPinnacle West’s and APS’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios.  Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants.  For both Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%.  At December 31, 2023, the ratio was approximately 60% for Pinnacle West and 52% for APS.  Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could “cross-default” other debt.  See further discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.\nNeither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade.  However, our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings.\nAll of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  All of APS’s bank agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings.\n79\nOn December 15, 2022, the ACC issued a financing order reaffirming the previous short-term debt authorization equal to the sum of (i) 7% of APS’s capitalization, and (ii) $500 million  (which is required to be used for costs relating to purchases of natural gas and power) and approving APS’s application filed April 6, 2022 requesting to increase the long-term debt limit from $7.5 billion to $8.0 billion and to exclude financing lease PPAs from the definition of long-term debt for purposes of the ACC financing orders.  See Note 6 for further discussions of liquidity matters.\nCredit Ratings\nThe ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of February 15, 2024, are shown below.  We are disclosing these credit ratings to enhance understanding of our cost of short-term and long-term capital and our ability to access the markets for liquidity and long-term debt.  The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained.  There is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period.  The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.  Any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s or APS’s securities and/or result in an increase in the cost of, or limit access to, capital.  Such revisions may also result in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments, insurance policies, natural gas transportation, fuel supply, and other energy-related contracts.  At this time, we believe we have sufficient available liquidity resources to respond to a potential downward revision to our credit ratings.\nContractual Obligations\nPinnacle West has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs.  Material contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows:\n•\nPinnacle West and APS have material long-term debt obligations that mature at various dates through 2050 and bear interest principally at fixed rates.  Interest on variable-rate long-term debt is determined by using average rates at December 31, 2023.  See Note 6.\n•\nPinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities.  See Note 5 for short-term debt details.\n80\n•\nFuel and purchased power commitments include purchases of coal, electricity, natural gas, renewable energy, nuclear fuel, and natural gas transportation.  See Notes 3 and 10.  Purchase obligations include capital expenditures and other obligations.  See Note 10.  Commitments related to purchased power lease contracts are also considered fuel and purchased power commitments.  See Note 8.\n•\nAPS holds certain contracts to purchase renewable energy credits in compliance with the RES.  See Notes 3 and 10.\n•\nAPS is required to make payments to the noncontrolling interests related to the Palo Verde sale leaseback through 2033.  See Note 17.\n•\nAPS must reimburse certain coal providers for final and contemporaneous coal mine reclamation.  See Note 10.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period.  Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates.  We consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved.\nRegulatory Accounting\nRegulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the ACC and FERC, to be reflected in our financial statements.  Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.  Management judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets and/or a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction.  This determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in Arizona and is subject to change in the future.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings, except for pension benefits, which would be charged to OCI and result in lower future earnings.  Management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential ACC- or FERC-ordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities.  We had $2,016 million of regulatory assets and $2,176 million of regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023.  See Notes 1 and 3 for more information.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting\nChanges in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit assets, liabilities and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position. We review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.  The most relevant actuarial\n81\nassumptions are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (“EROA”), and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates.  Differences between these actuarial assumptions and actual plan results may create volatility in pension and other postretirement benefit expense.  To reduce this volatility, these differences are accumulated and amortized (subject to a corridor of 10% of the greater of plan assets or obligations) as part of the expense over a period of approximately 11 years.  Following are the most relevant actuarial assumptions:\nDiscount Rate.\nThe discount rate is used to measure the plan liability and net periodic cost.  For this assumption, we utilize a yield curve produced by our actuary as of December 31st and employ their projections of the future benefit payments to estimate the projected benefit obligation for each plan.  This process also yields a single equivalent discount rate that produces the same present value for the projection of estimated benefit payments that is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate to that year.  The spot rates are derived from a yield curve composed of domestic AA rated corporate bonds.\nEROA\n.  The EROA is used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long-term.  For this assumption, we consider historical experience and future expectations of asset classes utilized in the portfolio.\nHealthcare Cost Trend Rates.\nWe consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs and our actuary provides the Company with a medical trend recommendation based on national medical trend, historical claims performance, benchmarking, and plan design changes.\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the December 31, 2023, reported pension assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and our 2023 reported pension expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants, on the Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in millions):\n(a)\nEach fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point.\n(b)\nIn general, changes in the discount rate will not typically have symmetrical effects for increases and decreases of the rate.  Further, a 1% change in a low discount rate environment will have a larger impact than a 1% change in a high discount rate environment.  Therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated.  Additionally, the Pension Plan utilizes a liability-driven strategy for its pension asset portfolio, and the obligation and expense sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that a change in interest rates may have on pension asset values.\n82\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the December 31, 2023, other postretirement benefit obligation on the Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and our 2023 reported other postretirement benefit expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in millions):\n(a)\nEach fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point.\n(b)\nIn general, changes in the discount rate will not typically have symmetrical effects for increases and decreases of the rate.  Further, a 1% change in a low discount rate environment will have a larger impact than a 1% change in a high discount rate environment.  Therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated.\n(c)\nThis assumes a 1% change in the initial and ultimate healthcare cost trend rate.\nSee Note 7 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for derivative instruments, investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trusts fund, investments held in our other special use funds, certain cash equivalents, and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  We use inputs, or assumptions that market participants would use, to determine fair market value.  We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy.  The determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment.  Our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy.  Actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value.  See Note 1 for a discussion of accounting policies and Note 12 for fair value measurement disclosures.\n83\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize an ARO for the future decommissioning or retirement of our tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists.  The ARO liability represents an estimate of the fair value of the current obligation related to decommissioning and the retirement of those assets.  ARO measurements inherently involve uncertainty in the amount and timing of settlement of the liability.  We use an expected cash flow approach to measure the amount we recognize as an ARO.  This approach applies probability weighting to discounted future cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes.  The scenarios consider settlement of the ARO at the expiration of the asset’s current license or lease term and expected decommissioning dates.  The fair value of an ARO is recognized in the period in which it is incurred.  The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset and are depreciated over the life of the related assets.  In addition, we accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.  In accordance with GAAP accounting, APS accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets, even if there is no legal obligation for removal.\nAROs as of December 31, 2023 are described further in Note 11.\nOTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS\nSee Note 21 for two new accounting standards that were issued in November and December 2023, respectively, that are pending adoption:  ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, effective for us for annual periods on December 31, 2024, and interim periods thereafter, and ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, effective for us for annual periods on December 31, 2025.\nMARKET AND CREDIT RISKS\nMarket Risks\nOur operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices, investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trusts, other special use funds and benefit plan assets.\nInterest Rate and Equity Risk\nWe have exposure to changing interest rates.  Changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable-rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust, other special use funds (see Notes 12 and 18), and benefit plan assets.  The nuclear decommissioning trust, other special use funds and benefit plan assets also have risks associated with the changing market value of their equity and other non-fixed income investments.  Nuclear decommissioning, coal reclamation, and benefit plan costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices.\n84\nThe tables below present contractual balances of our consolidated long-term and short-term debt at the expected maturity dates, as well as the fair value of those instruments on December 31, 2023, and 2022.  If variable interest rates were to increase by 10% from the December 31, 2023, levels, it would not have a material effect on Pinnacle West Consolidated or APS Consolidated annual interest expense.  The interest rates presented in the tables below represent the weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2023, and 2022 (dollars in millions):\nPinnacle West – Consolidated\nThe tables below present contractual balances of APS’s long-term and short-term debt at the expected maturity dates, as well as the fair value of those instruments on December 31, 2023, and 2022.  The interest rates presented in the tables below represent the weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2023, and 2022 (dollars in millions):\n85\nAPS — Consolidated\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas.  Our risk management committee, consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees company-wide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies.  We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that may qualify as derivatives, including futures, forwards, options, and swaps.  As part of our risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities.\nThe following table shows the net pretax changes in mark-to-market of our energy derivative positions (dollars in millions):\n86\nThe table below shows the fair value of maturities of our energy derivative contracts (dollars in millions) at December 31, 2023, by maturities and by the type of valuation that is performed to calculate the fair values, classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  See Note 1, “Derivative Accounting” and “Fair Value Measurements,” for more discussion of our valuation methods.\nThe table below shows the impact that hypothetical price movements of 10% would have on the market value of our risk management assets and liabilities included on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in millions):\n(a)\nThese contracts are economic hedges of our forecasted purchases of natural gas and electricity.  The impact of these hypothetical price movements would substantially offset the impact that these same price movements would have on the physical exposures being hedged.  To the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion in the PSA, the amounts are recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability.\nCredit Risk\nWe are exposed to losses in the event of non-performance or non-payment by counterparties.  See Note 15 for a discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy."

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\n90\non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Accounting — Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements — Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nArizona Public Service Company (“APS”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is subject to rate regulation by the Arizona Corporation Commission (the “ACC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates charged by public service utilities in Arizona. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; fuel and purchased power; operations and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.\nThe ACC’s rate-making policies are premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the ACC in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable deferred costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has\n91\nindicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the ACC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. If future recovery of regulatory assets ceases to be probable or a disallowance becomes probable, it would result in a charge to earnings.\nWe identified Regulatory Accounting, specifically the impact of rate regulation on the financial statements, as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory rate orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets and/or a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes, and recent rate orders specific to APS and to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction. Management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential ACC-ordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the ACC, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the impact of rate regulation on the financial statements included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs of recently completed plant and costs deferred as regulatory assets and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to regulatory accounting, specifically the impact of rate regulation on the financial statements, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory rate orders issued by the ACC for APS and other public utilities in Arizona, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the ACC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory assets and liabilities for completeness.\n•\nWe observed the ACC Open Meeting during which the Recommended Order and Opinion regarding the 2022 Retail Rate Case was amended and approved and read the approved 2022 Rate Case Recommended Order and Opinion as amended. We obtained and evaluated management’s internally prepared analysis regarding impacts of the approved 2022 Rate Case Recommended Order and Opinion as amended to rates and recorded balances.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s assessment of the probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory orders or precedents set by the ACC under similar circumstances. We read the minutes of the Boards of\n92\nDirectors of the Company for discussions of changes in legal, regulatory, or business factors which could impact management’s assessment.\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nTempe, Arizona\nFebruary 27, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1932.\n93\nPINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.\n94\nPINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(dollars in thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.\n95\nPINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(dollars in thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.\n96\nPINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(dollars in thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.\n97\nPINNACLE\nWEST CAPITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(dollars in thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.\n98\nPINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n(a)\nPrimarily represents shares of common stock withheld from certain stock awards for tax purposes.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.\n99\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL\nOVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n(ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY)\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), for Arizona Public Service Company.  Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on our evaluation under the framework in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013),\nour management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein and also relates to the Company’s financial statements.\nFebruary 27, 2024\n100\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholder and the Board of Directors of\nArizona Public Service Company\nPhoenix, Arizona\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Arizona Public Service Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\n101\non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Accounting – Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements — Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Arizona Corporation Commission (the “ACC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates charged by public service utilities in Arizona. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; fuel and purchased power; operations and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.\nThe ACC’s rate-making policies are premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the ACC in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable deferred costs and\n102\nreturn on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the ACC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. If future recovery of regulatory assets ceases to be probable or a disallowance becomes probable, it would result in a charge to earnings.\nWe identified Regulatory Accounting, specifically the impact of rate regulation on the financial statements, as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory rate orders on the financial statements.

APS, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to substantially all of the state of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona.  APS accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so.  El Dorado is a wholly-owned subsidiary that invests in energy-related and Arizona community-based ventures.  PNW Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary that was created in September 2023 to hold certain investments in wind and transmission joint projects.  See Note 20 for more information on PNW Power.\nBCE was a Pinnacle West subsidiary that was formed in 2014.  On August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which all of our equity interest in BCE was sold. The sale was completed on January 12, 2024.  See Note 20 for more information relating to the sale of BCE.\nPinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries: APS, El Dorado, BCE and PNW Power.  APS’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of APS and certain VIEs relating to the Palo Verde sale leaseback.  Intercompany accounts and transactions between the consolidated companies have been eliminated.\nWe consolidate Variable Interest Entities (each a “VIE”) for which we are the primary beneficiary.  We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE through a qualitative analysis that identifies which variable interest holder has the controlling financial interest in the VIE.  In performing our primary beneficiary analysis, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including the design and activities of the VIE, the terms of the contracts the VIE has entered into, and which parties participated significantly in the design or redesign of the entity.  We continually evaluate our primary beneficiary conclusions to determine if changes have occurred which would impact our primary beneficiary assessments.  We have determined that APS is the primary beneficiary of certain VIE lessor trusts relating to the Palo Verde sale leaseback, and therefore APS consolidates these entities.  See Note 17 for additional information.  We have determined that Pinnacle West is the primary beneficiary of a captive insurance protected cell VIE.  As of December 31, 2023, the captive cell’s activities are insignificant to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise disclosed in the notes) that we believe are necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\nAccounting Records and Use of Estimates\nOur accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from\n111\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthose estimates.  To conform with the current year’s disaggregated presentation of significant changes in assets and liabilities and the aggregation of less significant changes in assets and liabilities, we made certain reclassifications for the year ended December 31, 2022, within the operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nRegulatory Accounting\nAPS is regulated by the ACC and the FERC.  The accompanying financial statements reflect the rate-making policies of these commissions.  As a result, we capitalize certain costs that would be included as expense in the current period by unregulated companies.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.\nManagement judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets and/or a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction.  This determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in Arizona and is subject to change in the future.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings.  Management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential commission-ordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities.\nSee Note 3 for additional information.\nElectric Revenues\nRevenues primarily consist of activities that are classified as revenues from contracts with customers.  Our electric revenues generally represent a single performance obligation delivered over time.  We have elected to apply the practical expedient that allows us to recognize revenue based on the amount to which we have a right to invoice for services performed.\nWe derive electric revenues primarily from sales of electricity to our regulated retail customers.  Revenues related to the sale of electricity are generally recognized when service is rendered or electricity is delivered to customers.  Unbilled revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue/kWh by customer class to the number of estimated kWhs delivered but not billed.  Differences historically between the actual and estimated unbilled revenues are immaterial.  We exclude sales taxes and franchise fees on electric revenues from both revenue and taxes other than income taxes.\nRevenues from our regulated retail customers and non-derivative instruments are reported on a gross basis on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income.  In the electricity business, some contracts to purchase electricity are netted against other contracts to sell electricity.  This is called a “book-out” and usually occurs for contracts that have the same terms (quantities, delivery points and delivery periods) and for which power does not flow.  We net these book-outs, which reduces both wholesale revenues and fuel and purchased power costs.\n112\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCertain cost recovery mechanisms may qualify as alternative revenue programs.  For alternative revenue programs that meet specified accounting criteria, we recognize revenues when the specific events permitting billing of the additional revenues have been completed.\nSee Notes 2 and 3 for additional information.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues that will ultimately be uncollectible due to credit loss risk.  The allowance includes a write-off component that is calculated by applying an estimated write-off factor to retail electric revenues.  The write-off factor used to estimate uncollectible accounts is based upon consideration of historical collections experience, the current and forecasted economic environment, changes to our collection policies, and management’s best estimate of future collections success.  See Note 2.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nUtility plant is the term we use to describe the business property and equipment that supports electric service, consisting primarily of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.  We report utility plant at its original cost, which includes:\n•\nmaterial and labor;\n•\ncontractor costs;\n•\ncapitalized leases;\n•\nconstruction overhead costs (where applicable); and\n•\nAFUDC.\nPinnacle West’s property, plant and equipment included in the December 31, 2023, and 2022 Consolidated Balance Sheets is composed of the following (dollars in thousands):\nProperty, plant and equipment balances and classes for APS are not materially different than Pinnacle West.\n113\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe expense the costs of plant outages, major maintenance and routine maintenance as incurred.  We charge retired utility plant to accumulated depreciation.  Liabilities associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets are recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized as part of the related tangible long-lived assets.  Accretion of the liability due to the passage of time is an operating expense, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset.  See Note 11 for additional information.\nAPS records a regulatory liability for the excess that has been recovered in regulated rates over the amount calculated in accordance with guidance on accounting for AROs.  APS believes it is probable it will recover in regulated rates, the costs calculated in accordance with this accounting guidance.\nWe record depreciation and amortization on utility plant on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful life of the related assets.  The approximate remaining average useful lives of our utility property at December 31, 2023, were as follows:\n•\nSteam generation —\n11\nyears;\n•\nNuclear plant —\n25\nyears;\n•\nOther generation —\n18\nyears;\n•\nTransmission —\n38\nyears;\n•\nDistribution —\n33\nyears; and\n•\nGeneral plant —\n7\nyears.\nDepreciation of utility property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line, remaining-life basis.\nDepreciation expense was $\n669\nmillion in 2023, $\n632\nmillion in 2022, and $\n575\nmillion in 2021.  For the years 2021 through 2023, the depreciation rates ranged from a low of\n1.37\n% to a high of\n12.15\n%.  The weighted-average depreciation rate was\n2.98\n% in 2023,\n3.03\n% in 2022, and\n2.87\n% in 2021.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAPS has AROs for its Palo Verde nuclear facilities and certain other generation assets.  The Palo Verde ARO primarily relates to final plant decommissioning.  This obligation is based on the NRC’s requirements for disposal of radiated property or plant and agreements APS reached with the ACC for final decommissioning of the plant.  The non-nuclear generation AROs primarily relate to requirements for removing portions of those plants at the end of the plant life or lease term and coal ash pond closures.  Some of APS’s transmission and distribution assets have AROs because they are subject to right of way and easement agreements that require final removal.  These agreements have a history of uninterrupted renewal that APS expects to continue.  As a result, APS cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the ARO related to such transmission and distribution assets.  Additionally, APS has aquifer protection permits for some of its generation sites that require the closure of certain facilities at those sites.\nSee Note 11 for further information on Asset Retirement Obligations.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction\nAFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds and an allowed return on the equity funds used for construction of regulated utility plant.  Both the debt and equity\n114\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncomponents of AFUDC are non-cash amounts within the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Plant construction costs, including AFUDC, are recovered in authorized rates through depreciation when completed projects are placed into commercial operation.\nAFUDC was calculated by using a composite rate of\n6.29\n% for 2023,\n5.75\n% for 2022, and\n6.75\n% for 2021.  APS compounds AFUDC semi-annually and ceases to accrue AFUDC when construction work is completed and the property is placed in service.\nOn June 30, 2020,\nFERC\nissued an order granting a waiver request related to the existing AFUDC rate calculation beginning March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021.  On February 23, 2021, this waiver was extended until September 30, 2021.  On September 21, 2021, it was further extended until March 31, 2022.  The order provided a simplified approach that companies may elect to implement in order to minimize the significant distorted effect on the AFUDC formula resulting from increased short-term debt financing during the COVID-19 pandemic.  APS adopted this simplified approach to computing the AFUDC composite rate by using a simple average of the actual historical short-term debt balances for 2019, instead of current period short-term debt balances, and left all other aspects of the AFUDC formula composite rate calculation unchanged.  This change impacted the AFUDC composite rate in 2021 and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022.  Furthermore, the change in the composite rate calculation did not impact our accounting treatment for these costs.  The change did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nMaterials and Supplies\nAPS values materials, supplies and fossil fuel inventory using a weighted-average cost method.  APS materials, supplies and fossil fuel inventories are carried at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value, unless evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost (even if in excess of market) will be recovered.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply recurring fair value measurements to cash equivalents, derivative instruments, investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trust and other special use funds.  On an annual basis, we apply fair value measurements to plan assets held in our retirement and other benefits plans.  Due to the short-term nature of short-term borrowings, the carrying values of these instruments approximate fair value.  Fair value measurements may also be applied on a nonrecurring basis to other assets and liabilities in certain circumstances such as impairments.  We also disclose fair value information for our long-term debt, which is carried at amortized cost.  See Note 6 for additional information.\nFair value is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market which we can access for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date.  Inputs to fair value may include observable and unobservable data.  We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nWe determine fair market value using observable inputs such as actively-quoted prices for identical instruments when available.  When actively-quoted prices are not available for the identical instruments, we use other observable inputs, such as prices for similar instruments, other corroborative market\n115\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ninformation, or prices provided by other external sources.  For options, long-term contracts, and other contracts for which observable price data are not available, we use models and other valuation methods, which may incorporate unobservable inputs to determine fair market value.\nThe use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market value often requires subjective and complex judgment.  Actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods.\nSee Note 12 for additional information about fair value measurements.\nDerivative Accounting\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas, coal and in interest rates.  We manage risks associated with market volatility by utilizing various physical and financial instruments including futures, forwards, options, and swaps.  As part of our overall risk management program, we may use derivative instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas as well as interest rate risk.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged transactions.  We also enter into derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes.  Contracts that have the same terms (quantities, delivery points and delivery periods) and for which power does not flow are netted, which reduces both revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income, but does not impact our financial condition, net income, or cash flows.\nWe account for our derivative contracts in accordance with derivatives and hedging guidance, which requires all derivatives not qualifying for a scope exception to be measured at fair value on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities.  Transactions with counterparties that have master netting arrangements are reported net on the balance sheet.\nSee Note 15 for additional information about our derivative instruments.\nLoss Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities\nPinnacle West and APS are involved in certain legal and environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business.  Contingent losses and environmental liabilities are recorded when it is determined that it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  When a range of the probable loss exists and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, Pinnacle West and APS record a loss contingency at the minimum amount in the range.  Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nRetirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\nPinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries, in addition to a non-qualified pension plan.  We also sponsor another postretirement benefit plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries that provides medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees.  Pension and other postretirement benefit expense are determined by actuarial valuations, based on assumptions that are evaluated annually.  See Note 7 for additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits.\n116\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNuclear Fuel\nAPS amortizes nuclear fuel by using the unit-of-production method.  The unit-of-production method is based on actual physical usage.  APS divides the cost of the fuel by the estimated number of thermal units it expects to produce with that fuel.  APS then multiplies that rate by the number of thermal units produced within the current period.  This calculation determines the current period nuclear fuel expense.\nAPS also charges nuclear fuel expense for the interim storage and permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  The DOE is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and charged APS $\n0.001\nper kWh of nuclear generation through May 2014, at which point the DOE reduced the fee to zero.  In accordance with a settlement agreement with the DOE in August 2014 for interim storage, we accrued a receivable and an offsetting regulatory liability through the settlement period ended December of 2023.\nSee Note 10 for information on spent nuclear fuel disposal costs.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided using the asset and liability approach prescribed by guidance relating to accounting for income taxes and are based on currently enacted tax rates.  We file our federal income tax return on a consolidated basis, and we file our state income tax returns on a consolidated or unitary basis.  In accordance with our intercompany tax sharing agreement, federal and state income taxes are allocated to each first-tier subsidiary as though each first-tier subsidiary filed a separate income tax return.  Any difference between that method and the consolidated (and unitary) income tax liability is attributed to the parent company.  The income tax accounts reflect the tax and interest associated with management’s estimate of the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than\n50\n% likely of being realized upon settlement for all known and measurable tax exposures.  See Note 4 for additional discussion.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at acquisition.\nThe following table summarizes supplemental Pinnacle West cash flow information for each of the last three years (dollars in thousands):\n117\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table summarizes supplemental APS cash flow information for each of the last three years (dollars in thousands):\nIntangible Assets\nWe have no goodwill recorded and have separately disclosed other intangible assets, primarily APS’s software, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The intangible assets are amortized over their finite useful lives.\nAmortization expense was $\n90\nmillion in 2023, $\n84\nmillion in 2022, and $\n80\nmillion in 2021.  Estimated amortization expense on existing intangible assets over the next five years is $\n90\nmillion in 2024, $\n75\nmillion in 2025, $\n49\nmillion in 2026, $\n23\nmillion in 2027, and $\n11\nmillion in 2028.  At December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining amortization period for intangible assets was\n5\nyears.\nInvestments\nEl Dorado holds investments in both debt and equity securities.  Investments in debt securities are generally accounted for as held-to-maturity and investments in equity securities are accounted for using either the equity method (if significant influence) or the measurement alternative for investments without readily determinable fair values (if less than\n20\n% ownership and no significant influence).\nPNW Power holds investments in equity securities.  Investments in equity securities are accounted for using either the equity method (if significant influence) or the measurement alternative for investments without readily determinable fair values (if less than\n20\n% ownership and no significant influence).\nOur investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, coal reclamation escrow accounts and active union employee medical account, are accounted for in accordance with guidance on accounting for investments in debt and equity securities.  See Notes 12 and 18 for more information on these investments.\nLeases\nWe determine if an agreement is a lease at contract inception.  A lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  To control the use of an identified asset an entity must have both a right to obtain substantially all of the benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset.  If we determine an agreement is a lease, and we are the lessee, we recognize a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the fixed lease payments over the lease term.  To present value lease liabilities we use the implicit rate in the lease if the information is readily available, otherwise we use our incremental borrowing rate determined at lease commencement.  Our incremental borrowing rate is based on the rate of interest we\n118\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nwould have to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.  When measuring right-of-use assets and lease liabilities we exclude variable lease payments, other than those that depend on an index or rate or are in-substance fixed payments.  For short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less, we do not recognize a right-of-use lease asset or lease liability.  We recognize operating lease expense using a straight-line pattern over the periods of use.\nAPS enters into purchased power contracts that may contain leases.  This occurs when a purchased power agreement designates a specific power plant or facility, APS obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the facility and has the right to direct the use of the facility.  Purchased power lease contracts may also include energy storage facilities.  Lease costs relating to purchased power lease contracts are reported in fuel and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Income and are subject to recovery under the PSA or RES.  See Note\n3\n.  We also may enter into lease agreements related to vehicles, office space, land, and other equipment.  See Note\n8\nfor information on our lease agreements.\nBusiness Segments\nPinnacle West’s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electricity service to Native Load customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.  All other segment activities are insignificant.\nPreferred Stock\nAt December 31, 2023, Pinnacle West had\n10\nmillion shares of serial preferred stock authorized with no par value,\nno\nne of which was outstanding, and APS had\n15,535,000\nshares of various types of preferred stock authorized with $\n25\n, $\n50\n, and $\n100\npar values,\nno\nne of which was outstanding.\n2.\nRevenue\nSources of Revenue\nThe following table provides detail of Pinnacle West’s consolidated revenue disaggregated by revenue sources (dollars in thousands):\n119\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRetail Electric Revenue.\nAll of Pinnacle West’s retail electric revenue is generated by APS.\nRetail electric revenue is generated by the sale of electricity to our regulated customers within the authorized service territory at tariff rates approved by the ACC and based on customer usage.\nRevenues related to the sale of electricity are generally recognized when service is rendered, or electricity is delivered to customers.\nThe billing of electricity sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters.\nWe obtain customers’ meter data on a systematic basis throughout the month, and generally bill customers within a month from when service was provided.\nCustomers are generally required to pay for services within 21 days of when the services are billed.\nSee “Allowance for Doubtful Accounts” discussion below for additional details regarding payment terms.\nWholesale Energy Sales and Transmission Services for Others.\nRevenues from wholesale energy sales and transmission services for others represent energy and transmission sales to wholesale customers.  These activities primarily consist of managing fuel and purchased power risks in connection with the cost of serving our retail customers’ energy requirements.  We may also sell into the wholesale markets generation that is not needed for APS’s retail load.  Our wholesale activities and tariff rates are regulated by FERC.\nRevenue Activities\nOur revenues primarily consist of activities that are classified as revenues from contracts with customers.  We derive our revenues from contracts with customers primarily from sales of electricity to our regulated retail customers.  Revenues from contracts with customers also include wholesale and transmission activities.  Our revenues from contracts with customers for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $\n4,651\nmillion, $\n4,302\nmillion, and $\n3,760\nmillion, respectively.\nWe have certain revenues that do not meet the specific accounting criteria to be classified as revenues from contracts with customers.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, our revenues that do not qualify as revenue from contracts with customers were $\n45\nmillion, $\n22\nmillion and $\n44\nmillion, respectively.  This amount includes revenues related to certain regulatory cost recovery mechanisms that are considered alternative revenue programs.  We recognize revenue associated with alternative revenue programs when specific events permitting recognition are completed.  Certain amounts associated with alternative revenue programs will subsequently be billed to customers; however, we do not reclassify billed amounts into revenue from contracts with customers.  See Note 3 for a discussion of our regulatory cost recovery mechanisms.\nContract Assets and Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\nThere were no material contract assets, contract liabilities, or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues that will ultimately be uncollectible due to credit loss risk.  The allowance includes a write-off component that is calculated by applying an estimated write-off factor to retail electric revenues.  The write-off factor used to estimate uncollectible accounts is based upon consideration of historical collections experience, the current and forecasted economic environment, changes to our\n120\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncollection policies, and management’s best estimate of future collections success.  We continue to monitor the impacts of our disconnection policies, payment arrangements, among other considerations impacting our estimated write-off factor, and allowance for doubtful accounts.\nThe following table provides a rollforward of Pinnacle West’s allowance for doubtful accounts (dollars in thousands):\n3.\nRegulatory Matters\n2022 Retail Rate Case\nAPS filed an application with the ACC on October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Rate Case”) seeking an increase in annual retail base rates on the date rates become effective (“Day 1”) of a net $\n460\nmillion.\nThis Day 1 net impact represents a total base revenue deficiency of $\n772\nmillion offset by proposed adjustor transfers of cost recovery to annual retail rates and adjustor mechanism modifications.\nThe average annual customer bill impact of APS’s request on Day 1 is an increase of\n13.6\n%.\nThe principal provisions of APS’s application were:\n•\na test year comprised of twelve months ended June 30, 2022, adjusted as described below;\n•\nan original cost rate base of $\n10.5\nbillion, which approximates the ACC-jurisdictional portion of the book value of utility assets, net of accumulated depreciation and other credits;\n•\nthe following proposed capital structure and costs of capital:\n•\na 1% return on the increment of fair value rate base above APS’s original cost rate base, as provided for by Arizona law;\n•\na rate of $\n0.038321\nper kWh for the portion of APS’s retail base rates attributable to fuel and purchased power costs (“Base Fuel Rate”);\n•\nmodification of its adjustment mechanisms including:\n▪\neliminate the Environmental Improvement Surcharge (“EIS”) and collect costs through base rates,\n▪\neliminate the Lost Fixed Cost Recovery (“LFCR”) mechanism and collect costs through base rates and the Demand Side Management Adjustment Charge (“DSMAC”),\n121\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n▪\nmaintain as inactive the Tax Expense Adjustor Mechanism (“TEAM”),\n▪\nmaintain the Transmission Cost Adjustment (“TCA”) mechanism,\n▪\nmodify the performance incentive in the DSMAC, and\n▪\nmodify the Renewable Energy Adjustment Charge (“REAC”) to include recovery of capital carrying costs of APS owned renewable and storage resources;\n•\nchanges to its limited-income program, including a second tier to provide an additional discount for customers with greater need; and\n•\ntwelve months of post-Test Year plant investments to reflect used and useful projects that will be placed into service prior to July 1, 2023.\nOn June 5, 2023, and June 15, 2023, the ACC Staff, the Residential Utility Consumer Office (“RUCO”) and other intervenors filed their initial written testimony with the ACC.\nThe ACC Staff recommends, among other things, (i) a $\n251\nmillion revenue increase or, as an alternative, a $\n312\nmillion revenue increase, (ii) a\n9.6\n% return on equity, (iii) a\n0.0\n% fair value increment or, as an alternative, a\n0.75\n% fair value increment, and (iv) a continuation of a 12-month post-test year plant.\nRUCO recommends, among other things, (i) an $\n84.9\nmillion revenue increase, (ii) an\n8.2\n% return on equity or, as an alternative, an\n8.7\n% return on equity if the ACC imputes a hypothetical capital structure with a\n46\n% equity layer, (iii) a fair value increment of\n0.0\n%, and (iv) a reduction of post-test year plant to six months.\nOn July 12, 2023, APS filed rebuttal testimony addressing the ACC Staff and intervenors’ direct testimonies.\nThe principal provisions of APS’s rebuttal testimony are:\n•\nreducing the revenue requirement increase to $\n383.1\nmillion, which reduced the average annual customer bill impact to an increase of\n11.3\n%;\n•\nmaintaining a return on equity request of\n10.25\n%;\n•\nreducing the increment of fair value rate base return to\n0.5\n% from\n1.0\n%;\n•\nmaintaining a post-test year plant request of 12 months, plus the Four Corners Effluent Limitation Guidelines (“ELG”) project;\n•\nwithdrawing the Payment Fee Removal Proposal (net reduction) which was originally requested in APS’s initial application;\n•\nmaintaining the LFCR mechanism and DSMAC as separate adjustors;\n•\nincreasing the Power Supply Adjustment (“PSA”) annual rate change limit from $\n0.004\n/kWh to $\n0.006\n/kWh;\n•\nproposing a new System Reliability Benefit (“SRB”) recovery mechanism;\n•\nmaintaining the REAC in its current state;\n•\nmaintaining adjustor base transfers and elimination of EIS; and\n•\nmaintaining the request to recover Coal Community Transition (“CCT”) funding.\nOn July 26, 2023, the ACC Staff, RUCO and other intervenors filed their surrebuttal testimony with the ACC.\nThe ACC Staff adjusted their initial recommendations to, among other things, (i) a $\n281.9\nmillion revenue increase, (ii) a\n9.68\n% return on equity, (iii) a\n0.5\n% fair value increment, (iv) a continuation of a 12-month post-test year plant that includes the Four Corners ELG project, and (v) support of an increase to the annual PSA increase limit to $\n0.006\n/kWh.\nRUCO maintained their direct position and also recommended further review of the PSA in a second phase of the 2022 Rate Case.\n122\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn August 4, 2023, APS filed rejoinder testimony addressing the ACC Staff and intervenors’ surrebuttal testimonies.\nAPS’s rejoinder testimony included final post-Test Year Plant values, reducing the revenue requirement increase to $\n377.7\nmillion from $\n383.1\nmillion, which reduced the average annual customer bill impact to an increase of\n11.2\n%.\nAll other major provisions from APS’s rebuttal testimony were maintained in its rejoinder testimony.\nOn November 6, 2023, and November 21, 2023, APS and stakeholders filed briefs in the 2022 Rate Case.  APS’s briefs included the reduction of the total revenue requirement increase to $\n376.2\nmillion and a resulting average annual customer bill impact increase of\n11.1\n%.  All other major provisions from APS’s rejoinder testimony were maintained in its briefs.  ACC Staff’s briefs included a proposed total revenue requirement increase from $\n281.9\nmillion to $\n282.7\nmillion and also included their support of APS’s SRB mechanism, contingent on increased stakeholder outreach.\nOn January 25, 2024, an Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Opinion and Order in the 2022 Rate Case, as corrected on February 6, 2024 (the “2022 Rate Case ROO”).  The 2022 Rate Case ROO recommended, among other things, (i) a $\n523.1\nmillion increase in the annual base rate revenue requirement, (ii) a\n9.55\n% return on equity, (iii) a\n0.25\n% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of\n4.36\n%, (v) 12 months of post-test year plant and the inclusion of the Four Corners ELG project, (vi) the approval of APS’s SRB proposal with certain procedural and other modifications, (vii) no additional CCT funding, (viii) a\n5.0\n% return on the prepaid pension asset and a return of\n5.35\n% on the OPEB liability, and (ix) no disallowances on APS’s coal contracts.\nThe 2022 Rate Case ROO also recommended a number of changes to existing adjustors, including (i) the approval of modified DSM performance incentives and the requested DSM transfer to base rates, (ii) the retention of $\n1.9\nmillion of REAC in the adjustor rather than base rates, (iii) a partial transfer of $\n27.1\nmillion of LFCR funds to base rates, and (iv) the adoption of an increase in the annual PSA cap to $\n0.006\n/kWh.\nOn February 22, 2024, the ACC approved a number of amendments to the 2022 Rate Case ROO that resulted in, among other things, (i) an approximately $\n491.7\nmillion increase in the annual base revenue requirement, (ii) a\n9.55\n% return on equity, (iii) a\n0.25\n% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of\n4.39\n%, (v) a return set at the Company’s weighted average cost of capital on the net prepaid pension asset and net other post-employment benefit liability in rate base, (vi) an adjustment to generation maintenance and outage expense to reflect a more reasonable level of test year costs, (vii) approval of the SRB mechanism with modifications to customer notifications, procedural timelines and the inclusion of any qualifying technology and fuel source bid received through an all-source request for proposal (“RFP”), and (viii) recovery of all DSM costs through the DSMAC rather than through base rates.\nThe ACC’s decision results in an expected total net annual revenue increase for APS of approximately $\n253.4\nmillion and a roughly\n8\n% increase to the typical residential customer’s bill.  The ACC is expected to issue the final order for the 2022 Rate Case in March 2024 with the new rates to become effective for all service rendered on or after March 8, 2024.\n123\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2019 Retail Rate Case\nOn October 31, 2019, APS filed an application with the ACC for an annual increase in retail base rates (the “2019 Rate Case”).\nOn August 2, 2021, an Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Opinion and Order in the 2019 Rate Case (the “2019 Rate Case ROO”) and issued corrections on September 10 and September 20, 2021.\nThe 2019 Rate Case ROO recommended, among other things, (i) a $\n111\nmillion decrease in annual revenue requirements, (ii) a return on equity of\n9.16\n%, (iii) a\n0.30\n% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, with total fair value rate of return further adjusted to include a\n0.03\n% reduction to return on equity resulting in an effective fair value rate of return of\n4.95\n%, (iv) the nonrecovery of the deferral and rate base effects of the operating costs and construction of the Four Corners Power Plant (“Four Corners”) selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) project (see “Four Corners SCR Cost Recovery” below for additional in\nformation),\n(v) the recovery of the deferral and rate base effects of the operating costs and construction of the Ocotillo modernization project, which includes a reduction in the return on the deferral, (vi) a\n15\n% disallowance of annual amortization of the Navajo Generating Station (the “Navajo Plant”) regulatory asset recovery related to the closure of the Navajo Plant (see “Navajo Plant” below), (vii) the denial of the request to defer, until APS’s next general rate case, the increase or decrease in its Arizona property taxes attributable to tax rate changes, and (viii) a collaborative process to review and recommend revisions to APS’s adjustment mechanisms within 12 months after the date of the decision.\nThe 2019 Rate Case ROO also recommended that the CCT plan related to the closure or future closure of coal-fired generation facilities include the following components: (i) $\n50\nmillion that will be paid over\n10\nyears to the Navajo Nation, (ii) $\n5\nmillion that will be paid over\nfive years\nto the Navajo County Communities surrounding Cholla Power Plant (“Cholla”), and (iii) $\n1.675\nmillion that will be paid to the Hopi Tribe related to APS’s ownership interests in the Navajo Plant.\nThese amounts would be recoverable from APS’s customers through the Arizona Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (“RES”) adjustment mechanism.\nAPS filed exceptions on September 13, 2021, regarding the disallowance of the SCR cost deferrals and plant investments that was recommended in the 2019 Rate Case ROO, among other issues.\nOn October 6, 2021, and October 27, 2021, the ACC voted on various amendments to the 2019 Rate Case ROO that would result in, among other things, (i) a return on equity of\n8.70\n%, which includes a\n20\n-basis point penalty, (ii) the recovery of the deferral and rate base effects of the operating costs and construction of the Four Corners SCR project, with the exception of $\n215.5\nmillion (see “Four Corners SCR Cost Recovery” below), (iii) that the CCT plan include the following components: (a) a payment of $\n1\nmillion to the Hopi Tribe within\n60\ndays of the 2019 Rate Case decision, (b) a payment of $\n10\nmillion over\nthree years\nto the Navajo Nation, (c) a payment of $\n0.5\nmillion to the Navajo County communities within\n60\ndays of the 2019 Rate Case decision, (d) up to $\n1.25\nmillion for electrification of homes and businesses on the Hopi reservation, and (e) up to $\n1.25\nmillion for the electrification of homes and businesses on the Navajo Nation reservation.\nThese payments and expenditures are attributable to the future closures of Four Corners and Cholla, along with the prior closure of the Navajo Plant and all ordered payments and expenditures would be recoverable through rates, and (iv) a change in the residential on-peak time-of-use period from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. to 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.\nThe 2019 Rate Case ROO, as amended, resulted in a total annual revenue decrease for APS of $\n4.8\nmillion, excluding temporary payments and expenditures, under the CCT plan.\nOn November 2, 2021, the ACC approved the 2019 Rate Case ROO, as amended.\n124\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConsistent with the 2019 Rate Case decision, APS implemented the new rates effective as of\nDecember 1, 2021.\nIn addition, the ACC ordered extensive compliance and reporting obligations.\nAPS completed the implementation of the new on-peak hours for residential customers before the September 1, 2022, deadline.\nAdditionally, consistent with the 2019 Rate Case decision, as of February 2024, APS completed the following payments that will be recoverable through rates related to the CCT: (i) $\n6.66\nmillion to the Navajo Nation; (ii) $\n0.5\nmillion to the Navajo County communities; and (iii) $\n1\nmillion to the Hopi Tribe.\nConsistent with APS’s commitment to the impacted communities, APS has also completed the following payments:\n(i) $\n1\nmillion to the Navajo Nation for CCT; (ii) $\n1.1\nmillion to the Navajo County communities for CCT and economic development; and (iii) $\n1.25\nmillion to the Hopi Tribe for CCT and economic development.\nThe ACC has also authorized $\n1.25\nmillion to be recovered through rates for electrification of homes and businesses on both the Navajo Nation and Hopi reservation.\nExpenditure of the recoverable funds for electrification of homes and businesses on the Navajo Nation\nand the Hopi reservations is contingent upon completion of a census of the unelectrified homes and businesses in each that are also within APS service territory.\nThe census work was completed in November 2022 and disbursement of the $\n1.25\nmillion for electrification of homes and businesses is planned to be finalized after discussions with the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe are completed.  On February 22, 2024, the ACC voted to not approve any further CCT funding.\nOn November 24, 2021, APS filed an application for rehearing of the 2019 Rate Case with the ACC and the application was deemed denied on December 15, 2021, as the ACC did not act upon it.\nOn\nDecember 17, 2021, APS filed its Notice of Direct Appeal at the Arizona Court of Appeals and a Petition for Special Action with the Arizona Supreme Court, requesting review of the disallowance of $\n215.5\nmillion of Four Corners SCR plant investments and deferrals (see “Four Corners SCR Cost Recovery” below for additional information) and the\n20\n-basis-point penalty reduction to the return on equity, among other things.\nOn February 8, 2022, the Arizona Supreme Court declined to accept jurisdiction on APS’s Petition for Special Action.\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on November 30, 2022.\nOn March 6, 2023, the Court issued its opinion in this matter, affirming in part and reversing in part the ACC’s decision in the 2019 Rate Case.\nThe Court vacated the\n20\n-basis-point penalty included in the ACC’s allowed return on equity, as the Court determined the use of customer service metrics to justify the reduction exceeded the ACC’s ratemaking authority.\nAdditionally, the Court vacated the disallowance of\n$\n215.5\nmillion\nof APS’s Four Corners SCR investment.\nThe Court remanded the issue to the ACC for further proceedings.\nThe ACC requested an extension of the 30-day deadline to appeal the matter to the Arizona Supreme Court, and the Arizona Supreme Court granted the extension of the deadline to May 8, 2023.\nThe ACC filed an appeal on May 8, 2023, and on May 15, 2023, requested a suspension of the case to allow for settlement discussions between the parties, which was approved by the Court.\nOn June 14, 2023, APS and the ACC Legal Division filed a joint resolution with the ACC to allow recovery of the $\n215.5\nmillion in costs related to the installation of the Four Corners SCR, a reversal of the\n20\n-basis point reduction to APS’s return on equity from\n8.9\n% to\n8.7\n% as a result of the 2019 Rate Case Decision, and recovery of $\n59.6\nmillion in revenue lost by APS between December of 2021 and June 20, 2023.\nOn June 21, 2023, the ACC approved the joint resolution and proposals therein for recovery through the Court Resolution Surcharge (“CRS”) mechanism, which became effective on July 1, 2023.\nSee “Court Resolution Surcharge” below for more information.\nOn July 18, 2023, the Sierra Club filed an application for rehearing of the ACC’s decision.\nHowever,\nt\nhe ACC did not act upon the application within 20 days,\n125\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nand it was therefore denied by operation of law.\nSubsequently, the Sierra Club did not file a notice of appeal to the Arizona Court of Appeals, and the time for an appeal has expired.\nMatter of Impact of the Closures of Fossil-Based Generation Plan on Impacted Communities\nOn September 28, 2022, ACC Staff filed their staff report in the Matter of Impact of the Closures of Fossil-Based Generation Plan on Impacted Communities.\nAPS and other interested parties filed comments on the report.\nOn October 21, 2022, ACC Staff filed a revised report and proposed order.\nThe revised report and proposed order recommended that funds for CCT shall not be collected from rate payers.\nOn December 8, 2022, the ACC voted against ACC Staff’s proposed order, and on April 17, 2023, the ACC closed the docket.\nOn February 22, 2024, the ACC voted to not approve any further CCT funding.\nInformation Technology ACC Investigation\nOn December 16, 2021, the ACC opened an investigation into various matters related to APS’s Information Technology department, including information about technology projects, costs, vendor management leadership and decision making.\nAPS is cooperating with the investigation.\nAPS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nRegulatory Lag Docket\nOn January 5, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to explore the possibility of modifications to the ACC’s historical test year rules.  The ACC requested comments from utilities and interested parties on ways to reduce regulatory lag, including alternative ratemaking structures such as future test years and hybrid test years.  APS filed comments on June 1, 2023.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nCost Recovery Mechanisms\nAPS has received regulatory decisions that allow for more timely recovery of certain costs outside of a general retail rate case through the following recovery mechanisms.\nSee “2022 Retail Rate Case”\nabove for modifications of adjustment mechanisms in the 2022 Rate Case.\nRenewable Energy Standard\n.\nIn 2006, the ACC approved the RES.  Under the RES, electric utilities that are regulated by the ACC must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources, including solar, wind, biomass, biogas and geothermal technologies.  In order to achieve these requirements, the ACC allows APS to include a RES surcharge as part of customer bills to recover the approved amounts for use on renewable energy projects.  Each year, APS is required to file a\nfive-year\nimplementation plan with the ACC and seek approval for funding the upcoming year’s RES budget.\nIn 2015, the ACC revised the RES rules to allow the ACC to consider all available information, including the number of rooftop solar arrays in a utility’s service territory, to determine compliance with the RES.\nIn June 2021, the ACC adopted a clean energy rules package which would require APS to meet certain clean energy standards and technology procurement mandates, obtain approval for its action plan included in its IRP, and seek cost recovery in a rate process.\nSince the adopted clean energy rules differed substantially from the original Recommended Order and Opinion, supplemental rulemaking procedures were required before the rules could become effective.\nOn January 26, 2022, the ACC reversed its prior\n126\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ndecision and declined to send the final draft energy rules through the rulemaking process.\nInstead, the ACC opened a new docket to consider all-source RFP requirements and the IRP process.\nSee “Energy Modernization Plan” below for more information.\nOn July 1, 2021, APS filed its 2022 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $\n93.1\nmillion.\nAPS filed an amended 2022 RES Implementation Plan on December 9, 2021, with a proposed budget of $\n100.5\nmillion.\nThis budget included funding for programs to comply with the decision in the 2019 Rate Case, including the ACC authorizing spending $\n20\nmillion to $\n30\nmillion in capital costs for the continuation of the APS Solar Communities program each year for a period of\nthree years\nfrom the effective date of the 2019 Rate Case decision.\nAPS’s budget proposal supported existing approved projects and commitments and requested a waiver of the RES residential and non-residential distributed energy requirements for 2022.\nOn May 18, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 RES Implementation Plan, including an amendment requiring a stakeholder working group convene to develop a community solar program for the ACC’s consideration at a future date.\nOn September 23, 2022, APS filed a community solar proposal in compliance with the ACC order that was informed by a stakeholder working group.\nAPS proposed a small, pilot-scale program size of up to\n140\nMW that would be selected through a competitive RFP.\nThe ACC has not yet ruled on the proposal.\nHowever, on November 10, 2022, the ACC approved a bifurcated community solar process, directing ACC Staff to develop a statewide policy through additional stakeholder involvement and establishing a separate evidentiary hearing to define other policy components.\nOn March 23, 2023, the ACC approved a policy statement that included information on how statewide community solar and storage programs should be structured, their location, and inclusion in RFPs.\nThe remainder of the community solar program policy components were deferred to the ACC’s Hearing Division so that a formal evidentiary hearing could be held to consider issues of substance related to community solar.\nAPS cannot predict the outcomes of these future activities.\nOn July 1, 2022, APS filed its 2023 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $\n86.2\nmillion, excluding any funding offsets.\nThis budget contained funding for programs to comply with ACC-approved initiatives, including the 2019 Rate Case decision.\nAPS’s budget proposal supported existing approved projects and commitments and requested a waiver of the RES residential and non-residential distributed energy requirements for 2022.\nOn November 10, 2022, the ACC approved the 2023 RES Implementation Plan, including APS’s requested waiver of the distributed energy requirement for 2023.\nOn June 30, 2023, APS filed its 2024 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $\n95.1\nmillion.\nAPS’s budget proposal supports existing approved projects and commitments and requests a waiver of the RES renewable energy credit requirements to demonstrate compliance with the Annual Renewable Energy Requirement for 2023.\nThe ACC has not yet ruled on the 2024 RES Implementation Plan.\nDemand Side Management Adjustor Charge\n.\nThe ACC Electric Energy Efficiency Standards require APS to submit a DSM Plan annually for review and approval by the ACC.\nVerified energy savings from APS’s resource savings projects can be counted toward compliance with the Electric Energy Efficiency Standards; however, APS is not allowed to count savings from systems savings projects toward determination of the achievement of performance incentives, nor may APS include savings from these system savings projects in the calculation of its LFCR mechanism.\nSee below for discussion of the LFCR.\n127\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn December 17, 2021, APS filed\nits 2022 D\nSM Implementation Plan in accordance with an extension granted in 2021.  The 2022 DSM Plan requested a budget of\n$\n78.4\nmillion and represents an increase of approximately $\n14\nmillion in DSM spending above 2021.\nOn November 10, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 DSM Implementation Plan, including a proposed performance incentive.\nOn June 1, 2022, APS filed its 2023 Transportation Electrification Plan (“2023 TE Plan”).  The 2023 TE Plan detailed APS’s efforts to grow and support transportation electrification in Arizona, including the Take Charge AZ Pilot Program and customer education and outreach related to transportation electrification.  Subsequently, APS filed an amended 2023 TE Plan on November 30, 2022, that included a request for a $\n5\nmillion budget.  On December 12, 2023, the ACC approved the 2023 TE Plan without including the Take Charge AZ Program and its budget going forward, but allowed APS to complete projects already underway.  Additionally, the ACC discontinued the residential EV SmartCharger rebate and approved modifications to the EV rate plan.\nOn November 30, 2022, APS filed its 2023 DSM Implementation Plan, which requested a budget of $\n88\nmillion.\nOn May 31, 2023, APS filed an amended 2023 DSM Implementation Plan.\nThe amended plan maintained the originally proposed budget of\n$\n88\nmillion.  Subsequent to filing the amended 2023 DSM Implementation Plan and prior to the ACC approving it, on November 30, 2023, APS filed its 2024 DSM Implementation Plan.  The 2024 DSM Implementation Plan requested a total budget of $\n91.5\nmillion and incorporated all elements of the amended 2023 DSM Implementation Plan as well as the 2024 TE Implementation Plan.  The ACC has not yet ruled on the 2024 DSM Implementation Plan.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\nPower Supply Adjustor Mechanism and Balance.\nThe PSA provides for the adjustment of retail rates to reflect variations primarily in retail fuel and purchased power costs.  The PSA is subject to specified parameters and procedures, including the following:\n•\nAPS records deferrals for recovery or refund to the extent actual retail fuel and purchased power costs vary from the Base Fuel Rate;\n•\nan adjustment to the PSA rate is made annually each February 1 (unless otherwise approved by the ACC) and goes into effect automatically unless suspended by the ACC;\n•\nthe PSA uses a forward-looking estimate of fuel and purchased power costs to set the annual PSA rate, which is reconciled to actual costs experienced for each PSA Year (February 1 through January 31) (see the following bullet point);\n•\nthe PSA rate includes (a) a “forward component,” under which APS recovers or refunds differences between expected fuel and purchased power costs for the upcoming calendar year and those embedded in the Base Fuel Rate; (b) a “historical component,” under which differences between actual fuel and purchased power costs and those recovered or refunded through the combination of the Base Fuel Rate and the Forward Component are recovered during the next PSA Year; and (c) a “transition component,” under which APS may seek mid-year PSA changes due to large variances between actual fuel and purchased power costs and the combination of the Base Fuel Rate and the Forward Component; and\n•\nthe PSA rate may not be increased or decreased more than $\n0.004\nper kWh in a year without permission of the ACC.\n128\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows the changes in the deferred fuel and purchased power regulatory asset for 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands):\nOn November 30, 2021, APS filed its PSA rate for the PSA year beginning February 1, 2022.\nThat rate was $\n0.007544\nper kWh, which consisted of a forward component of $(\n0.004842\n) per kWh and a historical component of $\n0.012386\nper kWh.\nThe 2022 PSA rate was a $\n0.004\nper kWh increase compared to the 2021 PSA year, which is the maximum permitted under the Plan of Administration for the PSA.\nThese rates went into effect as filed on February 1, 2022.\nOn April 1, 2022, the ACC filed a final report of its third-party audit findings regarding APS’s fuel and purchased power costs for the period January 2019 through January 2021.\nThe report contains an in-depth review of APS’s fuel and purchased power contracts, its monthly fuel accounting activities, its forecasting and dispatching procedures, and its monthly PSA filings, among other fuel-related activities.\nThe report finds that APS’s fuel processing accounting practices, dispatching procedures, and procedures for hedging activity are reasonable and appropriate.\nThe report includes several recommendations for the ACC’s consideration, including review of current contracts, maintenance schedules, and certain changes and improvements to the schedules in APS’s monthly PSA filings.\nOn December 27, 2022, ACC Staff filed a proposed order supporting adoption of the recommendations in the third-party audit report, and the ACC approved the proposed order on February 22, 2023.\nOn November 30, 2022, APS filed its PSA rate for the PSA year beginning February 1, 2023.\nTo address the growing under-collected PSA balance, APS also requested that one of three different options be adopted, including a temporary or permanent increase of the annual cap to $\n0.006\nper kWh.\nOn     February 23, 2023, the ACC approved an overall PSA rate of $\n0.019074\nper kWh, which consisted of a forward component of $(\n0.005527\n) per kWh, a historical component of $\n0.013071\nper kWh and a transition component of $\n0.011530\nper kWh, that will continue until further notice of the ACC.\nThe rate became effective with the first billing cycle in March 2023 and is designed to bring the PSA balancing account to near-zero over a\n24\n-month period.\nAPS is also required to notify the ACC when the PSA balancing account approaches $\n0.5\nmillion.\nIn its 2022 Rate Case, APS proposed a permanent increase in the annual PSA adjustor rate cap, which would increase the amount the rate can change in any given year from the currently effective $\n0.004\nper kWh to $\n0.006\nper kWh.\nOn February 22, 2024, the ACC voted to approve this request.\nOn November 30, 2023, APS notified the ACC that it will be maintaining the current PSA rate of $\n0.019074\nper kWh and an updated PSA adjustment schedule would not be filed at this time.\nIn accordance with the PSA Plan of Administration, APS is required to seek ACC approval to recover costs related to third-party energy storage systems through its PSA adjustment mechanism.\nIn\n129\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2023,\nnine\nenergy storage PPAs and their respective costs have been approved for recovery through the PSA.  In 2022,\none\nenergy storage PPA and its costs was approved for recovery through the PSA.  In 2021,\nfour\nenergy storage PPAs and their respective costs were approved for recovery through the PSA. However,\none\nenergy storage PPA that was approved in 2021 was later terminated by APS due to project delays.\nEnvironmental Improvement Surcharge (“EIS”).\nThe EIS permits APS to recover the capital carrying costs (rate of return, depreciation and taxes) plus incremental operations and maintenance expenses associated with environmental improvements made outside of a test year to comply with environmental standards set by federal, state, tribal, or local laws and regulations.  A filing is made on or before February 1 each year for qualified environmental improvements since the prior rate case test year, and the new charge becomes effective April 1 unless suspended by the ACC.  The EIS includes an overall cap of $\n0.0005\nper kWh (approximately $\n13\nmillion to $\n15\nmillion per year).  APS’s February 1, 2023, application requested an increase in the charge to $\n14.7\nmillion, or $\n3.3\nmillion over the prior-period charge.\nOn March 10, 2023, APS filed an amended application requesting an EIS charge of $\n4.0\nmillion, a decrease of $\n10.7\nmillion from the February EIS request, and a decrease of $\n7.5\nmillion from the prior-period charge.\nThe revised 2023 EIS became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2023.  On February 1, 2024, APS filed an application requesting an increase in the charge to $\n15.3\nmillion, or $\n11.3\nmillion over the prior-period charge.  The 2022 Rate Case ROO has recommended eliminating the EIS.  On February 22, 2024, the ACC approved the elimination of the EIS as recommended in the 2022 Rate Case ROO.  With the elimination of the EIS, the surcharge will no longer be in effect.\nTransmission Rates, Transmission Cost Adjustor and Other Transmission Matters\n.\nIn July 2008, FERC approved a modification to APS’s Open Access Transmission Tariff to allow APS to move from fixed rates to a formula rate-setting methodology in order to more accurately reflect and recover the costs that APS incurs in providing transmission services.  A large portion of the rate represents charges for transmission services to serve APS’s retail customers (“Retail Transmission Charges”).  In order to recover the Retail Transmission Charges, APS was previously required to file an application with, and obtain approval from, the ACC to reflect changes in Retail Transmission Charges through the TCA.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement entered into in 2012 regarding APS’s rate case (“2012 Settlement Agreement”), however, an adjustment to rates to recover the Retail Transmission Charges will be made annually each June 1 and will go into effect automatically unless suspended by the ACC.\nThe formula rate is updated each year effective June 1 on the basis of APS’s actual cost of service, as disclosed in APS’s FERC Form 1 report for the previous fiscal year.  Items to be updated include actual capital expenditures made as compared with previous projections, transmission revenue credits and other items.  APS reviews the proposed formula rate filing amounts with the ACC Staff.  Any items or adjustments which are not agreed to by APS and the ACC Staff can remain in dispute until settled or litigated with FERC.  Settlement or litigated resolution of disputed issues could require an extended period of time and could have a significant effect on the Retail Transmission Charges because any adjustment, though applied prospectively, may be calculated to account for previously over- or under-collected amounts.\nThe resolution of proposed adjustments can result in significant volatility in the revenues to be collected.\nOn March 17, 2020, APS submitted a filing to make modifications to its annual transmission formula to provide additional transparency for excess and deficient accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act (the “Tax Act”), as well as for future local, state, and federal\n130\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nstatutory tax rate changes.\nAPS amended its March 17, 2020, filing on April 28, 2020, September 29, 2021, and October 27, 2021.\nIn January 2022, FERC approved APS’s modifications to its annual transmission formula.\nEffective June 1, 2021, APS’s annual wholesale transmission revenue requirement for all users of its transmission system increased by approximately $\n4\nmillion for the 12-month period beginning June 1, 2021, in accordance with the FERC-approved formula.\nOf this net amount, wholesale customer rates decreased by approximately $\n3.2\nmillion and retail customer rates would have increased by approximately $\n7.2\nmillion.\nHowever, since changes in Retail Transmission Charges are reflected through the TCA after consideration of transmission recovery in retail base rates and the ACC-approved balancing account, the retail revenue requirement decreased by $\n28.4\nmillion, resulting in reductions to both residential and commercial rates.\nAn adjustment to APS’s retail rates to recover FERC-approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2021.\nEffective June 1, 2022, APS’s annual wholesale transmission revenue requirement for all users of its transmission system decreased by approximately $\n33\nmillion for the 12-month period beginning June 1, 2022, in accordance with the FERC-approved formula.\nOf this net amount, wholesale customer rates decreased by approximately $\n6.4\nmillion and retail customer rates would have decreased by approximately $\n26.6\nmillion.\nHowever, since changes in Retail Transmission Charges are reflected through the TCA after consideration of transmission recovery in retail base rates and the ACC approved balancing account, the retail revenue requirement decreased by $\n2.4\nmillion, resulting in a reduction to the residential rate and increases to commercial rates.\nAn adjustment to APS’s retail rates to recover FERC-approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2022.\nEffective June 1, 2023, APS’s annual wholesale transmission revenue requirement for all users of its transmission system increased by approximately $\n34.7\nmillion for the 12-month period beginning    June 1, 2023, in accordance with the FERC-approved formula.\nOf this net amount, wholesale customer rates increased by approximately $\n20.7\nmillion and retail customer rates would have increased by approximately $\n14\nmillion.\nHowever, since changes in Retail Transmission Charges are reflected through the TCA after consideration of transmission recovery in retail base rates and the ACC approved balancing account, the retail revenue requirement decreased by $\n10\nmillion, resulting in reductions to the residential and commercial rates.\nAn adjustment to APS’s retail rates to recover FERC-approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2023.\nLost Fixed Cost Recovery Mechanism\n.\nThe LFCR mechanism permits APS to recover on an after-the-fact basis a portion of its fixed costs that would otherwise have been collected by APS in the kWh sales lost due to APS energy efficiency programs and to DG such as rooftop solar arrays.  The fixed costs recoverable by the LFCR mechanism were\n2.50\ncents for both lost residential and non-residential kWh as set forth in the settlement agreement in the 2017 rate case (the “2017 Settlement Agreement”).\nThe fixed costs recoverable by the LFCR mechanism are currently\n2.56\ncents for lost residential kWh and\n2.68\ncents for lost non-residential kWh as set forth in the 2019 Rate Case decision.\nThe adjustment to the LFCR has a year-over-year cap of\n1\n% of retail revenues.  Any amounts left unrecovered in a particular year because of this cap can be carried over for recovery in a future year.  The kWhs lost from energy efficiency are based on a third-party evaluation of APS’s energy efficiency programs.  DG sales losses are determined from the metered output from the DG units.\n131\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn February 15, 2021, APS filed its 2021 annual LFCR adjustment, requesting that effective    May 1, 2021, the annual LFCR recovery amount be increased to $\n38.5\nmillion (an $\n11.8\nmillion increase from previous levels).\nOn April 13, 2021, the ACC voted not to approve the requested $\n11.8\nmillion increase to the annual LFCR adjustment; thus, the previously approved rates continued to remain intact and the $\n11.8\nmillion increase was reflected in APS’s 2022 filing in accordance with the compliance requirements.\nAs a result of the 2019 Rate Case decision, APS’s annual LFCR adjustor rate will be dependent on an annual earnings test filing, which will compare APS’s previous year’s rate of return with the related authorized rate of return.\nIf the actual rate of return is higher than the authorized rate of return, the LFCR rate for the subsequent year is set at zero.\nAPS determined that the changes to the LFCR mechanism, as a result of the 2019 Rate Case decision effective on December 1, 2021, did not materially impact its results of operations and financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nHowever, as a result of certain changes made to the LFCR mechanism in the 2019 Rate Case decision, the mechanism no longer qualified for alternative revenue program accounting treatment, which impacts the future timing of related revenue recognition.\nOn February 15, 2022, APS filed its 2022 annual LFCR adjustment, requesting that effective    May 1, 2022, the annual LFCR recovery amount be increased to $\n59.1\nmillion (a $\n32.5\nmillion increase from previous levels, which was inclusive of the $\n11.8\nmillion balance from the 2021 filing).\nOn May 9, 2022, the ACC Staff filed its revised report and proposed order regarding APS’s 2022 LFCR adjustment, concluding that APS calculated the adjustment in accordance with its Plan of Administration.\nOn May 18, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 LFCR adjustment, with a rate effective date of June 1, 2022.\nOn February 15, 2023, APS filed a letter to the ACC docket stating that, in accordance with Decision No. 78585, APS and ACC Staff have agreed to move the filing date for the annual LFCR adjustment to July 31 each year.  On September 5, 2023, APS filed an updated LFCR Plan of Administration, which was approved by ACC Staff on December 8, 2023.  On July 31, 2023, APS filed its 2023 annual LFCR adjustment, requesting that the annual LFCR recovery amount be increased to $\n68.7\nmillion (a $\n9.6\nmillion increase from previous levels).  On October 19, 2023, a request for intervention was filed, which was granted.  Consistent with an October 25, 2023, Procedural Order, the parties met and conferred and conducted limited discovery.  Upon conclusion of discovery, ACC Staff will provide a Memorandum and Proposed Order that the parties will have an opportunity to respond to.  The ACC has not yet ruled on this application.\nTax Expense Adjustor Mechanism\n.  As part of the 2017 Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to a rate adjustment mechanism to address potential federal income tax reform and enable the pass-through of certain income tax effects to customers.\nThe TEAM expressly applies to APS’s retail rates with the exception of a small subset of customers taking service under specially-approved tariffs.\nAs part of the 2019 Rate Case decision, the TEAM rates were reset to zero beginning December 31, 2021.\nThe TEAM was retained in the 2022 Rate Case to address potential changes in tax law that may be enacted prior to a decision in a subsequent APS rate case.\nCourt Resolution Surcharge.\nThe CRS mechanism permits APS to recover certain costs associated with investments and expenses for APS’s purchase and installation of SCR technology for Four Corners Units 4 and 5 and a change in APS’s allowable return on equity as required by the Arizona Court of Appeals and approved by the ACC in Decision No. 78979.\nThe CRS went into effect on July 1, 2023, at\n132\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\na rate of $\n0.00175\nper kWh.\nThe rate is designed to recover $\n59.6\nmillion in revenue lost by APS between December of 2021 and June 20, 2023, and the prospective recovery of ongoing costs related to the SCR investments and expense and the allowable return on equity difference in current base rates.\nThe current CRS will be recalculated on the effective date of the 2022 Rate Case to remove the effects of the prospective recovery related to the allowable return on equity difference.\nThe portion of the CRS representing the recovery of the $\n59.6\nmillion of lost revenue between December of 2021 and June 20, 2023, $\n9.4\nmillion of which has been collected as of December 31, 2023, will cease upon full collection of the lost revenue.\nFinally, recovery of ongoing costs related to the SCR investments will continue until the Company’s next rate case in which they can be incorporated therein.  On February 22, 2024, the ACC approved the 2022 Rate Case ROO, as amended.  The CRS tariff is currently being recalculated to reflect the final decision in that case.  See “2019 Retail Rate Case” above for more information.\nNet Metering\nThe ACC’s decision from APS’s 2017 rate case (the “2017 Rate Case Decision”) provides that payments by utilities for energy exported to the grid from residential distributed generation (“DG”) solar facilities will be determined using a Resource Comparison Proxy (“RCP”) methodology as determined in the ACC’s generic Value and Cost of Distributed Generation docket.\nRCP is a method that is based on the most recent five-year rolling average price that APS incurs for utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects.  The price established by this RCP method will be updated annually (between general retail rate cases) but will not be decreased by more than\n10\n% per year.\nThe ACC is no longer pursuing development of a forecasted avoided cost methodology as an option for utilities in place of the RCP.\nCommercial customers, grandfathered residential solar customers, and residential customers with DG systems other than solar facilities continue to qualify for net metering.\nIn addition, the ACC made the following determinations in the Value and Cost of Distributed Generation docket:\n•\nRCP customers who have interconnected a DG system or submitted an application for interconnection for DG systems will be grandfathered for a period of\n20\nyears from the date the customer’s interconnection application was accepted by the utility (for APS residential customers, as of September 1, 2017, based on APS’s 2017 Rate Case Decision);\n•\ncustomers with DG solar systems are to be considered a separate class of customers for ratemaking purposes; and\n•\nonce an initial export price is set for utilities, no netting or banking of retail credits will be available for new DG customers, and the then-applicable export price will be guaranteed for new customers for a period of\n10\nyears.\nThis decision of the ACC addresses policy determinations only.\nThe decision states that its principles will be applied in future general retail rate cases, and the policy determinations themselves may be subject to future change, as are all ACC policies.\nOn April 29, 2022, APS filed an application to decrease the RCP price from\n9.4\ncents per kWh, which had been in effect since October 1, 2021, to\n8.46\ncents per kWh, reflecting a\n10\n% annual reduction, to become effective September 1, 2022.\nOn July 12, 2022, the ACC approved the RCP as filed.\n133\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn May 1, 2023, APS filed an application for revisions to the RCP.\nThis application would decrease the RCP price to\n7.619\ncents per kWh, reflecting a\n10\n% annual reduction, to become effective September 1, 2023.\nOn August 25, 2023, the ACC approved the RCP as filed.\nOn October 11, 2023, the ACC voted to open a new general docket to hold a hearing to explore potential future changes to the\n10\n% annual reduction cap in the solar export rate paid by utilities to distributed solar customers for exports to the grid and the 10-year rate lock period for those customers that were approved in the ACC’s Value and Cost of Distributed Generation Docket.  A procedural conference was held on November 1, 2023, to discuss the process going forward.  As a result of the procedural conference, ACC Staff will conduct discovery to investigate the issues related to this matter.  A status conference will be held on March 20, 2024, to determine if ACC Staff is prepared to present a recommendation on this matter at that time.  The amounts the Company pays customers for solar exports under its RCP rate rider could be affected by this docket.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nEnergy Modernization Plan\nOn May 26, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to review articles within the Arizona Administrative Code related to Resource Planning, the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, and Electric Energy Efficiency Standards.  On January 9, 2024, the ACC approved a rulemaking process to begin on this matter.  During the ACC Open Meeting on February 6, 2024, the ACC approved motions to direct ACC Staff to include recommendations to repeal the current Electric Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Standard rules during the rulemaking process.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nIntegrated Resource Planning\nACC rules require utilities to develop triennial 15-year IRPs which describe how the utility plans to serve customer load in the plan timeframe.\nThe ACC reviews each utility’s IRP to determine if it meets the necessary requirements and whether it should be acknowledged.\nIn February 2022, the ACC acknowledged APS’s 2020 IRP filed on June 26, 2020.\nThe ACC also approved certain amendments to the IRP process, including, setting an EES of 1.3% of retail sales annually (averaged over a three-year period) and a demand-side resource capacity of 35% of 2020 peak demand by January 1, 2030.\nOn May 1, 2023, APS, Tucson Electric Power Company, and UNS Electric, Inc. filed a joint request for an extension to file the IRPs from August 1, 2023, to November 1, 2023.\nOn June 21, 2023, the ACC granted the extension.\nAs a result, APS filed its 2023 IRP on November 1, 2023.\nOn January 31, 2024, stakeholders filed comments regarding the IRP and APS has until May 31, 2024, to respond to the stakeholders’ comments.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nSee “Energy Modernization Plan” above for information regarding proposed changes to the IRP filings.\nEquity Infusions\nOn October 27, 2023, APS filed a notice of intent to increase Pinnacle West’s equity in APS in 2024.\nAPS is currently authorized to receive up to $\n150\nmillion annually in equity infusions from Pinnacle West without seeking ACC approval.  APS sought approval under Arizona Administrative Code provision R14-2-803 to receive from Pinnacle West in 2024 up to $\n500\nmillion in additional equity infusions above the currently authorized limit of  $\n150\nmillion  annually.\nOn January 9, 2024, the ACC approved the increased equity infusion limit for 2024.\n134\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPublic Utility Regulatory Policies Act\nUnder the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”), qualifying facilities are provided the right to sell energy and/or capacity to utilities and are granted relief from certain regulatory burdens.\nOn December 17, 2019, the ACC mandated a minimum contract length of 18 years for qualifying facilities over 100 kW in Arizona and established that the rate paid to qualifying facilities must be based on the long-term avoided cost.\n“Avoided cost” is generally defined as the price at which the utility could purchase or produce the same amount of power from sources other than the qualifying facility on a long-term basis.\nDuring calendar year 2020, APS entered into\ntwo\n18\n-year PPAs with qualified facilities, each for\n80\nMW solar facilities.\nIn March 2021, the ACC approved these agreements.\nOn July 19, 2023, the agreements for these two PPAs were terminated due to project delays.\nResidential Electric Utility Customer Service Disconnections\nOn June 13, 2019, APS voluntarily suspended electric disconnections for residential customers who had not paid their bills.\nOn June 20, 2019, the ACC voted to enact emergency rule amendments to prevent residential electric utility customer service disconnections during the period June 1 through October 15 (“Summer Disconnection Moratorium”).\nDuring the Summer Disconnection Moratorium, APS could not charge late fees and interest on amounts that were past due from customers.\nCustomer deposits must also be used to pay delinquent amounts before disconnection can occur.\nIn accordance with the emergency rules, APS began putting delinquent customers on a mandatory four-month payment plan beginning on October 16, 2019.\nIn June 2019, the ACC began a formal regular rulemaking process to allow stakeholder input and time for consideration of permanent rule changes.\nThe ACC further ordered that each regulated utility serving retail customers in Arizona update its service conditions by incorporating the emergency rule amendments, restore power to any customers who were disconnected during the month of June 2019 and credit any fees that were charged for a reconnection.\nThe ACC Staff and ACC proposed draft amendments to the customer service disconnections rules.\nOn April 14, 2021, the ACC voted to send to the formal rulemaking process a draft rules package governing customer disconnections that allows utilities to choose between a temperature threshold (above 95 degrees and below 32 degrees) or calendar method (June 1 – October 15) for disconnection moratoriums.\nOn November 2, 2021, the ACC approved the final rules, and on November 23, 2021, the rules were submitted to the Arizona Office of the Attorney General for final review and approval.\nThe new rules became effective on April 18, 2022.\nIn accordance with the ACC service disconnection rules, APS now uses the calendar-based method to suspend the disconnection of customers for nonpayment from June 1 through October 15 each year (“Annual Disconnection Moratorium”).\nCustomers with past due balances of $\n75\nor greater as of the end of the Annual Disconnection Moratorium are automatically placed on six-month payment arrangements.\nIn addition, APS voluntarily began waiving late payment fees of its customers (“Late Fee Waivers”) on March 13, 2020.\nEffective February 1, 2023, late payment fees for residential customers were reinstated.\nLate payment fees for commercial and industrial customers were reinstated effective May 1, 2022.\nSince the suspensions and moratoriums on disconnections began, APS has experienced an increase in bad debt expense and the related write-offs of delinquent customer accounts.\n135\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRetail Electric Competition Rules\nOn November 17, 2018, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona.\nOn July 1 and July 2, 2019, ACC Staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules.\nOn February 10, 2020, two ACC Commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules.\nOn February 12, 2020, ACC Staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules.\nDuring a July 15, 2020, ACC Staff meeting, the ACC Commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program, but no action was taken.\nThe ACC continues to discuss matters related to retail electric competition, including the potential for additional buy-through programs or other pilot programs.\nIn April 2022, the Arizona Legislature passed, and the Governor signed, a bill that repealed the electric deregulation law that had been in place in Arizona since 1998.\nAPS cannot predict what impact, if any, this change will have on APS.\nOn August 4, 2021, Green Mountain Energy filed an application seeking a certificate of convenience and necessity to allow it to provide competitive electric generation service in Arizona.\nGreen Mountain Energy has requested that the ACC grant it the ability to provide competitive service in APS’s and Tucson Electric Power Company’s certificated service territories and proposes to deliver a 100% renewable energy product to residential and general service customers in those service territories.\nAPS opposes Green Mountain Energy’s application.\nOn November 3, 2021, the ACC submitted questions to the Arizona Attorney General requesting legal opinions related to a number of issues surrounding retail electric competition and the ACC’s ability to issue competitive certificates of convenience and necessity.\nOn November 26, 2021, the Administrative Law Judge issued a procedural order indicating it would not be appropriate to set a schedule until the Attorney General has provided insights on the applicable law.\nAs the ACC’s questions pertained to the retail competition law subsequently repealed in April 2022, the Attorney General has not responded to the ACC’s request and the questions are now moot.\nNo action has been taken by the ACC regarding this application since that time.\nHowever, on May 17, 2023, the Retail Energy Supply Association filed a motion with the ACC requesting it to re-open the generic docket to re-examine the ACC’s electric competition rules.\nNo action has been taken by the ACC regarding this motion.\nAPS cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nOn October 28, 2021, an ACC Commissioner docketed a letter directing ACC Staff and interested stakeholders to design a 200 to 300 MW pilot program that would allow residential and small commercial customers of APS to elect a competitive electricity supplier.\nThe letter also states that similar programs should be designed for other Arizona regulated electric utilities.\nAPS cannot predict the outcome of these future activities\n.\nFour Corners SCR Cost Recovery\nOn December 29, 2017, in accordance with the 2017 Rate Case Decision, APS filed a Notice of Intent to file its SCR Adjustment to permit recovery of costs associated with the installation of SCR equipment at Four Corners Units 4 and 5.  APS filed the SCR Adjustment request in April 2018.  The SCR Adjustment request provided that there would be a $\n67.5\nmillion annual revenue impact that would be applied as a percentage of base rates for all applicable customers.  Also, as provided for in the 2017 Rate Case Decision, APS requested that the adjustment become effective no later than January 1, 2019.  The hearing for this matter occurred in September 2018.  At the hearing, APS accepted ACC Staff’s\n136\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrecommendation of a lower annual revenue impact of approximately $\n58.5\nmillion.\nThe Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Opinion and Order finding that the costs for the SCR project were prudently incurred and recommending authorization of the $\n58.5\nmillion annual revenue requirement related to the installation and operation of the SCRs.\nThe ACC did not issue a decision on this matter.  APS included the costs for the SCR project in the retail rate base in its 2019 Rate Case filing with the ACC.\nOn November 2, 2021, the 2019 Rate Case decision was approved by the ACC allowing approximately $\n194\nmillion of SCR related plant investments and cost deferrals in rate base and to recover, depreciate and amortize in rates based on an end-of-life assumption of July 2031.\nThe decision also included a partial and combined disallowance of $\n215.5\nmillion on the SCR investments and deferrals.\nAPS believes the SCR plant investments and related SCR cost deferrals were prudently incurred, and on December 17, 2021, APS filed its Notice of Direct Appeal at the Arizona Court of Appeals requesting review of the $\n215.5\nmillion disallowance.  The Arizona Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on November 30, 2022.\nOn March 6, 2023, the Court of Appeals issued its order in the matter, vacating the ACC’s disallowance of the SCR investment and remanding the matter back to the ACC for further review in accordance with ACC rules and the order of the Court of Appeals.\nOn June 21, 2023, the ACC approved a joint settlement filed by APS and the ACC’s Legal Division that resolved all issues relating to the 2019 Rate Case decision, including recovery of the cost of the Four Corners SCRs.\nSee above for further discussion on the 2019 Rate Case decision.\nCholla\nOn September 11, 2014, APS announced that it would close Unit 2 of the Cholla Power Plant (“Cholla”) and cease burning coal at the other APS-owned units (Units 1 and 3) at the plant by the mid-2020s, if the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) approved a compromise proposal offered by APS to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules.\nOn April 14, 2015, the ACC approved APS’s plan to retire Unit 2, without expressing any view on the future recoverability of APS’s remaining investment in the unit.\nAPS closed Unit 2 on October 1, 2015.\nIn early 2017, EPA approved a final rule incorporating APS’s compromise proposal, which took effect on April 26, 2017.\nIn December 2019, PacifiCorp notified APS that it planned to retire Cholla Unit 4 by the end of 2020 and the unit ceased operation in December 2020.\nAPS is required to cease burning coal at its remaining Cholla units by April 2025.\nPreviously, APS estimated Cholla Unit 2’s end of life to be 2033.\nAPS has been recovering a return on and of the net book value of the unit in base rates.\nPursuant to the 2017 Settlement Agreement described above, APS will be allowed continued recovery of the net book value of the unit and the unit’s decommissioning and other retirement-related costs, $\n32.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, in addition to a return on its investment.\nIn accordance with GAAP, in the third quarter of 2014, Unit 2’s remaining net book value was reclassified from property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset.\nIn accordance with the 2019 Rate Case decision, the regulatory asset is being amortized through 2033.\n137\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNavajo Plant\nThe Navajo Plant ceased operations in November 2019.\nThe co-owners and the Navajo Nation executed a lease extension on November 29, 2017, that allows for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceased operations.\nIn accordance with GAAP, in the second quarter of 2017, APS’s remaining net book value of its interest in the Navajo Plant was reclassified from property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset.\nAPS has been recovering a return on and of the net book value of its interest in the Navajo plant in base rates over its previously estimated life through 2026.\nPursuant to the 2019 Rate Case decision described above, APS will be allowed continued recovery of the book value of its remaining investment in the Navajo plant, $\n43.0\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, in addition to a return on the net book value, with the exception of\n15\n% of the annual amortization expense in rates.\nIn addition, APS will be allowed recovery of other costs related to retirement and closure, including the Navajo coal reclamation regulatory asset, $\n10.9\nmillion as of December 31, 2023.  The disallowed recovery of\n15\n% of the annual amortization does not have a material impact on APS financial statements.\n138\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe detail of regulatory assets is as follows (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nThis asset represents the future recovery of pension benefit obligations and expense through retail rates.  If these costs are disallowed by the ACC, this regulatory asset would be charged to OCI and result in lower future revenues.  As a result of the 2019 Rate Case Decision, the amount authorized for inclusion in rate base was determined using an averaging methodology, which resulted in a reduced return in retail rates.  The approved 2022 Rate Case ROO, as amended, allows for the full return on the pension asset in rate base.  See Note 7 for further discussion.\n(b)\nSee “Cost Recovery Mechanisms” discussion above.\n(c)\nSubject to a carrying charge.\n(d)\nThere are no regulatory assets for which the ACC has allowed recovery of costs, but not allowed a return by exclusion from rate base.  FERC rates are set using a formula rate as described in “Transmission Rates, Transmission Cost Adjustor and Other Transmission Matters.”\n139\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(e)\nSee “Four Corners SCR Cost Recovery” discussion above.\n(f)\nCollected in retail rates.\n(g)\nAmortization periods vary based on specific terms of lease contract.  See Note 8.\nThe detail of regulatory liabilities is as follows (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nFor purposes of presentation on the Statement of Cash Flows, amortization of the regulatory liabilities for excess deferred income taxes are reflected as “Deferred income taxes” under Cash Flows From Operating Activities.\n(b)\nSee “Cost Recovery Mechanisms” discussion above.\n(c)\nIn accordance with regulatory accounting, APS accrues removal costs for its regulated assets, even if there is no legal obligation for removal.\n(d)\nSee Note 7.\n4.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax purposes than they are for financial statement purposes.  The tax effect of these differences is recorded as deferred taxes.  We calculate deferred taxes using currently enacted income tax rates.\nAPS has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to income taxes on its Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated operations.  The\n140\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nregulatory assets are for certain temporary differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during construction, investment tax credit (“ITC”) basis adjustment and tax expense of Medicare subsidy.  The regulatory liabilities primarily relate to the change in income tax rates and deferred taxes resulting from ITCs.\nAPS ITCs are deferred and are amortized over the life of the related property with such amortization applied as a credit to reduce current income tax expense in the Statements of Income.\nNet income associated with the Palo Verde sale leaseback VIEs is not subject to tax.  As a result, there is\nno\nincome tax expense associated with the VIEs recorded on the Pinnacle West Consolidated and APS Consolidated Statements of Income.  See Note 17 for additional details related to the Palo Verde sale leaseback VIEs.\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at the beginning and end of the year that are included in accrued taxes and unrecognized tax benefits (dollars in thousands):\nIncluded in the balances of unrecognized tax benefits are the following tax positions that, if recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate (dollars in thousands):\nAs of the balance sheet date, the tax year ended December 31, 2020, and all subsequent tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS.  With a few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019.\n141\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe reflect interest and penalties, if any, on unrecognized tax benefits in the Pinnacle West Consolidated and APS Consolidated Statements of Income as income tax expense.\nThe amount of interest expense or benefit recognized related to unrecognized tax benefits are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nFollowing are the total amount of accrued liabilities for interest recognized related to unrecognized benefits that could reverse and decrease our effective tax rate to the extent matters are settled favorably (dollars in thousands):\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2023, we have recognized less than $\n1\nmillion of interest expense to be paid on the underpayment of income taxes for certain adjustments that we have filed, or will file, with the IRS.\nThe components of income tax expense are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n142\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following chart compares pretax income at the 21% statutory federal income tax rate to income tax expense (dollars in thousands):\n143\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe components of the net deferred income tax liability were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2023, Pinnacle West consolidated deferred tax assets for credit and loss carryforwards relate to federal and state credit carryforwards, net of federal benefit, of $\n56\nmillion, which first begin to expire in 2025.  Pinnacle West consolidated credit and loss carryforwards amount above has been reduced by $\n12\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits.\nAs of December 31, 2023, APS consolidated deferred tax assets for credit and loss carryforwards relate to federal and state credit carryforwards, net of federal benefit, of $\n15\nmillion, which first begin to expire in 2028.  APS consolidated credit and loss carryforwards amount above has been reduced by $\n12\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits.\n144\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n5.\nLines of Credit and Short-Term Borrowings\nPinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide credit support for their commercial paper programs, to refinance indebtedness, and for other general corporate purposes.\nThe table below presents the consolidated credit facilities and the amounts available and outstanding (dollars in thousands):\nPinnacle West\nOn April 10, 2023, Pinnacle West replaced its $\n200\nmillion revolving credit facility that would have matured on May 28, 2026, with a new $\n200\nmillion revolving credit facility that matures on April 10, 2028.  Pinnacle West has the option to increase the amount of the facility up to a total of $\n300\nmillion upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders.  Interest rates are based on Pinnacle West’s senior unsecured debt credit ratings and the agreement includes a sustainability-linked pricing metric which permits an interest rate reduction or increase by meeting or missing targets related to specific environmental and employee health and safety sustainability objectives.  The facility is available to support Pinnacle West’s general corporate purposes, including support for Pinnacle West’s $\n200\nmillion commercial paper program, for bank borrowings or for issuances of letters of credit.  At December 31, 2023, Pinnacle\nWest had\nno\noutstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility,\nno\nletters of credit outstanding under t\nhe credit facility, and\n$\n77\nmillion\nof outstanding commercial paper borrowings.  The weighted-average interest rate for the outstanding borrowings on December 31, 2023, was\n5.47\n%.\nAPS\nOn April 10, 2023, APS replaced its\ntwo\n$\n500\nmillion revolving credit facilities that would have matured on May 28, 2026, with a new $\n1.25\nbillion revolving credit facility that matures on April 10, 2028.  APS has the option to increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum of $\n400\nmillion, for a total of $\n1.65\nbillion, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders.  Interest rates are based on APS’s senior unsecured debt credit ratings and the agreement includes a sustainability-linked pricing metric which permits an interest rate reduction or increase by meeting or missing targets related to specific environmental and employee health and safety sustainability objectives.  The facility is available to support APS’s general corporate purposes, including support for APS’s commercial paper program, which was incr\neased from $\n750\nmillion to $\n1\nbillion on April 10, 2023, for bank borrowings or for issuances of letters of credit.  At December 31, 2023, APS had\nno\noutstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility,\nno\nletters of credit outstanding under the credit facility, and\n145\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n$\n533\nmillion of outstanding commercial paper borrowings.  The weighted-average interest rate for the outstanding borrowings on December 31, 2023, was\n5.46\n%.\nOn December 12, 2023, APS entered into an agreement with a new\n364\n-day $\n350\nmillion term loan facility that matures on December 10, 2024.  Borrowings under the facility bear interest at SOFR plus\n1.0\n% per annum.  On February 9, 2024, APS drew the full amount of $\n350\nmillion.\nSee “Financial Assurances” in Note 10 for a discussion of other outst\nanding letters of credit.\nDebt Provisions\nOn December 15, 2022, the ACC issued a financing order that, among other things, reaffirmed APS’s short-term debt authorization\nequal to the sum of (i)\n7\n% of APS’s capitaliza\ntion, and (ii) $\n500\nmillion (which is required to be used for costs relating to purchases of natural gas and power).  See Note 6 for additional long-term debt provisions.\n146\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n6.\nLong-Term Debt and Liquidity Matters\nAll of Pinnacle West’s and APS’s debt is unsecured.\nThe following table presents the components of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets outstanding (dollars in thousands):\n(a)    This schedule does not reflect the timing of redemptions that may occur prior to maturities.\n(b)    The weighted-average interest rate for the variable rate pollution control bonds was\n4.11\n% at December 31, 2023, and\n3.96\n% at December 31, 2022.\n(c)    The weighted-average interest rate was\n6.20\n%\nat December 31, 2023, and\n5.10\n% at December 31, 2022.  See additional details below.\n(d)    On August 4, 2023, concurrent with the BCE Sale, the construction facility was transferred to Ameresco and the equity bridge loan was paid in full by Pinnacle West.  See Note 20 and discussion below.\n147\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows principal payments due on Pinnacle West’s and APS’s total long-term debt (dollars in thousands):\nDebt Fair Value\nOur long-term debt fair value estimates are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table represents the estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including current maturities (dollars in thousands):\nCredit Facilities and Debt Issuances\nPinnacle West\nOn December 16, 2022, Pinnacle West entered into a $\n175\nmillion term loan facility that matures December 16, 2024.  The proceeds were received on January 6, 2023, and used for general corporate purposes.  We recognized the term loan facility as long-term debt upon settlement on January 6, 2023.\nAPS\nAPS is currently authorized to receive up to $\n150\nmillion annually in equity infusions from Pinnacle West without seeking ACC approval.  On October 27, 2023, APS sought approval from the ACC to receive from Pinnacle West in 2024 up to an additional $\n500\nmillion in equity infusions above the authorized limit of $\n150\nmillion, and on January 9, 2024, the ACC approved the increased equity infusion limit for 2024.\nOn January 6, 2023, Pinnacle West contributed $\n150\nmillion into APS in the form of an equity infusion.  APS used this contribution to repay short-term indebtedness.\nOn June 30, 2023, APS issued $\n500\nmillion of\n5.55\n% unsecured senior notes that mature August 1, 2033.  The net proceeds from the sale were used to repay short-term indebtedness consisting of commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.\n148\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSee “Lines of Credit and Short-Term Borrowings” in Note 5 and “Financial Assurances” in Note 10 for discussion of APS’s separate outstanding letters of credit.\nBCE\nOn February 11, 2022, a special purpose subsidiary of BCE entered into a credit agreement to finance capital expenditures and related costs for the development of a\n31\nmegawatt (“MW”) solar and\n20\nmegawatt hour (“MWh”) battery storage project in Los Alamitos, California (“Los Alamitos”).  The credit agreement consisted of an equity bridge loan facility, a non-recourse construction facility, a letter of credit facility, and a related interest rate swap.  On August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Ameresco, Inc. (“Ameresco”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell all our equity interest in BCE to Ameresco (the “BCE Sale”).  See Note 20.  As a part of the BCE Sale closing, the $\n36\nmillion construction facility, the letter of credit facility, and the interest rate swap were transferred to Ameresco.  On August 4, 2023, concurrent with the BCE Sale, Pinnacle West paid in full the outstanding  $\n31\nmillion equity bridge loan balance.  As of December 31, 2023, there is no outstanding balance on our Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to this credit agreement.\nOn April 18, 2023, and on December 29, 2023, Pinnacle West issued performance guarantees in connection with BCE’s Kūpono Solar investment project financing.  BCE held an equity method investment relating to the Kūpono Solar project that was included in the BCE Sale relating to the stage of the BCE Sale that closed on January 12, 2024.  The performance guarantees did not transfer in the BCE Sale, and Pinnacle West continues to retain these performance guarantees.  See Note 10.\nDebt Provisions\nPinnacle West’s and APS’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios.  Pinnacle West and APS comply with this covenant.  For both Pinnacle West and APS, this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed\n65\n%.  At December 31, 2023, the ratio was approximately\n60\n% for Pinnacle West and\n52\n% for APS.  Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default, which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross-default other debt.  See further discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.\nNeither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade.  However, our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings.\nAll of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  All of APS’s bank agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings.\n149\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAlthough provisions in APS’s articles of incorporation and ACC financing orders establish maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that APS may issue, APS does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements.  On December 15, 2022, the ACC issued a financing order approving APS’s application filed on April 6, 2022, requesting to increase the long-term debt limit from $\n7.5\nbillion to $\n8.0\nbillion and to exclude financing lease PPAs from the definition of long-term indebtedness for purposes of the ACC financing orders.  See Note 5 for additional short-term debt provisions.\n150\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n7.\nRetirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\nPinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan (The Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Retirement Plan) and a non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries.  All new employees participate in the account balance plan.  Defined benefit plans specify the amount of benefits a plan participant is to receive using information about the participant.  The pension plan covers nearly all employees.  The supplemental excess benefit retirement plan covers officers of the Company and highly compensated employees designated for participation by the Board of Directors.  Our employees do not contribute directly to the plans.  We calculate the benefits based on age, years of service and pay.\nPinnacle West also sponsors other postretirement benefit plans (Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Group Life and Medical Plan and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Post-65 Retiree Health Reimbursement Arrangement “HRA”) for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries.  These plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees.  Employees must retire to become eligible for these retirement benefits, which are based on years of service and age.  For the medical insurance plan, retirees make contributions to cover a portion of the plan costs.  For the life insurance plan, retirees do not make contributions.  We retain the right to change or eliminate these benefits.\nPinnacle West uses a December 31 measurement date each year for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  The market-related value of our plan assets is their fair value at the measurement date.  See Note 12 for further discussion of how fair values are determined.  Due to subjective and complex judgments, which may be required in determining fair values, actual results could differ from the results estimated through the application of these methods.\nA significant portion of the changes in the actuarial gains and losses of our pension and postretirement plans is attributable to APS and are recoverable in rates.  Accordingly, these changes are recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.  Our retail rates provide for the inclusion of annual benefit expense, which allows for recovery or return of this regulatory asset/liability.\nS\nee Note 3.\n151\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides details of the plans’ net periodic benefit costs and the portion of these costs charged to expense (including administrative costs and excluding amounts capitalized as overhead construction or billed to electric plant participants) (dollars in thousands):\n(a)    Prior-service costs or credits reflect the impact of modifications to the pension or postretirement plan benefits.  The impact of these modifications is amortized over a period which reflects the demographics of the impacted population.  In 2014, Pinnacle West made changes to the postretirement benefits offered to Medicare eligible retirees which resulted in prior-service credits.  We have been amortizing these prior-serviced credits since 2015 with the last full-year amortization occurring in 2024.\nThe following table shows the plans’ changes in the benefit obligations and funded status (dollars in thousands):\n152\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows information for pension plans with an accumulated obligation in excess of plan assets (dollars in thousands):\nThe Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Retirement Plan is more than\n100\n% funded on an accumulated benefit obligation basis at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, therefore, the only pension plan with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets in 2023 and 2022 is a non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan.\nThe following table shows information for pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets (dollars in thousands):\nThe Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Retirement Plan is more than\n100\n% funded on a projected benefit obligation basis at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, therefore the only pension plan with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets in 2023 and 2022 is a non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan.\nThe following table shows the amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table shows the details related to accumulated other comprehensive loss (gain) as of December 31, 2023, and 2022 (dollars in thousands):\n153\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used for both the pension and other benefits to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs:\nIn selecting the pretax expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan.  For 2024, we are assuming a\n6.90\n% long-term rate of return for pension assets and\n7.00\n% (before tax) for other benefit assets, which we believe is reasonable given our asset allocation in relation to historical and expected performance.\nIn selecting our healthcare trend rates, we consider past performance and forecasts of healthcare costs.\nPlan Assets\nThe Board of Directors has delegated oversight of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets to an Investment Management Committee (“Committee”).  The Committee has adopted investment policy statements (“IPS”) for the pension and the other postretirement benefit plans’ assets.  The investment strategies for these plans include external management of plan assets.\nThe overall strategy of the pension plan’s IPS is to achieve an adequate level of trust assets relative to the benefit obligations.  To achieve this objective, the plan’s investment policy provides for mixes of investments including long-term fixed income assets and return-seeking assets.  The target allocation between return-seeking and long-term fixed income assets is defined in the IPS.  The plan’s funded status is reviewed on at least a monthly basis.\nChanges in the value of long-term fixed income assets, also known as liability-hedging assets, are intended to offset changes in the benefit obligations due to changes in interest rates.  Long-term fixed income assets consist primarily of fixed income debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, U.S. Treasury futures contracts, and fixed income debt securities issued by corporations.  Long-term fixed income assets may also include interest rate swaps, and other instruments.\n154\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReturn-seeking assets are intended to provide a reasonable long-term rate of investment return with a prudent level of volatility.  Return-seeking assets are composed of U.S. equities, international equities, and alternative investments.  International equities include investments in both developed and emerging markets.  Alternative investments may include investments in real estate, private debt and various other strategies.  The plan may also hold investments in return-seeking assets by holding securities in partnerships, common and collective trusts, and mutual funds.\nBased on the IPS, the target and actual allocation for the pension plan at December 31, 2023, are as follows:\nThe permissible range is within +/-5% of the target allocation shown in the above table, and also considers the plan’s funded status.\nThe following table presents the additional target allocations, as a percent of total pension plan assets, for the return-seeking assets:\nThe pension plan IPS does not provide for a specific mix of long-term fixed income assets but does expect the average credit quality of such assets to be investment grade.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the asset allocation for other postretirement benefit plan assets is governed by the IPS for those plans, which provides for different asset allocation target mixes depending on the characteristics of the liability.\nThe following table presents the actual allocations of the investment for the other postretirement benefit plan at December 31, 2023:\nSee Note 12 for a discussion on the fair value hierarchy and how fair value methodologies are applied.  The plans invest directly in fixed income, U.S. Treasury Futures Contracts, and equity securities, in addition to investing indirectly in fixed income securities, equity securities and real estate through the use of mutual funds, partnerships and common and collective trusts.  Equity securities held directly by the plans are valued using quoted active market prices from the published exchange on which the equity security trades and are classified as Level 1.  U.S. Treasury Futures Contracts are valued using the quoted active market prices from the exchange on which they trade and are classified as Level 1.  Fixed income\n155\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nsecurities issued by the U.S. Treasury held directly by the plans are valued using quoted active market prices and are classified as Level 1.  Fixed income securities issued by corporations, municipalities, and other agencies are primarily valued using quoted inactive market prices, or quoted active market prices for similar securities, or by utilizing calculations which incorporate observable inputs such as yield, maturity, and credit quality.  These instruments are classified as Level 2.\nMutual funds, partnerships, and common and collective trusts are valued utilizing a net asset value (“NAV”) concept or its equivalent.  Mutual funds, which includes exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), are classified as Level 1, and valued using a NAV that is observable and based on the active market in which the fund trades.\nCommon and collective trusts are maintained by banks or investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of objectives (such as tracking the performance of the S&P 500 Index).  The trust’s shares are offered to a limited group of investors and are not traded in an active market.  Investments in common and collective trusts are valued using NAV as a practical expedient and, accordingly, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.  The NAV for trusts investing in exchange traded equities, and fixed income securities is derived from the market prices of the underlying securities held by the trusts.  The NAV for trusts investing in real estate is derived from the appraised values of the trust’s underlying real estate assets.\nInvestments in partnerships are also valued using the concept of NAV as a practical expedient and, accordingly, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.  The NAV for these investments is derived from the value of the partnerships’ underlying assets.  The plan’s partnerships holdings relate to investments in high-yield fixed income instruments.  Certain partnerships also include funding commitments that may require the plan to contribute up to $\n50\nmillion to these partnerships; as of December 31, 2023, approximately $\n38\nmillion of these commitments have been funded.\nThe plans’ trustee provides valuation of our plan assets by using pricing services that utilize methodologies described to determine fair market value.  We have internal control procedures to ensure this information is consistent with fair value accounting guidance.  These procedures include assessing valuations using an independent pricing source, verifying that pricing can be supported by actual recent market transactions, assessing hierarchy classifications, comparing investment returns with benchmarks, and obtaining and reviewing independent audit reports on the trustee’s internal operating controls and valuation processes.\n156\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe fair value of Pinnacle West’s pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets at December 31, 2023, by asset category, are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nThese investments primarily represent assets valued using NAV as a practical expedient and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(b)\nThis category consists primarily of debt securities issued by municipalities and asset backed securities.\n(c)\nThis category primarily consists of U.S. common stock equities.\n(d)\nThese funds invest in international common stock equities.\n(e)\nThis category includes plan receivables and payables.\n157\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe fair value of Pinnacle West’s pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets at December 31, 2022, by asset category, are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nThese investments primarily represent assets valued using NAV as a practical expedient and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(b)\nThis category consists primarily of debt securities issued by municipalities.\n(c)\nThis category primarily consists of U.S. common stock equities.\n(d)\nThese funds invest in U.S. and international common stock equities.\n(e)\nThis category includes plan receivables and payables.\nContributions\nFuture year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions.  In 2023 and 2022, we did not make any contributions to our pension plan.  In 2021, we made contributions to our pension plan totaling $\n100\nmillion.  The minimum required contributions for the pension plan are\nzero\nfor the next three years and we do not expect to make any voluntary contributions in 2024, 2025, or 2026.  With regard to contributions to our other postretirement benefit plan, we did not make a contribution in 2023 or 2022 and do not expect to make any contributions in 2024, 2025 or 2026.\n158\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company was reimbursed $\n23\nmillion in 2023, $\n26\nmillion in 2022, and $\n24\nmillion in 2021 for prior years retiree medical claims from the other postretirement benefit plan trust assets.\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nBenefit payments, which reflect estimated future employee service, for the next five years and the succeeding five years thereafter, are estimated to be as follows (dollars in thousands):\nElectric plant participants contribute to the above amounts in accordance with their respective participation agreements.\nEmployee Savings Plan Benefits\nPinnacle West sponsors a defined contribution savings plan for eligible employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries.  In 2023, costs related to APS’s employees represented\n99\n% of the total cost of this plan.  In a defined contribution savings plan, the benefits a participant receives result from regular contributions participants make to their own individual account, the Company’s matching contributions and earnings or losses on their investments.  Under this plan, the Company matches a percentage of the participants’ contributions in cash which is then invested in the same investment mix as participants elect to invest their own future contributions.  Pinnacle West recorded expenses for this plan of approximately $\n12\nmillion for 2023, $\n12\nmillion for 2022, and $\n12\nmillion for 2021.\n8.\nLeases\nWe lease certain land, buildings, vehicles, equipment, and other property through operating rental agreements with varying terms, provisions, and expiration dates.  APS also has certain purchased power and energy storage agreements that qualify as lease arrangements.  Our leases have remaining terms that expire in 2024 through 2073.  Substantially all of our leasing activities relate to APS.\nIn 1986, APS entered into agreements with\nthree\nseparate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2 and related common facilities.  These lessor trust entities have been deemed VIEs for which APS is the primary beneficiary.  As the primary beneficiary, APS consolidated these lessor trust entities.  The impacts of these sale leaseback transactions are excluded from our lease disclosures as lease accounting is eliminated upon consolidation.  See Note 17 for a discussion of VIEs.\nAPS has purchased power lease agreements that allow APS the right to the generation capacity from certain natural-gas fueled generators during certain months of each year throughout the term of the arrangements.  As APS only has rights to use the assets during certain periods of each year, the leases have\n159\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nnon-consecutive periods of use.  APS does not operate or maintain the leased assets.  APS controls the dispatch of the leased assets during the months of use and is required to pay a fixed monthly capacity payment during these periods of use.  For these types of leased assets, APS has elected to combine both the lease and non-lease payment components and accounts for the entire fixed payment as a lease obligation.  In addition to the fixed monthly capacity payments, APS must also pay variable charges based on the actual production volume of the assets.  The variable consideration is not included in the measurement of our lease obligation.\nIn January 2023, APS modified\ntwo\nexisting purchase power operating lease agreements.  Among other changes, the modifications extend the expiration dates of these contracts from October 2027 to October 2032 for one of the leases, and from September 2026 to October 2034 for the other lease.  These lease agreements previously commenced in 2020 and 2021.\nAPS has executed various energy storage purchased power lease agreements that allow APS the right to charge and discharge energy storage facilities.  The first of these energy storage leases commenced in September 2023, and is classified as an operating lease.  This agreement provides APS the use of the energy storage facility through May 2043.  APS pays a fixed monthly capacity price for rights to use the leased asset.  APS does not operate or maintain the energy storage facility, and has no purchase options or residual value guarantees relating to the lease asset.  For this class of energy storage lease assets, APS has elected to separate the lease and non-lease components.\nThe following table provides information related to our lease costs (dollars in thousands):\n(a)     Primarily relates to purchased power lease contracts.\nLease costs are primarily included as a component of operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  Lease costs relating to purchased power and energy storage lease contracts are recorded in fuel and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Income and are subject to recovery under the PSA or RES.  See Note 3.  The tables above reflect the lease cost amounts before the effect of regulatory deferral under the PSA and RES.  Variable lease costs are recognized in the period the costs are incurred, and primarily relate to renewable purchased power lease contracts.  Payments under most renewable purchased power lease contracts are dependent upon environmental factors, and due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reliability of the fuel source, the payments are considered variable and are excluded from the measurement of lease\nliabilities and right-of-use lease assets.  Certain of our lease agreements have lease terms with non-consecutive periods of use.  For these agreements we recognize lease costs during the periods of use.  Leases with initial terms of 12 months or less are considered short-term leases and are not recorded on the balance sheet.\n160\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides information related to the maturity of our operating lease liabilities (dollars in thousands):\nWe recognize lease assets and liabilities upon lease commencement.  At December 31, 2023, we have various lease arrangements that have been executed, but have not yet commenced.  We expect the total fixed consideration paid for these arrangements, which includes both lease and non-lease payments, will approximate $\n7.1\nbillion over the terms of the agreements.  These arrangements primarily relate to energy storage assets.  The lease commencement dates for these arrangements have experienced delays.  APS continues to work with the lessors to determine revised commencement dates.  We expect lease commencement dates ranging from April 2024 through June 2025, with lease terms expiring through May 2045.  As a result of these delays and other events, APS has received cash proceeds from the lessors prior to lease commencement.  Proceeds received from lessors relating to energy storage PPA leases are accounted for as lease incentives on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and upon lease commencement are amortized over the associated lease term.  For regulatory purposes, the proceeds received by APS relating to these PPA leases are treated as a reduction to fuel and purchased power costs through the PSA in the period proceeds are received.  See Note 3.\n161\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables provide other additional information related to operating lease liabilities (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nPrimarily relates to the\ntwo\npurchased power operating lease agreements that were modified in January 2023.\n(b)\nMost of our lease agreements do not contain an implicit rate that is readily determinable.  For these agreements we use our incremental borrowing rate to measure the present value of lease liabilities.  We determine our incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement based on the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.  We use the implicit rate when it is readily determinable.\n162\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n9.\nJointly-Owned Facilities\nAPS shares ownership of some of its generating and transmission facilities with other companies.  We are responsible for our share of operating costs which are included in the corresponding operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  We are also responsible for providing our own financing.  Our share of operating expenses and utility plant costs related to these facilities is accounted for using proportional consolidation.\nThe following table shows APS’s interests in those jointly-owned facilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nSee Note 17.\n(b)\nWeighted-average of interests.\n(c)\nPacifiCorp owns Cholla Unit 4 (see Note 3 for additional information), and APS operated the unit for PacifiCorp.  Cholla Unit 4 was retired on December 24, 2020.  The common facilities at Cholla are jointly-owned.\n163\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n10.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nPalo Verde Generating Station\nSpent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal\nOn December 19, 2012, APS, acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of Palo Verde, filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the DOE in the United States Court of Federal Claims (“Court of Federal Claims”).\nThe lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to DOE’s breach of the Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High Level Radioactive Waste (“Standard Contract”) for failing to accept Palo Verde’s spent nuclear fuel and high level waste from January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2011, pursuant to the terms of the Standard Contract and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\nOn August 18, 2014, APS and DOE entered into a settlement agreement, which required DOE to pay the Palo Verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by Palo Verde during the period January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2011.\nIn addition, the settlement agreement provided APS with a method for submitting claims and getting recovery for costs incurred through December 31, 2016, which was extended to December 31, 2025.\nAPS has submitted\nnine\nclaims pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014 settlement agreement, for\nnine\nseparate time periods during July 1, 2011 through October 31, 2022.\nThe DOE has approved and paid\n$\n138.2\nmillion for these claims (APS’s share is $\n40.2\nmillion).\nThe amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income.\nIn accordance with the 2017 Rate Case Decision, this regulatory liability is being refunded to customers.\nSee Note 3.  On October 31, 2023, APS filed its\nten\nth claim pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014, settlement agreement in the amount of $\n18.46\nmillion (APS’s share is $\n5.4\nmillion).  In February 2024, the DOE approved $\n18.39\nmillion of this claim.\nNuclear Insurance\nPublic liability for incidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act (“Price-Anderson Act”), which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both commercial sources and an industry-wide retrospective payment plan.\nThis insurance limit is subject to an adjustment every five years based upon the aggregate percentage change in the Consumer Price Index.\nThe most recent adjustment took effect on January 1, 2024.\nAs of that date, in accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, the Palo Verde participants are insured against public liability for a nuclear incident up to approximately $\n16.3\nbillion per occurrence.\nPalo Verde maintains the maximum available nuclear liability insurance in the amount of $\n500\nmillion, which is provided by American Nuclear Insurers.  The remaining balance of approximately $\n15.8\nbillion\nof liability coverage is provided through a mandatory, industry-wide retrospective premium program.  If losses at any nuclear power plant covered by the program exceed the accumulated funds, APS could be responsible for retrospective premiums.  The maximum retrospective premium per reactor under the program for each nuclear liability incident is approximately\n$\n165.9\nmillion, subject to a maximum annual premium of approximately $\n24.7\nmillion per incident.  Based on APS’s ownership interest in the\nthree\nPalo Verde units, APS’s maximum retrospective premium per incident for all\nthree\nunits is approximately $\n144.9\nmillion, with a maximum annual retrospective premium of approximately $\n21.6\nmillion.\n164\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Palo Verde participants maintain insurance for property damage to, and decontamination of, property at Palo Verde in the aggregate amount of\n$\n2.8\nbillion.  APS has also secured accidental outage insurance for a sudden and unforeseen accidental outage of any of the\nthree\nunits.  The property damage, decontamination, and accidental outage insurance are provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (“NEIL”).  APS is subject to retrospective premium adjustments under all NEIL policies if NEIL’s losses in any policy year exceed accumul\nated funds.  Th\ne maximum amount APS could incur under the current NEIL policies totals approximately\n$\n22.4\nmillion\nfor each retrospective premium assessment declared by NEIL’s Board of Directors due to losses.  Additionally, at the sole discretion of the NEIL Board of Directors, APS would be liable to provide approximately $\n62.6\nmillion in deposit premium within\n20\ndays of request as assurance to satisfy any site obligation of retrospective premium assessment.  The insurance coverage discussed in this, and the previous paragraph, is subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits, and exclusions.\nFuel and Purchased Power Commitments and Purchase Obligations\nAPS is party to various fuel and purchased power contracts and purchase obligations with terms expiring between 2024 and 2045 that include required purchase provisions.  APS estimates the contract requirements to be approximately $\n1,034\nmillion in 2024; $\n1,190\nmillion in 2025; $\n1,310\nmillion in 2026; $\n1,284\nmillion in 2027; $\n1,292\nmillion in 2028; and $\n14.7\nbillion thereafter.  However, these amounts may vary significantly pursuant to certain provisions in such contracts that permit us to decrease required purchases under certain circumstances.  These amounts include estimated commitments relating to purchased power lease contracts.  See Note 8.\nOf the various fuel and purchased power contracts mentioned above, some of those contracts for coal supply include take-or-pay provisions.  The current coal contracts with take-or-pay provisions have terms expiring through 2031.\nThe following table summarizes our estimated coal take-or-pay commitments (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nTotal take-or-pay commitments are approximately $\n1.7\nbillion.  The total net present value of these commitments is approximately $\n1.4\nbillion.\nAPS may spend more to meet its actual fuel requirements than the minimum purchase obligations in our coal take-or-pay contracts.\nThe following table summarizes actual amounts purchased under the coal contracts which include take-or-pay provisions for each of the last three years (dollars in thousands):\n165\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRenewable Energy Credits\nAPS has entered into contracts to purchase renewable energy credits to comply with the RES.  APS estimates the contract requirements to be approximately $\n29\nmillion in 2024; $\n27\nmillion in 2025; $\n24\nmillion in 2026; $\n20\nmillion in 2027; $\n17\nmillion in 2028; and $\n52\nmillion thereafter.  These amounts do not include purchases of renewable energy credits that are bundled with energy.\nCoal Mine Reclamation Obligations\nAPS must reimburse certain coal providers for final and contemporaneous coal mine reclamation.  We account for contemporaneous reclamation costs as part of the cost of the delivered coal.  We utilize site-specific studies of costs expected to be incurred in the future to estimate our final reclamation obligation.  These studies utilize various assumptions to estimate the future costs.  Based on the most recent reclamation studies, APS recorded an obligation for the coal mine final reclamation of approximately $\n184\nmillion at December 31, 2023, and $\n179\nmillion at December 31, 2022.  Under our current coal supply agreements, APS expects to make payments for the final mine reclamation as follows: $\n19\nmillion in 2024; $\n20\nmillion in 2025; $\n21\nmillion in 2026; $\n22\nmillion in 2027; $\n23\nmillion in 2028; and $\n2\nmillion thereafter.  These funds are held in an escrow account and will be distributed to certain coal providers under the terms of the applicable coal supply agreements.  Any amendments to current coal supply agreements may change the timing of the contribution or cost of final reclamation.  The annual payments to the escrow account and final distribution to certain coal providers may be subject to adjustments based on escrow earnings.\nSuperfund and Other Related Matters\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“Superfund” or “CERCLA”) establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil, water or air.  Those who released, generated, transported to or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among the parties who are potentially responsible (each a “PRP”).  PRPs may be strictly, jointly, and severally liable for clean-up.  On September 3, 2003, EPA advised APS that EPA considers APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52nd Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (“OU3”) in Phoenix, Arizona.  APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site.  APS and Pinnacle West have agreed with EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within OU3.  In addition, on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study (“RI/FS”).  The RI/FS for OU3 was finalized and submitted to EPA at the end of 2022.\nAPS cannot predict the EPA’s timing with respect to this matter.\nAPS’s estimated costs related to this investigation and study is approximately\n$\n3\nmillion.\nAPS anticipates incurring additional expenditures in the future, but because the ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized by EPA, at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated.\nIn connection with APS’s status as a PRP for OU3, since 2013, APS and at least two dozen other parties have been defendants in various CERCLA lawsuits stemming from allegations that contamination from OU3 and elsewhere has impacted groundwater wells operated by the Roosevelt Irrigation District (“RID”).\nAt this time, only one active lawsuit remains pending, which is on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit based on a U.S. District Court order dismissing cost recovery claims of approximately\n$\n20.7\nmillion by a service provider for RID.\nAPS is unable to predict the outcome of any\n166\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfurther litigation related to this claim or APS’s share of liability related to that claim; however, APS does not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, as part of a state governmental investigation into groundwater contamination in this area, on January 25, 2015, the ADEQ sent a letter to APS seeking information concerning the degree to which, if any, APS’s current and former ownership of these facilities may have contributed to groundwater contamination in this area.\nAPS responded to ADEQ on May 4, 2015.\nSince that time, ADEQ has taken no action based on the information provided by APS.\nOn February 28, 2022, EPA provided APS with a request for information under CERCLA related to APS’s Ocotillo power plant site located in Tempe, Arizona.\nIn particular, EPA seeks information from APS regarding APS’s use, storage, and disposal of substances containing per-and polyfluoroalkyl (“PFAS”) compounds at the Ocotillo power plant site in order to aid EPA’s investigation into actual or threatened releases of PFAS into groundwater within the South Indian Bend Wash (“SIBW”) Superfund site.\nThe SIBW Superfund site includes the APS Ocotillo power plant site.\nAPS filed its response to this information request on April 29, 2022.\nOn January 17, 2023, EPA contacted APS to inform the Company that it would be commencing on-site investigations within the SIBW site, including the Ocotillo power plant, and performing a remedial investigation and feasibility study related to potential PFAS impacts to groundwater over the next two to three years.\nAPS estimates that its costs to oversee and participate in the remedial investigation work will be approximately $\n1.7\nmillion.\nAt the present time, we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter and any further expenditures related to necessary remediation, if any, or further investigations cannot be reasonably estimated.\nFour Corners SCR Cost Recovery\nAs part of APS’s 2019 Rate Case, APS included recovery of the deferral and rate base effects of the Four Corners SCR project.\nOn November 2, 2021, the 2019 Rate Case decision was approved by the ACC allowing approximately\n$\n194\nmillion\nof SCR related plant investments and cost deferrals in rate base and to recover, depreciate and amortize in rates based on an end-of-life assumption of July 2031.\nThe decision also included a partial and combined disallowance of\n$\n215.5\nmillion\non the SCR investments and deferrals.\nAPS believes the SCR plant investments and related SCR cost deferrals were prudently incurred, and on\nDecember 17, 2021, APS filed its Notice of Direct Appeal at the Arizona Court of Appeals requesting review of the\n$\n215.5\nmillion\ndisallowance.\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on November 30, 2022.\nOn March 6, 2023, the Court of Appeals issued its order in the matter, vacating the ACC’s disallowance of the SCR investment and remanding the matter back to the ACC for further review in accordance with ACC rules and the order of the Court of Appeals.\nOn June 21, 2023, the ACC approved a joint settlement filed by APS and the ACC’s Legal Division that resolved all issues relating to the 2019 Rate Case decision, including recovery of the cost of the Four Corners SCRs.\nSee Note 3\nfor additional information regarding the Four Corners SCR cost recovery and the 2019 Rate Case.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAPS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations, including air emissions of both conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste, hazardous waste, and coal combustion residuals (“CCRs”).  These laws and regulations can change from time to time, imposing new obligations on APS\n167\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nresulting in increased capital, operating, and other costs.  Associated capital expenditures or operating costs could be material.  APS intends to seek recovery of any such environmental compliance costs through our rates but cannot predict whether it will obtain such recovery.  The following proposed and final rules could involve material compliance costs to APS.\nCoal Combustion Waste\n.\nOn December 19, 2014, EPA issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of CCR, such as fly ash and bottom ash.\nThe rule regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions.\nThese criteria include standards governing location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and internet posting requirements.\nThe rule generally requires any existing unlined CCR surface impoundment to stop receiving CCR and either retrofit or close, and further requires the closure of any CCR landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity.\nSuch closure requirements are deemed “forced closure” or “closure for cause” of unlined surface impoundments and are the subject of the regulatory and judicial activities described below.\nSince these regulations were finalized, EPA has taken steps to substantially modify the federal rules governing CCR disposal.\nWhile certain changes have been prompted by utility industry petitions, others have resulted from judicial review, court-approved settlements with environmental groups, and statutory changes to RCRA.\nThe following lists the pending regulatory changes that, if finalized, could have a material impact as to how APS manages CCR at its coal-fired power plants:\n•\nFollowing the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act in 2016, EPA possesses authority to either authorize states to develop their own permit programs for CCR management or issue federal permits governing CCR disposal both in states without their own permit programs and on tribal lands.\nAlthough ADEQ has taken steps to develop a CCR permitting program, and new state legislation has been adopted providing ADEQ with appropriate permitting authority for CCR under the state solid waste management program, it is not clear when that program will be put into effect.\nOn December 19, 2019, EPA proposed its own set of regulations governing the issuance of CCR management permits, which would impact facilities like Four Corners located on the Navajo Nation.\nThe proposal remains pending.\n•\nOn March 1, 2018, as a result of a settlement with certain environmental groups, EPA proposed adding boron to the list of constituents that trigger corrective action requirements to remediate groundwater impacted by CCR disposal activities.\nApart from a subsequent proposal issued on August 14, 2019, to add a specific, health-based groundwater protection standard for boron, EPA has yet to take action on this proposal.\n•\nWith respect to APS’s Cholla facility, APS’s application for alternative closure was submitted to EPA on November 30, 2020.\nWhile EPA has deemed APS’s application administratively “complete,” the Agency’s approval remains pending.\nIf granted, this application would allow the continued disposal of CCR within Cholla’s existing unlined CCR surface impoundments until the required date for ceasing coal-fired boiler operations in April 2025.\nThis application\n168\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nwill be subject to public comment and, potentially, judicial review.\nWe expect to have a proposed decision from EPA regarding Cholla sometime in 2024.\n•\nOn May 18, 2023, EPA published a proposal that expands the scope of federal CCR regulations to address the impacts from historical CCR disposal activities that would have ceased prior to 2015.\nEPA proposes to define a new class of CCR management units (“CCRMUs”) that broadly encompass any location at an operating coal-fired power plant where CCR would have been placed on land.\nAs proposed, this would include not only historically closed landfills and surface impoundments but also prior applications of CCR beneficial use.\nEPA expects to finalize this proposal by spring of 2024.\nWe cannot at this time predict the outcome of these regulatory proceedings or when EPA will take final action on those matters that are still pending.\nDepending on the eventual outcome, the costs associated with APS’s management of CCR could materially increase, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAPS currently disposes of CCR in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Cholla and Four Corners.  The Navajo Plant disposed of CCR only in a dry landfill storage area.\nAdditionally, the CCR rule requires ongoing, phased groundwater monitoring.  As of October 2018, APS has completed the statistical analyses for its CCR disposal units that triggered assessment monitoring.\nAPS determined that several of its CCR disposal units at Cholla and Four Corners will need to undergo corrective action.\nIn addition, under the current regulations, all such disposal units must have ceased operating and initiated closure by April 11, 2021, at the latest (except for those disposal units subject to alternative closure).\nAPS completed the assessments of corrective measures on June 14, 2019; however, additional investigations and engineering analyses that will support the remedy selection are still underway.\nIn addition, APS will also solicit input from the public and host public hearings as part of this process.\nAPS’s estimates for its share of corrective action and monitoring costs at Four Corners and Cholla are captured within the Asset Retirement Obligations.\nS\nee Note\n11\n.  As APS continues to implement the CCR rule’s corrective action assessment process, the current cost estimates may change.\nGiven uncertainties that may exist until we have fully completed the corrective action assessment and final remedy selection process, APS cannot predict any ultimate impacts to APS; however, at this time APS does not believe that any potential changes to the cost estimate for Four Corners or Cholla would have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEPA Power Plant Carbon Regulations.\nEPA’s regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from electric utility power plants has proceeded in fits and starts over most of the last decade.\nStarting on August 3, 2015, EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, which was the Agency’s first effort at such regulation through system-wide generation dispatch shifting.\nThose regulations were subsequently repealed by the EPA on June 19, 2019, and replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) regulations, which were a far narrower set of rules.  While the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit subsequently vacated the ACE regulations on January 19, 2021, and ordered a remand for EPA to develop replacement regulations consistent with the original 2015 Clean Power Plan, the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently reversed that decision on June 30, 2022, holding that the Clean Power Plan exceeded EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.\nIn the latest set of proposed rules, released on May 23, 2023, EPA contemplates emission standards and guidelines for various subcategories of new and existing power plants.\nUnlike EPA’s Clean Power\n169\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPlan regulations from 2015, which took a broad, system-wide approach to regulating carbon emissions from electric utility fossil-fuel burning power plants, the most recent proposal is limited to measures that can be installed at individual power plants to limit planet-warming emissions.\nAs such, for new natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants, EPA is proposing that carbon emission performance standards apply based on the annual capacity factors.\nFor the highest utilization combustion turbines, EPA is therefore proposing that such facilities be retrofitted for carbon capture and sequestration or utilization controls (“CCS”) or varying levels of hydrogen gas (“H2”) co-firing.\nAs for existing natural gas-fired combustion turbines, EPA is imposing similar control requirements at large, high utilization generating units, but is otherwise not proceeding at this time with further regulation.\nAs such, under EPA’s proposal, this means that both new and existing peaking gas-fired combustion turbines (i.e., those with a 20% or less annual capacity factor) are effectively unregulated under the proposed regulations.\nFor coal-fired power plants, instead of imposing regulations based on capacity and utilization, EPA has developed subcategories based on planned retirement dates.\nThis means that facilities retiring between 2030 and before 2040 must meet increasingly stringent emission limits up to natural-gas co-firing starting in 2030.\nHowever, for those facilities with no planned retirement date prior to 2040, EPA is requiring those plants to be retrofitted with CCS controls by 2030.\nEPA expects to take final action on this proposal by spring or summer of 2024.\nAt this time, APS cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking or when EPA will take final action.\nIn addition, APS is continuing to evaluate this proposal and its potential impact on APS’s operations.\nDepending on the eventual outcome, the costs associated with APS’s operation of its current and future thermal power plants could materially increase, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOther environmental rules that could involve material compliance costs include those related to effluent limitations, the ozone national ambient air quality standard and other rules or matters involving the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, RCRA, Superfund, the Navajo Nation, and water supplies for our power plants.\nThe financial impact of complying with current and future environmental rules could jeopardize the economic viability of APS’s fossil-fuel powered plants or the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any required equipment upgrades or continue their participation in these plants.\nThe economics of continuing to own certain resources, particularly our coal plants, may deteriorate, warranting early retirement of those plants, which may result in asset impairments.\nAPS would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants, as well as other costs related to early retirement, but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery.\nFour Corners National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) Permit\nThe latest NPDES permit for Four Corners was issued on September 30, 2019.\nBased upon a November 1, 2019, filing by several environmental groups, the Environmental Appeals Board (“EAB”) took up review of the Four Corners NPDES Permit.\nThe EAB denied the environmental group petition on\nSeptember 30, 2020.\nWhile on January 22, 2021, the environmental groups filed a petition for review of the EAB’s decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the parties to the litigation (including APS) finalized a settlement on May 2, 2022.\nThis settlement requires investigation of thermal wastewater discharges from Four Corners, administratively closes the litigation filed in January of 2021, and APS does not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial condition, results\nof operations, or cash flows.\n170\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFour Corners\n—\n4CA Matter\nOn July 6, 2016, 4CA purchased El Paso Electric Company’s\n7\n% interest in Four Corners.  NTEC purchased this\n7\n% interest on July 3, 2018, from 4CA.  NTEC purchased the\n7\n% interest at 4CA’s book value, approximately $\n70\nmillion, and paid 4CA the purchase price over a period of four years pursuant to a secured interest-bearing promissory note, which was paid in full as of June 30, 2022.\nIn connection with the sale, Pinnacle West guaranteed certain obligations that NTEC will have to the other owners of Four Corners, such as NTEC’s\n7\n% share of capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses.  Pinnacle West’s guarantee is secured by a portion of APS’s payments to be owed to NTEC under the 2016 Coal Supply Agreement.\nPNW Power Wind Projects\nIn October 2023, the Tenaska wind farm investments were reorganized such that they are no longer held by BCE, rather they are now held under the new Pinnacle West subsidiary, PNW Power.\nSee Notes 1 and 20 for more information.\nTenaska Clear Creek Wind, LLC, the developer, owner, and operator of the Clear Creek wind farm, has disputed the proposed cost allocation of system upgrades related to connecting the Clear Creek wind farm to the transmission system.  Tenaska Clear Creek Wind, LLC, filed complaints with FERC on this matter on May 21, 2021, and May 25, 2022, both of which FERC has denied.  In April 2023, Tenaska Clear Creek Wind, LLC filed Petitions for Review of the relevant FERC orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which are still pending.\nDue to disputed system upgrades and curtailment issues, the Clear Creek wind farm has experienced a significant reduction in power generation that has had a material adverse impact on the project’s ability to generate cash flow for investors.  During the fourth quarter of 2022, due to these ongoing disputes, cost allocation uncertainties, and no probable favorable resolution, the equity method investment was fully impaired.  Prior to the impairment, the investment had a carrying value of $\n17.1\nmillion, which was written-down to reflect the investment’s estimated fair value of\nzero\nas of December 31, 2022.  Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022, includes an after-tax loss of $\n12.8\nmillion relating to this impairment.\nBCE Kūpono Solar\nBCE and Ameresco jointly owned a special purpose entity that is sponsoring the Kūpono Solar project.  This project is a\n42\nMW solar and battery storage facility in Oʻahu, Hawaii that will supply clean renewable energy and capacity under a\n20\n-year power purchase agreement with Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.  The Kūpono Solar project is expected to be completed in 2024.  On April 18, 2023, the Kūpono Solar special purpose entity entered into a $\n140\nmillion non-recourse construction financing agreement.  The construction financing will convert into a sale leaseback agreement upon commercial operation of the project.  As of December 31, 2023, the construction financing agreement required $\n40\nmillion of sponsor equity, which has been funded by the project’s equity participants and which is subject to adjustment under the construction financing agreement.  In connection with the financing, Pinnacle West has issued performance guarantees relating to the project.  Investments in the Kūpono Solar\n171\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nproject are included in the BCE Sale which closed on January 12, 2024.  Subsequent to the BCE Sale, Pinnacle West continues to maintain the performance guarantees relating to the Kūpono Solar project financing, see additional information below regarding these guarantees.  See Note 20 for information relating to the BCE Sale.\nFinancial Assurances\nIn the normal course of business, we obtain standby letters of credit and surety bonds from financial institutions and other third parties.  These instruments guarantee our own future performance and provide third parties with financial and performance assurance in the event we do not perform.  These instruments support commodity contract collateral obligations and other transactions.  As of December 31, 2023, standby letters of credit totaled approximately $\n27\nmillion and will expire in 2024.  As of December 31, 2023, surety bonds expiring through 2025 totaled approximately $\n20\nmillion.  The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected on our balance sheets, where applicable.  Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the letters of credit and surety bonds themselves.\nWe enter into agreements that include indemnification provisions relating to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements.  Most significantly, APS has agreed to indemnify the equity participants and other parties in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions with respect to certain tax matters.  Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in the indemnification provisions and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnification provisions cannot be reasonably estimated.  Based on historical experience and evaluation of the specific indemnities, we do not believe that any material loss related to such indemnification provisions is likely.\nPinnacle West has issued parental guarantees and has provided indemnification under certain surety bonds for APS which were not material at December 31, 2023.  In connection with the sale of 4CA’s\n7\n% interest to NTEC, Pinnacle West is guaranteeing certain obligations that NTEC will have to the other owners of Four Corners.  See “Four Corners — 4CA Matter” above for information related to this guarantee.  Pinnacle West has not needed to perform under this guarantee.  A maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in the guarantee and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantee cannot be reasonably estimated; however, we consider the fair value of this guarantee, including expected credit losses, to be immaterial.\nIn connection with PNW Power’s investments in minority ownership positions in the Clear Creek wind farm in Missouri and Nobles 2 wind farm in Minnesota, Pinnacle West has guaranteed the obligations of PNW Power to make production tax credit funding payments to borrowers of the projects (the “PTC Guarantees”).\nThe amounts guaranteed by Pinnacle West are reduced as payments are made under the respective guarantee agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there is approximately $\n31\nmillion of remaining guarantees relating to these PTC Guarantees that are expected to terminate by 2030.\nPinnacle West has issued various performance guarantees in connection with BCE’s Kūpono Solar project investment financing, and is exposed to losses relating to these guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events that we do not consider to be reasonably likely to occur.\nSubsequent to the BCE Sale, Pinnacle West continues to maintain these performance guarantees.  See Note 20.  As of December 31, 2023, these performance guarantees had no significant impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe details of the guarantees are as follows:\n172\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n•\nUpon the BCE Sale closing, which occurred on January 12, 2024, Pinnacle West committed to certain performance guarantees tied to the Kūpono project achieving certain construction and operation milestones.  These performance guarantees will expire when the Kūpono project achieves commercial operation, which is expected in 2024.\n•\nWhen the\nKūpono financing coverts to a sale leaseback agreement, which is expected to occur upon commercial operation of the project, Pinnacle West has committed to certain performance guarantees that may apply upon the occurrence of specified events (such as uninsured loss events).  Ameresco has agreed to make efforts to refinance the project and eliminate these guarantees prior to 2030.\n•\nAmeresco is\nobligated to reimburse Pinnacle West for any payments made by Pinnacle West under such guarantees.\n11.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nIn 2023, the Company revised its cost estimates for existing Asset Retirement Obligations (“ARO”) for the following:\n•\nCholla coal-fired power plant related to the closure of ponds and facilities, which resulted in an increase to the ARO of approximately $\n71\nmillion, primarily due to changes in the planned pond closure methodology and increased corrective action cost estimates associated with the CCR Rule.  See Note 10.\n•\nFour Corners coal-fired power plant, which resulted in a decrease of approximately $\n7\nmillion.\n•\nNavajo coal-fired plant, which resulted in an increase of approximately $\n8\nmillion.\n•\nPalo Verde received a new decommissioning study, which resulted in an increase to the ARO in the amount of $\n63\nmillion, an increase in the plant in service of $\n59\nmillion and a decrease in the regulatory liability of $\n4\nmillion.\nIn 2022, APS did not revise any cost estimates related to existing AROs, and no new AROs were necessary.\nSee additional details in Notes 3 and 10.\nThe following table shows the change in our AROs (dollars in thousands):\nIn accordance with regulatory accounting, APS accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets, even if there is no legal obligation for removal.  See detail of regulatory liabilities in Note 3.\n173\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value within the fair value hierarchy.  This hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the inputs used to determine fair values, which are then classified and disclosed in one of three categories.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\nLevel 1 — Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 — Other significant observable inputs, including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable (such as yield curves).\nLevel 3 — Valuation models with significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.  Instruments in this category may include long-dated derivative transactions where valuations are unobservable due to the length of the transaction, options, and transactions in locations where observable market data does not exist.  The valuation models we employ utilize spot prices, forward prices, historical market data and other factors to forecast future prices.\nAssets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Thus, a valuation may be classified in Level 3 even though the valuation may include significant inputs that are readily observable.  We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  We rely primarily on the market approach of using prices and other market information for identical and/or comparable assets and liabilities.  If market data is not readily available, inputs may reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use.  Our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities as well as their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.  We assess whether a market is active by obtaining observable broker quotes, reviewing actual market activity, and assessing the volume of transactions.  We consider broker quotes observable inputs when the quote is binding on the broker, we can validate the quote with market activity, or we can determine that the inputs the broker used to arrive at the quoted price are observable.\nInstruments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are included in our fair value disclosures; however, in accordance with GAAP are not classified within the fair value hierarchy levels.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nWe apply recurring fair value measurements to cash equivalents, derivative instruments, and investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and other special use funds.  On an annual basis, we apply fair value measurements to plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans.  See Note 7 for fair value discussion of plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents represent certain investments in money market funds that are valued using quoted prices in active markets.\n174\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRisk Management Activities — Energy Derivative Instruments\nExchange traded commodity contracts are valued using unadjusted quoted prices.  For non-exchange traded commodity contracts, we calculate fair value based on the average of the bid and offer price, discounted to reflect net present value.  We maintain certain valuation adjustments for a number of risks associated with the valuation of future commitments.  These include valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risks.  The liquidity valuation adjustment represents the cost that would be incurred if all unmatched positions were closed out or hedged.  The credit valuation adjustment represents estimated credit losses on our net exposure to counterparties, taking into account netting agreements, expected default experience for the credit rating of the counterparties and the overall diversification of the portfolio.  We maintain credit policies that management believes minimize overall credit risk.\nCertain non-exchange traded commodity contracts are valued based on unobservable inputs due to the long-term nature of contracts, characteristics of the product, or the unique location of the transactions.  Long-dated energy transactions may consist of observable valuations for the near-term portion and unobservable valuations for the long-term portions of the transaction.  We rely primarily on broker quotes to value these instruments.  When our valuations utilize broker quotes, we perform various control procedures to ensure the quote has been developed consistent with fair value accounting guidance.  These controls include assessing the quote for reasonableness by comparison against other broker quotes, reviewing historical price relationships, and assessing market activity.  When broker quotes are not available, the primary valuation technique used to calculate the fair value is the extrapolation of forward pricing curves using observable market data for more liquid delivery points in the same region and actual transactions at more illiquid delivery points.\nWhen the unobservable portion is significant to the overall valuation of the transaction, the entire transaction is classified as Level 3.\nRisk Management Activities — Interest Rate Derivatives\nOur\ninterest rate derivative instruments\nrelated to a BCE interest rate swap, which was valued using financial models that utilize observable inputs for similar instruments and was classified as Level 2.\nThe interest rate swap is no longer held as of December 31, 2023.\nSee Note 20.\nInvestments Held in Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts and Other Special Use Funds\nThe nuclear decommissioning trusts and other special use funds invest in fixed income and equity securities.  Other special use funds include the coal reclamation escrow account and the active union employee medical account.  See Note 18 for additional discussion about our investment accounts.\nWe value investments in fixed income and equity securities using information provided by our trustees and escrow agent.  Our trustees and escrow agent use pricing services that utilize the valuation methodologies described below to determine fair market value.  We have internal control procedures designed to ensure this information is consistent with fair value accounting guidance.  These procedures include assessing valuations using an independent pricing source, verifying that pricing can be supported by actual recent market transactions, assessing hierarchy classifications, comparing investment returns with benchmarks, and obtaining and reviewing independent audit reports on the trustees’ and escrow agent’s internal operating controls and valuation processes.\n175\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFixed Income Securities\nFixed income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury are valued using quoted active market prices and are typically classified as Level 1.  Fixed income securities issued by corporations, municipalities, and other agencies, including mortgage-backed instruments, are valued using quoted inactive market prices, quoted active market prices for similar securities, or by utilizing calculations which incorporate observable inputs such as yield curves and spreads relative to such yield curves.  These fixed income instruments are classified as Level 2.  Whenever possible, multiple market quotes are obtained which enables a cross-check validation.  A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class, or issue of securities.\nFixed income securities may also include short-term investments in certificates of deposit, variable rate notes, time deposit accounts, U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, commercial paper, and other short-term instruments.  These instruments are valued using active market prices or utilizing observable inputs described above.\nEquity Securities\nThe nuclear decommissioning trusts’ equity security investments are held indirectly through commingled funds.  The commingled funds are valued using the funds’ NAV as a practical expedient.  The funds’ NAV is primarily derived from the quoted active market prices of the underlying equity securities held by the funds.  We may transact in these commingled funds on a semi-monthly basis at the NAV.  The commingled funds are maintained by a bank and hold investments in accordance with the stated objective of tracking the performance of the S&P 500 Index.  Because the commingled funds’ shares are offered to a limited group of investors, they are not considered to be traded in an active market.  As these instruments are valued using NAV, as a practical expedient, they have not been classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe nuclear decommissioning trusts and other special use funds may also hold equity securities that include exchange traded mutual funds and money market accounts for short-term liquidity purposes.  These short-term, highly-liquid investments are valued using active market prices.\n176\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value Tables\nThe following table presents the fair value at December 31, 2023, of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nRepresents counterparty netting, margin, and collateral.  See Note 15.\n(b)\nRepresents net pending securities sales and purchases.\n(c)\nValued using NAV as a practical expedient and, therefore, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n177\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the fair value at December 31, 2022, of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nRepresents counterparty netting, margin, and collateral.  See Note 15.\n(b)\nRepresents net pending securities sales and purchases.\n(c)\nValued using NAV as a practical expedient and, therefore, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n178\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value Measurements Classified as Level 3\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our energy derivative contracts include broker quotes that cannot be validated as an observable input primarily due to the long-term nature of the quote or other characteristics of the product.  Significant changes in these inputs in isolation would result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements.  Changes in our derivative contract fair values, including changes relating to unobservable inputs, typically will not impact net income due to regulatory accounting treatment.  See Note 3.\nBecause our forward commodity contracts classified as Level 3 are currently in a net purchase position, we would expect price increases of the underlying commodity to result in increases in the net fair value of the related contracts.  Conversely, if the price of the underlying commodity decreases, the net fair value of the related contracts would likely decrease.\nOther unobservable valuation inputs include credit and liquidity reserves which do not have a material impact on our valuations; however, significant changes in these inputs could also result in higher or lower fair value measurements.\nThe following tables provide information regarding our significant unobservable inputs used to value our risk management derivative Level 3 instruments at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022:\n(a)\nIncludes swaps and physical and financial contracts.\n(b)\nUnobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instrument.\n(a)\nIncludes swaps and physical and financial contracts.\n(b)\nUnobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instrument.\n179\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows the changes in fair value for our risk management activities’ assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs (dollars in thousands):\nTransfers in or out of Level 3 are typically related to our long-dated energy transactions that extend beyond available quoted periods.\nFinancial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value\nThe carrying value of our short-term borrowings approximate fair value and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  See Note 6 for our long-term debt fair values.\n13.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table presents the calculation of Pinnacle West’s basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n14.\nStock-Based Compensation\nPinnacle West has incentive compensation plans under which stock-based compensation is granted to officers, key-employees, and non-officer members of the Board of Directors.  Awards granted under the 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2021 Plan”) may be in the form of stock grants, restricted stock units, stock units, performance shares, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, performance share units, performance cash, incentive and non-qualified stock options, and stock appreciation rights.  The 2021 Plan\n180\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nauthorizes up to\n4.3\nmillion common shares to be available for grant.  As of December 31, 2023,\n3.5\nmillion common shares were available for issuance under the 2021 Plan.  During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted awards in the form of restricted stock units, stock units, stock grants, and performance shares.  Awards granted from 2012 to May 2021 were issued under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2012 Plan”), and awards granted from 2007 to 2011 were issued under the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2007 Plan”).  No new awards may be granted under the 2012 or 2007 Plans.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense and Activity\nCompensation cost included in net income for stock-based compensation plans was $\n17\nmillion in 2023, $\n16\nmillion in 2022, and $\n18\nmillion in 2021.  The compensation cost capitalized is immaterial for all years.  Income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements were $\n3\nmillion in 2023, $\n2\nmillion in 2022, and $\n3\nmillion in 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were approximately $\n31\nmillion of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements.  We expect to recognize these costs over a weighted-average period of\ntwo years\n.\nThe total fair value of shares vested was $\n24\nmillion in 2023, $\n25\nmillion in 2022, and $\n22\nmillion in 2021.\nThe following table is a summary of awards granted and the weighted-average grant date fair value for each of the last three years:\n(a)\nUnits granted includes awards that will be cash settled of\n0\nin 2023,\n0\nin 2022, and\n51,074\nin 2021.  See below for additional information on restricted stock unit grants.\n(b)\nReflects the target payout level.\n181\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows the change of nonvested awards:\n(a)\nIncludes\n34,367\nof awards that will be cash settled.\n(b)\nThe performance shares are reflected at target payout level.\n(c)\nWe account for forfeitures as they occur.\nShare-based liabilities paid relating to restricted stock units were $\n6\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion, and $\n4\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  This includes cash used to settle restricted stock units of $\n3\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion, and $\n3\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Restricted stock units that are cash settled are classified as liability awards.  All performance shares are classified as equity awards.\nRestricted Stock Units, Stock Grants, and Stock Units\nRestricted stock units are granted to officers and key employees and typically vest and settle in equal annual installments over a\n4\n-year period after the grant date.  Vesting is typically dependent upon continuous service during the vesting period.\nBeginning in 2022, restricted stock unit awards are issued in stock.  Awards include a dividend equivalent feature that allows each award to accrue dividends and treat them as reinvested, from the date of grant until the applicable vesting date.  If the award is forfeited the employee is not entitled to the accrued reinvested dividends on those shares.  Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees will vest on a pro-rata basis upon the employee’s retirement.\nPrior to 2022, awardees typically elected to receive payment in either\n100\n% stock,\n100\n% cash, or\n50\n% in cash and\n50\n% in stock.  Awards included a dividend equivalent feature that accrued dividend rights from the date of grant until the applicable vesting date, plus interest compounded quarterly.  If the award was forfeited, the employee was not entitled to the accrued dividends on those shares.  Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees typically vested upon the employee’s retirement.\nCompensation cost for restricted stock unit awards is based on the fair value of the award, with the fair value being the market price of our stock on the measurement date.  Restricted stock unit awards that will be settled in cash are accounted for as liability awards, with compensation cost initially calculated on the date of grant using the Company’s closing stock price and remeasured at each balance sheet date.\n182\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRestricted stock unit awards that will be settled in shares are accounted for as equity awards, with compensation cost calculated using the Company’s closing stock price on the date of grant.  Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the award.\nStock grants are issued to non-officer members of the Board of Directors.  They may elect to receive the stock grant, or to defer receipt until a later date and receive stock units in lieu of the stock grant.  Beginning in 2023, payments for stock units are issued in stock and include a dividend equivalent feature that allows each award to accrue dividends and treat them as reinvested, from the date of grant until the applicable vesting date. Prior to 2023, members of the Board of Directors who elected to defer could elect to receive payment in either\n100\n% stock,\n100\n% cash, or\n50\n% in cash and\n50\n% in stock.  The stock units prior to 2023 included a dividend equivalent feature that accrues dividend rights from the date of grant to the date of payment, plus interest compounded quarterly.\nPerformance Share Awards\nPerformance share awards are granted to officers and key employees.  The awards contain separate performance metric criteria that affect the number of shares that may be received if, after the end of a\n3\n-year performance period, the performance criteria are met.\nBeginning in 2022, performance share awards contain\nthree\nseparate, unrelated performance criteria.\nThe first performance criteria is based upon Pinnacle West’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) in relation to the TSR of other companies in a specified utility index (i.e., the TSR component).\nThe second performance criteria is based upon Pinnacle West’s earnings per share (“EPS”) performance relative to an approved target (i.e., the EPS component).\nThe third performance criteria is based upon APS’s clean MW installed of renewable or other carbon free resources compared to the approved target (i.e., the Clean component).\nThe exact number of shares issued is calculated separately for each performance component and can vary from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target award for each separate performance criteria.  Shares received include a dividend equivalent feature that treats accrued dividends as reinvested, from the date of grant until the date of payment, equal to the number of vested performance shares.  If the award is forfeited or if the performance criteria are not achieved, the employee is not entitled to the dividends on those shares.  Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees will vest on a pro-rata basis upon the employee’s retirement.\nPrior to 2022, performance share awards had\ntwo\nperformance criteria.  The first performance criteria was based upon non-financial performance metrics (i.e., the Metric component).  The second performance criteria was based upon Pinnacle West’s TSR in relation to the TSR of other companies in a specified utility index (i.e., the TSR component).  The exact number of shares issued will vary from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target award.  Shares received included a dividend equivalent feature that allows accrued dividend rights from the date of grant until the date of payment, plus interest compounded quarterly, equal to the number of vested performance shares.  If the award was forfeited, the employee was not entitled to the accrued dividends on those shares.  Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees typically vested upon the employee’s retirement.\nPerformance share awards are accounted for as equity awards, with compensation cost based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.  Compensation cost relating to the EPS, Clean and Metric component of the respective awards is based on the Company’s closing stock price on the date of grant, with compensation cost recognized over the requisite service period based on the number of shares\n183\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nexpected to vest.  Management evaluates the probability of meeting the EPS, Clean and Metric component at each balance sheet date.  If the EPS, Clean and Metric component criteria are not ultimately achieved, no compensation cost is recognized relating to the EPS, Clean and Metric component, and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.  Compensation cost relating to the TSR component of the respective awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model, with compensation cost recognized ratably over the requisite service period, regardless of the number of shares that actually vest.\n15.\nDerivative Accounting\nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to commodity price and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas, emissions allowances, and interest rates.  Risks associated with market volatility are managed by utilizing various physical and financial derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options, and swaps.  As part of our overall risk management program, we may use derivative instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas.  Derivative instruments that meet certain hedge accounting criteria may be designated as cash flow hedges and are used to limit our exposure to cash flow variability on forecasted transactions.  The changes in market value of such instruments have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged transactions.  Derivative instruments are also entered into for economic hedging purposes.  While economic hedges may mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, these instruments have not been designated as accounting hedges.  Contracts that have the same terms (quantities, delivery points and delivery periods) and for which power does not flow are netted, which reduces both revenues and fuel and purchased power costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income, but does not impact our financial condition, net income, or cash flows.\nOur derivative instruments, excluding those qualifying for a scope exception, are recorded on the balance sheets as an asset or liability and are measured at fair value.  See Note 12 for a discussion of fair value measurements.  Derivative instruments may qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception if they require physical delivery, and the quantities represent those transacted in the normal course of business.  Derivative instruments qualifying for the normal purchases and sales scope exception are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting and excluded from our derivative instrument discussion and disclosures below.\nEnergy Derivatives\nFor its regulated operations, APS defers for future rate treatment\n100\n% of the unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives pursuant to the PSA mechanism that would otherwise be recognized in income.  Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives are deferred in accordance with the PSA to the extent the amounts are above or below the Base Fuel Rate.  See Note 3.  Gains and losses from energy derivatives in the following tables represent the amounts reflected in income before the effect of PSA deferrals.\nThe following table shows the outstanding gross notional volume of energy derivatives, which represent both purchases and sales (does not reflect net position):\n184\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGains and Losses from Energy Derivative Instruments\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, APS had no energy derivative instruments in designated accounting hedging relationships.\nThe following table provides information about gains and losses from energy derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedging instruments (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nAmounts are before the effect of PSA deferrals.\nEnergy Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nOur energy derivative transactions are typically executed under standardized or customized agreements, which include collateral requirements and, in the event of a default, would allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.  Agreements that allow for the offsetting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty are considered master netting arrangements.  Transactions with counterparties that have master netting arrangements are offset and reported net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Transactions that do not allow for offsetting of positive and negative positions are reported gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe do not offset a counterparty’s current energy derivative contracts with the counterparty’s non-current energy derivative contracts, although our master netting arrangements would allow current and non-current positions to be offset in the event of a default.  These types of transactions may include non-derivative instruments, derivatives qualifying for scope exceptions, trade receivables and trade payables arising from settled positions, and other forms of non-cash collateral (such as letters of credit).  These types of transactions are excluded from the offsetting tables presented below.\n185\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables provide information about the fair value of APS’s risk management activities reported on a gross basis and the impacts of offsetting.  These amounts relate to commodity contracts and are located in the assets and liabilities from risk management activities lines of APS’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a)\nAll of our gross recognized derivative instruments were subject to master netting arrangements.\n(b)\nIncludes cash collateral provided to counterparties of $\n9,200\nthousand that is subject to offsetting.\n(c)\nRepresents cash collateral and cash margin that is not subject to offsetting.  Amounts relate to non-derivative instruments, derivatives qualifying for scope exceptions, or collateral and margin posted in excess of the recognized derivative instrument.  Includes cash collateral received from counterparties of $\n6,071\nthousand and cash margin provided to counterparties of $\n5\nthousand.\n(a)\nAll of our gross recognized derivative instruments were subject to master netting arrangements.\n(b)\nNo\ncash collateral has been provided to counterparties, or received from counterparties, that is subject to offsetting.\n(c)\nRepresents cash collateral and cash margin that is not subject to offsetting.  Amounts relate to non-derivative instruments, derivatives qualifying for scope exceptions, or collateral and margin posted in excess of the recognized derivative instrument.  Includes cash collateral received from counterparties of $\n5,835\nthousand and cash margin provided to counterparties of $\n28\nthousand.\n186\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInterest Rate Derivatives\nOn October 19, 2022, Bright Canyon Energy entered into an interest rate swap to hedge the variable interest rate exposure relating to the credit agreement for the Los Alamitos project.  The transaction qualified and had been designated as a cash flow hedge.  The interest rate swap was included in the BCE Sale, and was assumed by Ameresco as part of the first stage of the closing.  See Note 20.  Prior to being transferred in the BCE Sale, the interest rate swap was in an asset position valued at $\n0.2\nmillion.  As of December 31, 2023, the interest rate swap has no impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCredit Risk and Credit Related Contingent Features\nWe are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by energy derivative counterparties and have risk management contracts with many energy derivative counterparties.  As of December 31, 2023, we have no counterparties with positive exposures of greater than 10% of Pinnacle West’s risk management assets.  Our risk management process assesses and monitors the financial exposure of all counterparties.  Despite the fact that the great majority of our trading counterparties’ debt is rated as investment grade by the credit rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these counterparties could default, resulting in a material impact on consolidated earnings for a given period.  Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of financial institutions, major energy companies, municipalities, and local distribution companies.  We maintain credit policies that we believe minimize overall credit risk to within acceptable limits.  Determination of the credit quality of our counterparties is based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings and our evaluation of their financial condition.  To manage credit risk, we employ collateral requirements and standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.  Valuation adjustments are established representing our estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to counterparties.\nCertain of our energy derivative instrument contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features including, among other things, investment grade credit rating provisions, credit-related cross-default provisions, and adequate assurance provisions.  Adequate assurance provisions allow a counterparty with reasonable grounds for uncertainty to demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions.  For those energy derivative instruments in a net liability position, with investment grade credit contingencies, the counterparties could demand additional collateral if our debt credit rating were to fall below investment grade (below BBB- for Standard & Poor’s or Fitch or Baa3 for Moody’s).\nThe following table provides information about our energy derivative instruments that have credit-risk-related contingent features (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nThis amount is after counterparty netting and includes those contracts which qualify for scope exceptions, which are excluded from the derivative details above.\n187\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe also have energy related non-derivative instrument contracts with investment grade credit-related contingent features, which could also require us to post additional collateral of approximately $\n205\nmillion if our debt credit ratings were to fall below investment grade.\n16.\nOther Income and Other Expense\nThe following table provides detail of Pinnacle West’s Consolidated other income and other expense for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nThe 2023 interest income is primarily related to PSA Interest.  See Note 3.\n(b)\nThe 2022 investment loss is primarily related to an impairment of PNW Power’s Clear Creek wind farm investment.  See Note 10.\n(c)\nThe 2022 miscellaneous amount includes donations of $7 million to the APS Foundation.\nOther Income and Other Expense - APS\nThe following table provides detail of APS’s other income and other expense for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nThe 2023 interest income is primarily related to PSA Interest.  See Note 3.\n(b)\nThe 2022 miscellaneous amount includes donations of $\n7\nmillion to the APS Foundation.\n188\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17.\nPalo Verde Sale Leaseback Variable Interest Entities\nIn 1986, APS entered into agreements with\nthree\nseparate VIE lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2 and related common facilities.  APS will retain the assets through 2033 under all\nthree\nlease agreements.\nAPS will be required to make payments relating to the\nthree\nleases in total of approximately\n$\n21\nmillion\nannually for the period 2024 through 2033.  At the end of the lease period, APS will have the option to purchase the leased assets at their fair market value, extend the leases for up to\ntwo years\n, or return the assets to the lessors.\nThe leases’ terms give APS the ability to utilize the assets for a significant portion of the assets’ economic life, and therefore provide APS with the power to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance.  Predominantly due to the lease terms, APS has been deemed the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and therefore consolidates the VIEs.\nAs a result of consolidation, we eliminate lease accounting and instead recognize depreciation expense, resulting in an increase in net income of $\n17\nmillion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The increase in net income is entirely attributable to the noncontrolling interests.  Income attributable to Pinnacle West shareholders is not impacted by the consolidation.\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts relating to the VIEs (dollars in thousands):\nAssets of the VIEs are restricted and may only be used for payment to the noncontrolling interest holders.  These assets are reported on our consolidated financial statements.\nAPS is exposed to losses relating to these VIEs upon the occurrence of certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur.  Under certain circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to make specified payments to the VIEs’ noncontrolling equity participants and take title to the leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written-down in value.  If such an event were to occur during the lease periods, APS may be required to pay the noncontrolling equity participants approximately $\n334\nmillion beginning in 2024, and up to $\n501\nmillion over the lease extension terms.\nFor regulatory ratemaking purposes, the agreements continue to be treated as operating leases and, as a result, we have recorded a regulatory asset relating to the arrangements.\n18.\nInvestments in Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts and Other Special Use Funds\nWe have investments in debt and equity securities held in Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts, Coal Reclamation Escrow Account, and an Active Union Employee Medical Account.  Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.  We record both debt and equity security\n189\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ninvestments at their fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  See Note 12 for a discussion of how fair value is determined and the classification of the investments within the fair value hierarchy.  The investments in each trust or account are restricted for use and are intended to fund specified costs and activities as further described for each fund below.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trusts —\nAPS established external decommissioning trusts in accordance with NRC regulations to fund the future costs APS expects to incur to decommission Palo Verde.  Third-party investment managers are authorized to buy and sell securities per stated investment guidelines.  The trust funds are invested in fixed income securities and equity securities.  Earnings and proceeds from sales and maturities of securities are reinvested in the trusts.  Because of the ability of APS to recover decommissioning costs in rates, and in accordance with the regulatory treatment, APS has deferred realized and unrealized gains and losses (including credit losses) in other regulatory liabilities.\nCoal Reclamation Escrow Account —\nAPS has investments restricted for the future coal mine reclamation funding related to Four Corners.  This escrow account is primarily invested in fixed income securities.  Earnings and proceeds from sales of securities are reinvested in the escrow account.  Because of the ability of APS to recover coal reclamation costs in rates, and in accordance with the regulatory treatment, APS has deferred realized and unrealized gains and losses (including credit losses) in other regulatory liabilities.  Activities relating to APS coal mine reclamation escrow account investments are included within the other special use funds in the table below.\nActive Union Employee Medical Account —\nAPS has investments restricted for paying active union employee medical costs.  These investments may be used to pay active union employee medical costs incurred in the current and future periods.  In 2023 and 2022, APS was reimbursed $\n14\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion, respectively, for prior year active union employee medical claims from the active union employee medical account.  The account is invested primarily in fixed income securities.  In accordance with the ratemaking treatment, APS has deferred the unrealized gains and losses (including credit losses) in other regulatory liabilities.  Activities relating to active union employee medical account investments are included within the other special use funds in the table below.\n190\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPS\nThe following tables present the unrealized gains and losses based on the original cost of the investment and summarizes the fair value of APS’s nuclear decommissioning trusts and other special use fund assets (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis of these available-for-sale investments is $\n1,120\nmillion.\n(b)\nRepresents net pending securities sales and purchases.\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2022, the amortized cost basis of these available-for-sale investments is $\n927\nmillion.\n(b)\nRepresents net pending securities sales and purchases.\n191\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table sets forth APS’s realized gains and losses relating to the sale and maturity of available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities, and the proceeds from the sale and maturity of these investment securities (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nProceeds are reinvested in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and other special use funds, excluding amounts reimbursed to the Company for active union employee medical claims from the active union employee medical account.\nFixed Income Securities Contractual Maturities\nThe fair value of APS’s fixed income securities, summarized by contractual maturities, at December 31, 2023, is as follows (dollars in thousands):\n192\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n19.\nChanges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table shows the changes in Pinnacle West’s consolidated accumulated other comprehensive loss, including reclassification adjustments, net of tax, by component (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nThese amounts primarily represent amortization of actuarial loss and are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.  See Note 7.\nChanges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss — APS\nThe following table shows the changes in APS’s consolidated accumulated other comprehensive loss, including reclassification adjustments, net of tax, by component (dollars in thousands):\n(a)\nThese amounts primarily represent amortization of actuarial loss and are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.  See Note 7.\n193\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n20.\nSale of Bright Canyon Energy\nOn August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of our equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary, BCE, to Ameresco.\nThe transaction is accounted for as the sale of a business and was structured to close in multiple stages that were completed on January 12, 2024.\nCertain investments and assets that BCE previously held, including the TransCanyon joint venture and holdings in the two Tenaska wind farm investments, were not included in the BCE Sale and were instead transferred to PNW Power, a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West.\nThe BCE Sale did not include a $\n31\nmillion equity bridge loan relating to BCE’s Los Alamitos project, which was paid in full by Pinnacle West on\nAugust 4, 2023.\nOther than these retained investments and the debt instrument, all BCE assets and liabilities were included in the BCE Sale and were transferred to Ameresco.\nThe first stage of the BCE Sale closed on August 4, 2023, with the carrying value of net assets transferred to Ameresco totaling $\n44\nmillion, which included a $\n36\nmillion construction term loan.\nSee Note 6.\nThe assets and liabilities transferred in this stage related to the BCE Los Alamitos project and were previously primarily classified as construction work in progress and current maturities of long-term debt, respectively.\nOur Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2023, includes a pretax gain of $\n6\nmillion relating to this stage of the BCE Sale reported within other income.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023, includes a $\n28\nmillion note receivable from Ameresco relating to this initial stage of the BCE Sale, which was received in full by Pinnacle West on January 29, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our Consolidated Balance Sheets also include $\n35\nmillion of assets classified as held for sale, relating to the remaining assets of BCE that transferred to Ameresco on    January 12, 2024, in the second stage of the sale.\nThese assets held for sale include BCE’s investment in the Kūpono Solar project, and other projects in various stages of development.\nThe completion of the second stage of the BCE Sale was subject to various conditions precedent, including third-party consents which have been obtained.\nPrior to being classified as held for sale, these assets were primarily included in the other assets line item within the investments and other assets section on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe measure assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, no impairment loss was recognized related to the assets classified as held for sale.\nThe purchase and sale agreement, as amended, provided for Pinnacle West to purchase, from Ameresco, approximately $\n28\nmillion of investment tax credits that were generated by the assets included in the BCE Sale.  The tax credits were purchased and transferred to Pinnacle West on January 30, 2024.\nAs of January 12, 2024, all stages of the BCE Sale have been completed.  The purchase and sale agreement, as amended, allows Ameresco to make certain deferred payments relating to the BCE Sale throughout 2024.  Pinnacle West continues to maintain certain performance guarantees relating to the BCE Kūpono Solar project financing which were not transferred in the BCE Sale transaction.  See Note 10.\n194\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n21.\nNew Accounting Standards\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, a new accounting standard was issued that changes disclosures relating to reportable segments.  The new guidance expands the disclosure requirements relating to reportable segments, including requiring entities to disclose information about a reportable segment’s significant expenses, among other changes.  The amended guidance does not change how an entity identifies reportable segments or the accounting for segments.  The new standard is effective for us, using a retrospective approach, on December 31, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of the new guidance may result in changes to our reportable segment disclosures, but will not impact our segment accounting or financial statement results.\nASU 2023-09, Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, a new accounting standard was issued that expands disclosures relating to income taxes.  The changes require entities to include a tabular income tax rate reconciliation, disclose details on specific reconciliation categories and reconciling items, and disclose the amount of income taxes paid by jurisdiction, among other disclosure changes.  The standard is effective for us on December 31, 2025, using a prospective approach, and may be early adopted.  The adoption of the new guidance may result in changes to our income tax disclosures, but will not impact our accounting for income taxes or our financial statement results.\n195\nPINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION HOLDING COMPANY\nSCHEDULE I — CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT\nCONDENSED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(dollars in thousands)\nSee Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n196\nPINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION HOLDING COMPANY\nSCHEDULE I — CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT\nCONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS\n(dollars in thousands)\nSee Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n197\nPINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION HOLDING COMPANY\nSCHEDULE I — CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT\nCONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(dollars in thousands)\nSee Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n198\nPINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION HOLDING COMPANY\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF HOLDING COMPANY\nThe Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 should be read in conjunction with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Holding Company Financial Statements.\nThe Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Holding Company Financial Statements have been prepared to present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Pinnacle West on a stand-alone basis as a holding company.
