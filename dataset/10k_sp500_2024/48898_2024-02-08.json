    "text": "Hubbell Incorporated (herein referred to as “Hubbell”, the “Company”, the “registrant”, “we”, “our” or “us”, which references shall include its divisions and subsidiaries as the context may require) was founded as a proprietorship in 1888, and was incorporated in Connecticut in 1905. Recognized for our innovation, quality, and deep commitment to serving our customers for over 135 years, Hubbell is a world-class manufacturer of electrical and utility solutions, with more than 75 brands used around the world. We provide utility and electrical solutions that enable our customers to operate critical infrastructure reliably and efficiently, and we empower and energize communities through innovative solutions supporting energy infrastructure In Front of the Meter, on The Edge, and Behind the Meter. In Front of the Meter is where utilities transmit and distribute energy to their customers. The Edge connects utilities with owner/operators and allows energy and data to be distributed back and forth. Behind the Meter is where owners and operators of building and other critical infrastructure consume energy.\nOur products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico, the People’s Republic of China (“China”), the United Kingdom (“UK”), Brazil, Australia, Spain, Ireland, and the Republic of the Philippines. Hubbell also participates in joint ventures in Hong Kong and the Republic of the Philippines, and maintains offices in Singapore, Italy, China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Chile, and countries in the Middle East.\nThe Company’s reporting segments consist of the Utility Solutions segment and the Electrical Solutions segment.\nThe Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at\nhttp://www.hubbell.com\nas soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. The information contained on the Company’s website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report.\nUtility Solutions Segment\nHubbell Utility Solutions has leading positions In Front of the Meter and at The Edge. The Utility Solutions segment (61% of consolidated revenues in 2023, 58% in 2022 and 56% in 2021) consists of businesses that design, manufacture, and sell a wide variety of electrical distribution, transmission, substation, and telecommunications products, which support applications In Front of the Meter. This includes utility transmission & distribution (T&D) components such as arresters, insulators, connectors, anchors, bushings, enclosures, cutouts and switches. The Utility Solutions segment also offers solutions that serve The Edge of the utility infrastructure, including smart meters, communications systems, and protection and control devices. Hubbell Utility Solutions supports the electrical distribution, electrical transmission, water, gas distribution, telecommunications, and solar and wind markets. While Hubbell believes its sales in this area are not materially dependent upon any customer or group of customers, a substantial variability in purchases by electrical utilities would affect this segment.\nOn December 12, 2023 the Company acquired Northern Star Holdings, Inc. (\"Systems Control\") for approximately $1.1 billion, net of cash acquired, subject to customary purchase price adjustments (the \"Systems Control Acquisition\"). Systems Control is a manufacturer of substation control and relay panels, as well as turnkey substation control building solutions. This acquisition enhances Hubbell Utility Solutions' industry-leading franchise across utility components, communications and controls.\nProducts of the Utility Solutions segment are sold under the following brands and/or trademarks:\nElectrical Solutions Segment\nHubbell Electrical Solutions is positioned Behind the Meter, providing key components to building operators and industrial customers that enable them to manage their energy and operate critical infrastructure more efficiently and effectively. The Electrical Solutions segment (39% of consolidated revenues in 2023, 42% in 2022 and 44% in 2021) comprises businesses that sell stock and custom products including standard and special application wiring device products, rough-in electrical products, connector and grounding products, and lighting fixtures, as well as other electrical equipment.\nProducts of the Electrical Solutions segment have applications in the light industrial, non-residential, wireless communications, transportation, data center, and heavy industrial markets. Electrical Solutions segment products are typically used in and around industrial, commercial and institutional facilities by electrical contractors, maintenance personnel, electricians, utilities, and telecommunications companies. In addition, certain of our businesses design and manufacture industrial controls and communication systems used in the non-residential and industrial markets. Many of these products are designed such that they can also be used in harsh and hazardous locations where a potential for fire and explosion exists due to the presence of flammable gasses and vapors. Harsh and hazardous products are primarily used in the oil and gas (onshore and offshore) and mining industries. We also offer a variety of lighting fixtures, wiring devices and electrical products that have residential and utility applications, including residential products with Internet-of-Things (\"IoT\") enabled technologies.\nIn December 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its residential lighting business for a cash purchase price of $131 million, subject to customary adjustments. The residential lighting business sells indoor and outdoor lighting solutions. The business generated $187.1 million in sales in 2023. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024. The assets and liabilities of this business are recorded in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023.\nProducts of the Electrical Solutions segment are sold under various brands and/or trademarks and are primarily sold through electrical and industrial distributors, home centers, retail and hardware outlets, lighting showrooms and residential product oriented internet sites. Special application products are primarily sold through wholesale distributors to contractors, industrial customers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). Brands and/or trademarks of products of the Electrical Solutions segment include:\n*Brand is part of the residential lighting business, which is part of the pending sale discussed above.\nInformation Applicable to Our Business\nInternational Operations\nThe Company has several operations located outside of the United States. These operations manufacture, assemble and/or procure and market Hubbell products and services for both the Utility Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments.\nSee Note 21 — Industry Segments and Geographic Area Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors relating to manufacturing in and sourcing from foreign countries.\nCustomers\nWe have an extensive customer base of distributors, wholesalers, electric utilities, OEMs, electrical contractors, telecommunications companies and retail and hardware outlets. We are not dependent on a single customer, however, our top ten customers account for approximately 42% of our Net sales.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials used in the manufacture of Hubbell products primarily include steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, zinc, nickel, plastics, phenolics, elastomers and petrochemicals. Hubbell also purchases certain electrical and electronic components, including solenoids, lighting ballasts, printed circuit boards, integrated circuit chips and cord sets, from a number of suppliers. Hubbell is not materially dependent upon any one supplier for raw materials used in the manufacture of its products and equipment however the cost and supply of these materials may be affected by disruptions in availability of raw materials, components or sourced finished goods. See also Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nPatents\nHubbell has approximately 3,100 active United States and foreign patents covering a portion of its products, which expire at various times. While Hubbell deems these patents to be of value, it does not consider its business to be dependent upon patent protection. Hubbell also licenses products under patents owned by others, as necessary, and grants licenses under certain of its patents.\nWorking Capital\nInventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable levels, payment terms and, where applicable, return policies are in accordance with the general practices of the electrical products industry and standard business procedures. See also Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nBacklog\nSubstantially all of the backlog existing at December 31, 2023 in the Electrical Solutions segment is expected to be shipped to customers in 2024. In the Utility Solutions segment, substantially all of the backlog existing at December 31, 2023 is expected to be shipped during 2024, along with\n$200 million\nof backlog of contracts that span multiple years, primarily related to long-term contracts of the Aclara business to deliver and install meters and grid monitoring sensor technology. The backlog of orders believed to be firm at December 31, 2023 was $2,328 million compared to $2,463 million at December 31, 2022. Although this backlog is important, the majority of Hubbell’s revenues result from sales of inventoried products or products that have short periods of manufacture.\nCompetition\nHubbell experiences substantial competition in all categories of its business, but does not compete with the same companies in all of its product categories. The number and size of competitors vary considerably depending on the product line. Hubbell cannot specify with precision the number of competitors in each product category or their relative market position. However, some of its competitors are larger companies with substantial financial and other resources. Hubbell considers product performance, reliability, quality and technological innovation to be important factors relevant to all areas of its business and considers its reputation as a manufacturer of quality products to be an important factor in its business. In addition, product price, service levels and other factors can affect Hubbell’s ability to compete.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment. The Company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury to its employees and its customers’ employees and that the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations.\nLike other companies engaged in similar businesses, the Company has incurred or acquired through business combinations, remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination, and is a party to product liability and other lawsuits and claims associated with environmental matters, including past production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. However, considering past experience and reserves, the Company does not anticipate that these matters will have a material adverse effect on earnings, capital expenditures, financial condition or competitive position. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 16 — Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHuman Capital\nOur commitment to developing our employees is one of four pillars that guide Hubbell as a company. We recruit, hire, and develop talent that meets and anticipates the ever-changing needs of our enterprise, while fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace. Hubbell provides market competitive compensation, health and well-being programs, and retirement benefits based on the countries and markets in which we operate to motivate market-leading performance.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Hubbell had approximately 18,317 salaried and hourly employees of whom approximately 11,182, or 61% are located in the United States. Approximately 2,332 of these U.S. employees are represented by 8 labor unions. Hubbell considers its labor relations to be satisfactory and regularly engages with its labor unions.\nHubbell is committed to fostering an environment that respects and encourages individual differences, diversity of thought, and talent. We strive to create a workplace where employees feel that their contributions are welcomed and valued, allowing them to fully engage their talents and training in their work, while generating personal satisfaction in their role within Hubbell. Hubbell has created a multi-year, enterprise-wide strategy dedicated to evolving our inclusive culture while addressing underrepresentation where it exists across our company. As of December 31, 2023, 33% of our employees identify as female, and within the United States, 32% identify as female and 41% are racially diverse.\nAcross the enterprise, there are a variety of ways we invest in our people to learn - on the job, in the classroom, through self-directed learning, or through leadership programs. We have expanded our learning management system (known as Hubbell University) to make new content and training available to our employees. The Company has also expanded leadership development programs to provide career development to employees at all levels and continues to expand its Campus Programs to foster a pipeline of early career talent at Hubbell.\nThe Company also encourages its employees to give back to their communities. The Company supports employees’ spirit of volunteerism in their communities throughout the year with its Volunteer Paid Time Off policy, which provides all employees with up to 8 hours of paid time off a year to volunteer with an eligible 501(c)(3) charity of their choice.\nAs a manufacturing company, we focus on protecting the health and safety of our employees. In 2023, the Company hosted a Culture of Safety Summit with safety and plant leaders from across the enterprise, focused on ensuring that employees Think Safe, Work Safe and Go Home Safe. We dedicate resources to track and monitor safety and recordable incidents using an enterprise-wide data management system. Through the Company’s myLife program, the Company provides comprehensive, competitive benefits that retain and support our employees supporting their health, wealth and peace of mind.\nIn 2023, Hubbell again conducted an enterprise-wide employee survey, the Elevate Employee Experience Survey, to better understand the voices of our employees worldwide. Elevate was the largest survey conducted by the Company and approximately 84% of Hubbell’s employees responded, providing insights that the Company developed into action plans to continue to drive employee engagement at the enterprise and local level.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\n(1)\nAs of February 8, 2024, there are no family relationships among any of the above executive officers and any of our directors. For information related to our Board of Directors, refer to Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance."

    "text": "Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to those set forth below. Any one of these factors could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or future anticipated results. See also Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis — “Executive Overview of the Business” and “Results of Operations”.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nInflation and other adverse conditions may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results can be sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, inflation, economic slowdowns, stagflation and recessions. Our sales are subject to market conditions that may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile and unpredictable, particularly in our Electrical Solutions segment. Product demand can be affected by fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions, as well as currency fluctuations, commodity costs, and a variety of other factors.\nWe have recently experienced significant inflationary pressure across much of our business. Global supply chain issues and increased demand have led to increased freight, labor and commodity costs. In addition, various factors, including the level of economic activity in China, the war between Ukraine and Russia and the war between Israel and Hamas, have added to the volatility in energy costs. We have had to take various pricing actions to cover the higher costs and protect our margin profile. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our margins in response to further changes in inflationary pressures.\nIn addition, macroeconomic effects such as increases in interest rates and other measures taken by central banks and other policy makers could have a negative effect on overall economic activity that could reduce our customers’ demand for our products. Adverse changes in demand could impact our business, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in markets that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect selling prices or demand for our products.\nWe compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price. Competitors' behavior related to these, among other areas, could potentially have significant impacts on our financial results. Our competitive strategy is to design and manufacture high quality products at the lowest possible cost. Our strategy is to also increase selling prices to offset rising costs of raw materials and components. Competitive pricing pressures may not allow us to offset some or all of our increased costs through pricing actions. Alternatively, if raw material and component costs decline, the Company may not be able to maintain current pricing levels. We may face increased competition due to the rapid development and rising use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning\ntechnologies. Failure to adopt and incorporate such technologies to improve productivity, manufacturing technology or support functional teams may put us at a long-term competitive disadvantage. Competition could also affect future selling prices or demand for our products which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nVolatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international operations accounted for approximatel\ny 8%\nof our Net sales in 2023. We are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on translating the financial statements of our international operations, most of which are denominated in local currencies, into the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our international  operations. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect\nthe prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products, along with other local costs incurred in foreign countries for foreign entities with U.S. dollar functional currency. As a result, fluctuating exchange rates may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nOur ability to effectively develop and introduce new products could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nNew product introductions and the enhancement of existing products and services are key to the Company’s competitive strategy. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, timely and successful development of new products, including software development, market acceptance of these products and the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with these introductions. These risks include development and production capabilities, management of inventory levels to support anticipated demand, the risk that new products may have quality defects in the early stages of introduction, and obsolescence risk of existing products. The Company cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impact new product introductions could have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe manufacture and source products and materials from various countries throughout the world. A disruption in the availability, price or quality of these products or materials could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with global manufacturing and sourcing. We use a variety of raw materials in the production of our products including steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, zinc, nickel, plastics, phenolics, elastomers and petrochemicals. We also purchase certain electrical and electronic components, including solenoids, lighting ballasts, printed circuit boards, integrated circuit chips and cord sets from a number of suppliers. Significant shortages in the availability of these materials or significant price increases could increase our operating costs\nand adversely impact the competitive positions of our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations. See also Risk Factor, “\nSignificant developments from the recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us\n.\n” We rely on materials, components and finished goods that are sourced from or manufactured in foreign countries including Mexico, China, and other international countries. Political instability in any country where we do business could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe rely on our suppliers to produce high quality materials, components and finished goods according to our specifications, including timely delivery. There is a risk that products may not meet our quality control procedure specifications which could adversely affect our ability to ship quality products to our customers on a timely basis and, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $3,729 million. As required by generally accepted\naccounting\nprinciples, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments both within and outside the Company’s control. Deteriorating economic conditions, technological changes, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, intensified competition, divestitures, market capitalization declines and other factors may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods an impairment is recognized.\nWe engage in acquisitions and strategic investments and may encounter difficulty in obtaining appropriate acquisitions and in integrating these businesses.\nPart of the Company’s growth strategy involves acquisitions. We have pursued and will continue to seek acquisitions and other strategic investments to complement and expand our existing businesses. The rate and extent to which acquisitions become available may affect our growth rate. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these businesses into our operations and realize the planned synergies. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions into our operations and in managing strategic investments and foreign acquisitions and joint ventures may also present additional risk related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages. Failure to effectively complete or manage acquisitions may adversely affect our existing businesses as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Systems Control Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe full benefits of the Systems Control Acquisition, including the anticipated sales or growth opportunities, may not be realized as expected or may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Systems Control Acquisition could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows and decrease or delay the expected accretive effects of the Systems Control Acquisition.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement initiatives, including our restructuring activities that improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs.\nAchieving our long-term profitability goals depends significantly on our ability to control or reduce our operating costs. Because many of our costs are affected by factors completely, or substantially outside our control, we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through productivity initiatives. If we are not able to identify and implement initiatives that control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date do not generate expected cost savings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our efforts to control or reduce costs may include restructuring activities involving workforce reductions, facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits may be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks surrounding our information technology systems failures, network disruptions, breaches in data security and compliance with data privacy laws or regulations.\nWe are highly dependent on various software and information technology systems to record and process operational, human resources and financial transactions. The proper functioning of Hubbell’s information technology systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. Our information technology systems are susceptible to cyber threats, malware, phishing attacks, break-ins and similar events, breaches of physical security or tampering and manipulation of these systems by employees or unauthorized third parties. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as smartphones and laptops, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. Hubbell may also be subject to disruptions of any of our systems and our vendor's systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as natural disasters, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, and electrical/telecommunications outages or failures\n.\nAll of these risks are also applicable where Hubbell relies on outside vendors to provide services, which may operate in an online, or “cloud,” environment. A failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventory, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses; all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information that may result in financial or reputational damage to the Company, as well as expose the Company to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nHubbell also provides customers with solutions that include software components that allow for the control and/or the communication of data from those solutions to Hubbell or customer systems. In addition to the risks noted above, there are other risks associated with these solutions. For example, control and/or data from these solutions may be integral to a customer's operations. A failure of our technology to operate as designed or as a result of cyber threats could impact those operations, including by loss or destruction of data. Likewise, a customer’s failure to properly configure its own network are outside of the Company’s control and could result in a failure in functionality or security of our technology.\nHubbell is also subject to an increasing number of evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations that impose requirements on the Company and our technology prior to certain use or transfer, storing, processing, disclosure, and protection of data and prior to sale or use of certain technologies. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other costs. For example, the European Union’s implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation in 2018, the European Union’s pending ePrivacy Regulation and the implementation of the ePrivacy Directive by the various European Union member states, and California’s implementation of its Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and Connected Device Privacy Act of 2018, as well as data privacy statutes implemented by other states, could all disrupt our ability to sell products and solutions or use and transfer data because such activities may not be in compliance with applicable law in certain jurisdictions.\nWe have continued to work on improving our utilization of our enterprise resource planning system, expanding standardization of business processes and performing implementations at our remaining businesses, as well as acquired businesses, for example, the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system in 2024 at Aclara. We expect to incur additional costs related to future implementations, process reengineering efforts as well as enhancements and upgrades to the system. These system modifications and implementations could result in operating inefficiencies which could adversely impact our operating results and/or our ability to perform necessary business transactions.\nSystem failures, ineffective system implementation or disruptions, failure to comply with data privacy and security laws or regulations, IT system risk arising from the Company's acquisition activity or the compromise of security with respect to internal or external systems or portable electronic devices could damage the Company’s systems or infrastructure, subject us to liability claims, or regulatory fines, penalties, or intervention, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, disrupt customer operations, and adversely affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur ability to access capital markets or failure to maintain our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to invest in our business and make strategic acquisitions may require access to the capital markets. If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact our ability to access capital. Failure to maintain our credit ratings could also impact our ability to access credit markets and could increase our cost of borrowing. The capital and credit markets could deteriorate and market conditions could make it more difficult for us to access capital to finance our investments and acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDeterioration in the credit quality of, loss of, significant decline in business with, or pricing pressure from, our customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have an extensive customer base of distributors, wholesalers, electric utilities, OEMs, electrical contractors, telecommunications companies and retail and hardware outlets. We are not dependent on a single customer, however, our top ten customers account for approximately 42% of our Net sales. Deterioration in the credit quality of, loss of, significant decline in business with, or pricing pressure from, one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness; our indebtedness has increased as a result of the System Control Acquisition and will continue to increase if we incur additional indebtedness in the future and do not retire existing indebtedness.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. The amount of cash required to pay interest on our indebtedness following completion of the Systems Control Acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, is greater than the amount of cash required to service our indebtedness prior to the Systems Acquisition. Our increased indebtedness level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including (i) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, (ii) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and (iii) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.\nWe may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future. If we add new indebtedness and do not retire existing indebtedness, the risks described above could increase.\nIf the underlying investments of our defined benefit plans do not perform as expected, we may have to make additional contributions to these plans.\nWe sponsor certain pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact these plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, investment losses on plan assets and reductions in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets will be sufficient to meet future funding requirements.\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.\nGovernment agencies and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” for which the OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan that have been adopted and expanded by many taxing authorities to address perceived tax abuse and inconsistencies between tax jurisdictions. As a result, the tax laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nBecause tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and uncertainty, tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the Company.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The determination of the Company's worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires judgment and is based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in the various jurisdictions where the company operates. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in the Company's financial statements and may adversely affect the Company's financial results for the period when such determination is made.  We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provisions. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the future outcomes of these audits could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSignificant developments from the recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn prior years, the U.S. government has announced and, in some cases, implemented a new approach to trade policy, including renegotiating, or potentially terminating, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), which was replaced by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on July 1, 2020, and proposed trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (\"TPP\"), from which the United States has formally withdrawn, as well as implementing the imposition of additional tariffs on certain foreign goods, including finished products and raw materials such as steel and aluminum. Changes in the U.S. trade policy, U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot predict what changes to trade policy will be made by the current or a future presidential administration or Congress, including whether existing tariff policies will be maintained or modified or whether the entry into new bilateral or multilateral trade agreements will occur, nor can we predict the effects that any conceivable changes would have on our business.\nWe rely on materials, components and finished goods\n,\nsuch as steel and aluminum, that are sourced from or manufactured in foreign countries\n,\nincluding China and Mexico. Import tariffs and potential import tariffs have resulted or may result in increased prices for these imported goods and materials and, in some cases\n,\nmay result or have resulted in price increases for domestically sourced goods and materials. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted and could result in additional reactions from U.S. trading partners, including adopting responsive trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products or import goods and materials from those countries. These measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the U.S. or may cause us to adjust our worldwide supply chain. Either of these could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.\nIn recent years, various countries, and regions, including, without limitation, China, Mexico, Canada and Europe, have announced plans or intentions to impose or have imposed tariffs on a wide range of U.S. products in retaliation for new U.S. tariffs. These actions could, in turn, result in additional tariffs being adopted by the U.S. These conditions and future actions could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States increase the price of, or limit the amount of, raw materials and finished goods imported into the United States, the costs of our raw materials may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impacts on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations may be materially adversely effected by compliance with import and export laws.\nWe must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the import and export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. Moreover, any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. Any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe could incur significant and/or unexpected costs in our efforts to successfully avoid, manage, defend and litigate intellectual property matters.\nThe Company relies on certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property of which the Company cannot be certain that others have not and will not infringe upon. Intellectual property litigation could be costly and time consuming and the Company could incur significant legal expenses pursuing these claims against others.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement. Any dispute or litigation involving intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims, the Company may lose its rights to utilize critical technology or may be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at a substantial cost, any of which could negatively impact our operating results. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement, we may incur significant costs that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of our legal proceedings.\nWe are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that may adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability, intellectual property and environmental matters, which could be significant. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit. In the future, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, which insurance may not provide adequate coverage against such claims. We establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make additional payments, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for clean up or other costs or damages under environmental laws. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to climate change concerns. Environmental laws and regulations have generally become stricter in recent years. Compliance with any future laws and regulations could result in a materially adverse effect on our business and financial results. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of our legal proceedings.\nOur reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nWe cannot provide absolute assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents. Any such improper actions could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigation in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigative fees.\nRegulations related to conflict-free minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and may create challenges with our customers.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (“DRC”). The SEC has established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use “conflict” minerals sourced from the DRC in their products. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers who can provide conflict-free minerals and as a result, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain these conflict-free minerals at competitive prices. Compliance with these requirements may also increase our costs. In addition, we may face challenges with our customers if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe face the potential harms of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations.\nNatural disasters, the economic uncertainty resulting from the spread of global pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, and the actions taken by the United States and other governments in response to such events have in the past, and could in the future cause damage to or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create political or economic instability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, increases in energy demand and supply disruptions caused by the conflict in Ukraine have resulted in significantly higher energy prices, particularly in Europe. Additionally, the war between Israel and Hamas has added to the volatility in energy costs. Persistent high energy prices and the potential for further supply disruptions, may have an adverse impact on our business.  Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, or disrupt our supply chain.\nGlobal economic uncertainty could adversely affect us.\nDuring periods of prolonged slow growth, or a downturn in conditions in the worldwide or domestic economies, we could experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers. Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience, or the loss of key employees, could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategy."

    "text": "Risk Management and Strategy\nHubbell recognizes the importance of maintaining cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. Cybersecurity related risks are included in the risk universe that our enterprise risk management program evaluates to assess top risks to the enterprise on an annual basis. To the extent the enterprise risk management process identifies a heightened cybersecurity-related risk, risk owners are assigned to develop mitigation plans, which are then tracked to completion. Cybersecurity related risks are also considered as part of our business continuity and resiliency planning. Business continuity plans establish risk management processes and procedures to mitigate interruptions to business activities, including from cybersecurity incidents.\nGiven the complexity and evolving nature of the cybersecurity threat landscape, Hubbell has a dedicated team of internal and external cybersecurity professionals led by Hubbell’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) that regularly monitor alerts and meet to discuss threat levels, trends, and remediation. We engage a range of external experts, including cybersecurity assessors, consultants, and auditors in evaluating and testing our cybersecurity program. The engagement of third parties includes regular audits, threat assessments, and information system penetration tests. We also actively engage with key vendors, industry participants, legal counsel, and intelligence and law enforcement communities as part of our continuing efforts to evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of our cybersecurity policies and procedures. Hubbell further recognizes risks associated with the use of third-party service providers and has processes to identify material risks related to third parties. We conduct security assessments of third-party providers prior to their engagement and perform ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. Our monitoring includes periodic assessments by the CISO and a team of cybersecurity professionals. Our cybersecurity risk management program is aligned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework (NIST CSF).\nWe have not encountered any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. Notwithstanding the extensive approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. See Item IA. Risk Factors for potential risks related to our information technology systems that we are subject to and that may materially adversely affect our business (“We are subject to risks surrounding our information technology systems failures, network disruptions, breaches in data security and compliance with data privacy laws or regulations.”).\nGovernance\nHubbell’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) recognizes the critical nature of managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee of the Board has been delegated oversight of risks associated with cybersecurity threats and has developed mechanisms to ensure effective oversight in managing such cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee is composed of Board members with diverse expertise, including cybersecurity and technology, financial, and risk management experience.\nHubbell’s cybersecurity program is managed by a dedicated CISO who has over a decade of information technology and program management experience. The CISO is responsible for leading our enterprise-wide cybersecurity program and assessing, monitoring, and managing our cybersecurity risks. These responsibilities include overseeing cybersecurity governance programs, testing our compliance with standards, remediating known risks, completing cybersecurity risk management activities related to acquisition due diligence and integration, and leading our employee cybersecurity training program. The CISO stays current with the latest developments in cybersecurity and the evolving threat landscape to inform cybersecurity prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts. The CISO implements and oversees processes for the regular monitoring of our information systems. This includes processes to identify potential vulnerabilities. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the CISO is equipped with a detailed incident response plan which outlines the steps to be followed from incident detection to mitigation, notifications, and recovery. Notifications include functional areas (including legal), senior management and the Board, as applicable. We have adopted and enforce various enterprise-wide policies relating to cybersecurity, to ensure the ongoing protection of our systems including, policies to identify, classify, and protect company data, manage vulnerabilities, and perform user access reviews. We further conduct drills of our incident response plan to prepare\nincident response teams and provide cybersecurity training and phishing simulations throughout the year via our enterprise learning management systems.\nThe CISO provides regular (but not less than quarterly) updates to the Audit Committee. These updates include a broad range of topics, including the current cybersecurity and emerging threat landscape, the status of ongoing cybersecurity initiatives and strategies, incident reports, and the results of internal and external assessments of our information systems. The CISO, in his capacity, regularly informs our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; EVP, Chief Financial Officer; and SVP, General Counsel and Secretary on aspects related to cybersecurity risks and incidents. This ensures that the highest levels of management, including the Company’s Disclosure Committee, are made aware of Hubbell’s cybersecurity posture and potential cybersecurity risks. Furthermore, any material cybersecurity matters, and strategic cybersecurity risk management matters are promptly escalated to the Audit Committee of the Board."

    "text": "The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form-10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2023.\nExecutive Overview of the Business\nHubbell is a global manufacturer of quality electrical products and utility solutions for a broad range of customer and end market applications. We provide utility and electrical solutions that enable our customers to operate critical infrastructure reliably and efficiently, and we empower and energize communities through innovative solutions supporting energy infrastructure In Front of the Meter, on The Edge, and Behind the Meter. In Front of the Meter is where utilities transmit and distribute energy to their customers. The Edge connects utilities with owner/operators and allows energy and data to be distributed back and forth. Behind the Meter is where owners and operators of buildings, industrial facilities and other critical infrastructure consume energy. Products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico, China, the UK, Brazil, Australia, Spain, Ireland, and the Republic of the Philippines. The Company also participates in joint ventures in Hong Kong and the Republic of the Philippines, and maintains offices in Singapore, Italy, China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Chile, and countries in the Middle East. The Company employed approximately 18,300 individuals worldwide as of December 31, 2023.\nOur reporting segments consist of the Utility Solutions segment, that has a leading position in Front of the Meter and at The Edge and the Electrical Solutions segment that is positioned Behind the Meter. Our long-term strategy is to: Serve our customers with reliable and innovative electrical and related infrastructure solutions with desired brands and high-quality service, delivered through a competitive cost structure; complement organic revenue growth with acquisitions that enhance our product offerings; and allocate capital effectively to create shareholder value.\nOur strategy to complement organic revenue growth with acquisitions is focused on acquiring assets that extend our capabilities, expand our product offerings, and present opportunities to compete in core, adjacent or complementary markets. Our acquisition strategy also provides the opportunity to advance our revenue growth objectives during periods of weakness or inconsistency in our end-markets. Pursuant to that strategy, we made three acquisitions in 2023 for an aggregate purchase price, net of cash, of approximately $1.2 billion, including our mid-December acquisition of Northern Star Holdings, Inc. (commercially known as Systems Control) for approximately $1.1 billion, net of cash. For additional information regarding our acquisition, see Note 4 - Business Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, which note is incorporated herein by reference.\nOur strategy to deliver products through a competitive cost structure has resulted in past and ongoing restructuring and related activities. Our restructuring and related efforts include the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities, and workforce actions, as well as streamlining and consolidating our back-office functions. The primary objectives of our restructuring and related activities are to optimize our manufacturing footprint, cost structure and effectiveness, as well as the efficiency of our workforce.\nProductivity improvement also continues to be a key area of focus for the Company and efforts to drive productivity complement our restructuring and related activities to minimize the impact of rising material costs and other administrative cost inflation. Because material costs are approximately two thirds of our cost of goods sold, volatility in this area can significantly impact profitability. Our goal is to have pricing and productivity programs that offset material and other inflationary cost increases as well as pay for investments in key growth areas.\nProductivity programs affect virtually all functional areas within the Company by reducing or eliminating waste and improving processes. We continue to expand our efforts related to global product and component sourcing and supplier cost reduction programs. Value engineering efforts, product transfers and the use of lean process improvement techniques are expected to continue to increase manufacturing efficiency. In addition, we continue to build upon the benefits of our enterprise resource planning system across all functions.\nOur sales are also subject to market conditions that may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile and unpredictable, particularly in our Electrical Solutions segment. Product demand can be affected by fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions, as well as currency fluctuations, commodity costs, and a variety of other factors. Since early 2021, we have experienced significant inflationary pressure across much of our business. As a result, we have taken various pricing actions to cover the higher costs and to protect our profitability. Although there has been some mitigation in the rate of inflation in recent months, we expect inflation to remain a factor for the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to take these pricing actions subject to demand and market conditions. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our margins in response to further changes in inflationary pressures. In addition, macroeconomic effects such as increases in interest rates and other measures taken by central banks and other policy makers could have a negative effect on overall economic activity which could reduce our customers’ demand for our products.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the Commercial and Industrial Lighting business (the \"C&I Lighting business\") to GE Current, a Daintree Company. The disposal of the C&I Lighting business met the criteria set forth in ASC 205-20 to be presented as a discontinued operation. The C&I Lighting businesses' results of operations and the related cash flows have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and cash flows from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, respectively, for all periods presented. For additional information regarding this transaction and its effect on our financial reporting, see Note 2 – Discontinued Operations, in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, which note is incorporated herein by reference.\nResults of Operations\nOur operations are classified into two reportable segments: Utility Solutions and Electrical Solutions. For a complete description of the Company’s segments, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within these segments, Hubbell serves customers in five primary end markets: utility T&D components, utility communications and controls, non-residential, residential, and industrial. Unless specified otherwise, all comparisons of 2023 results are with 2022 results.\nIn 2023, Net sales increased by 8.6% or\n$425 million\nand organic Net sales\n(1)\nincreased by 6.6% or\n$325 million\non favorable price realization partially offset by modestly lower volumes, as further discussed in segment results below. Operating margin increased in 2023, by 500 basis points and adjusted operating margin\n(1)\nalso increased by 510 basis points, driven by favorable price realization, improved operational productivity and lower material costs. Those increases were partially offset by continued non-material cost inflation, increased investments in capacity, innovation and productivity and lower unit volumes. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Hubbell increased by 48.6% in 2023 compared to the prior year and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 49.0%.\nAdjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Hubbell\n(1)\nincreased by 44.1% in 2023 compared to the prior year and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations\n(1)\nincreased by 44.4% in 2023.\nOperating cash flow was higher in 2023 at $880.8 million as compared to $636.2 million in prior year. Free cash flow\n(2)\nwas higher in 2023 at $715.1 million as compared to $506.9 million in the prior year. In 2023 we paid $245.5 million in shareholder dividends, an increase of 6.9% as compared to the prior year. We also invested $165.7 million in capacity for our customers as well as in innovation and productivity initiatives, and repurchased $30.0 million of shares in 2023.\n(1) Organic Net sales, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Hubbell and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are non-GAAP financial measures. See \"Adjusted Operating Measures\" below for a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measures.\n(2) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Adjusted Operating Measures\" and \"Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flow\" below for a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure.\nSUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nAdjusted Operating Measures\nIn the following discussion of results of operations, we refer to \"adjusted\" operating measures. We believe those adjusted measures, which exclude the impact of certain costs, gains and losses, may provide investors with useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period and allow investors to understand our results of operations without regard to items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the comparability of operating results, or we do not consider a component of our core operating performance.\nSignificant items impacting comparability:\nTransaction, integration and separation costs\nThe effects that acquisitions and divestitures may have on our results fluctuate significantly based on the timing, size and number of transactions, and therefore result in significant volatility in the costs to complete transactions and integrate or separate the businesses.\nThe size of acquisition and divestiture actions taken by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2023 has resulted in a significant increase in these costs. As a result, we believe excluding costs relating to these fourth quarter transactions provides useful and more comparable information to investors to better assess our operating performance.\nTransaction costs are primarily professional services and other fees incurred to complete the transactions. Integration and separation costs are the internal and external incremental costs directly relating to these activities for the acquired or divested business.\nPension charge\nIn 2022, we incurred pension settlement charges of $7.0 million that did not repeat in 2023.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAdjusted operating measures also exclude non-cash amortization of all intangible assets associated with our business acquisitions, including inventory step-up amortization associated with those acquisitions. The intangible assets associated with our business acquisitions arise from the allocation of the purchase price using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations.” These assets consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technology, trademarks and tradenames, and patents, as reported in Note 7 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, under the heading “Total Definite-Lived Intangibles\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company believes that the exclusion of these non-cash expenses (i) enhances management’s and investors’ ability to analyze underlying business performance, (ii) facilitates comparisons of our financial results over multiple periods, and (iii) provides more relevant comparisons of our results with the results of other companies as the amortization expense associated with these assets may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing, size, nature, and number of acquisitions. Although we exclude amortization of these acquired intangible assets and inventory step-up from our non-GAAP results, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that revenue generated, in part, from such intangibles is included within revenue in determining adjusted net income from continuing operations.\nAdjusted results also excluded the income tax effects of the above adjustments which are calculated using the statutory tax rate, taking into consideration the nature of the item and the relevant taxing jurisdiction, unless otherwise noted.\nThe Company excludes these non-core items because we believe it enhances management's and investors' ability to analyze underlying business performance and facilitates comparisons of our financial results over multiple periods. Refer to the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures presented below, Note 4 – Business Acquisitions and Dispositions, and Note 12 – Retirement Benefits, for additional information.\nOrganic Net sales, a non-GAAP measure, represents Net sales according to U.S. GAAP, less Net sales from acquisitions and divestitures during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture, respectively, less the effect of fluctuations in Net sales from foreign currency exchange. The period-over-period effect of fluctuations in Net sales from foreign currency exchange is calculated as the difference between local currency Net sales of the prior period translated at the current period exchange rate as compared to the same local currency Net sales translated at the prior period exchange rate. We believe this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency as these activities can obscure underlying trends. When comparing Net sales growth between periods excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates, those effects are different when comparing results for different periods. For example, because Net sales from acquisitions are considered inorganic from the date we complete an acquisition through the end of the first year following the acquisition, Net sales from such acquisition are reflected as organic Net sales thereafter.\nThere are limitations to the use of non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures do not present complete financial results. We compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or alternative measures of, reported GAAP financial results, and should be viewed in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures and the provided reconciliations thereto. We believe, however, that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed together with our GAAP results and related reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted operating income, a non-GAAP measure, to Operating income, the directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions):\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Hubbell Incorporated, Adjusted net income from continuing operations available to common shareholders, and the diluted per share amounts thereof, each a non-GAAP measure, to the directly comparable GAAP financial measures (in millions, except per share data).\n(1)\nThe income tax effects are calculated using the statutory tax rate, taking into consideration the nature of the item and the relevant taxing jurisdiction, unless otherwise noted.\nThe following table reconciles our Organic Net sales growth to the directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions and percentage change):\n2023 Compared to 2022\nNet Sales\nNet sales of $5,372.9 million in 2023 increased by $425.0 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2022. Organic net sales increased by 6.6%, which was composed of a high single digit percentage increase in price realization, partially offset by a low single digit percentage decrease in volumes. Net sales also increased by 1.9% from acquisitions and by 0.1% from foreign exchange.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit\nAs a percentage of Net sales, cost of goods sold decreased by 540 basis points to 64.9% in 2023 as compared to 70.3% in 2022, resulting in a related 540 basis point increase in Gross profit margin in 2023, which increased to 35.1% as compared to 29.7% in 2022. The increase in the Gross profit margin primarily reflects approximately nine percentage points of margin expansion driven by favorable price realization, improved operational productivity and lower material costs. Operational productivity was driven by improving supply chain conditions and reduced rates of absenteeism as compared to the prior year. Those increases were offset by approximately four percentage points of margin headwind driven by continued non-material cost inflation, increased investment in capacity, innovation and productivity, as well as lower unit volumes.\nSelling & Administrative Expenses\nS&A expense in 2023 was $849.6 million and increased by $87.1 million compared to the prior year. S&A expense as a percentage of Net sales increased by 40 basis points to 15.8% in 2023. The increase in S&A expense as a percentage of Net sales is primarily due to the impact of higher personnel cost and other cost inflation that was partially offset by a benefit from the increase in Net sales.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal other expense increased by $3.1 million in 2023 to $55.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $13.3 million reduction of income related to the C&I Lighting business disposition in 2022 that did not recur in 2023 and higher non-service pension cost recognized in 2023 as compared to 2022. Those items were partially offset by a pension settlement charge of $7.0 million recorded in 2022 that did not recur in 2023 and lower net interest expense recorded in 2023 compared to 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate was 22.1% in 2023 as compared to 21.3% in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a favorable tax impact in 2022 from the completion of a tax audit and increased 2023 income in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by a higher stock based compensation tax benefit in 2023.\nNet Income From Continuing Operations Attributable to Hubbell and Earnings Per Diluted Share From Continuing Operations\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to Hubbell was $759.8 million in 2023 and increased 48.6% as compared to 2022\n. Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Hubbell was $829.4 million in 2023 and increased 44.1% as compared to 2022. The increase in net income from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations is primarily the result of higher operating income, driven by higher Net sales, and operation margin expansion, partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate, all as discussed above. As a result, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in 2023 increased 49.0% compared to 2022. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in 2023 increased 44.4% as compared to 2022.\nIncome From Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nThere was no income or loss from discontinued operations in 2023. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $34.6 million in 2022. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes pre-tax transaction and separation costs of $8.8 million.\nSegment Results\nUtility Solutions\nThe following table reconciles our Utility Solutions segment Organic Net sales growth to the directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions and percentage change):\nNet sales in the Utility Solutions segment in 2023 were approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of 13.6% as compared to 2022. This increase was due to a 11.7% increase in organic net sales driven by a high single digit percentage increase in price realization and a low single digit percentage increase in unit volumes. Acquisitions contributed 1.8% to Net sales growth in 2023 and foreign exchange contributed 0.1%. Volume increases were primarily driven by Communications and Controls due to improved availability of semiconductors, along with strength in utility transmission markets, partially offset by channel inventory management in distribution markets. Favorable price realization was driven by actions to offset inflation, as well as by our service levels.\nOperating income in the Utility Solutions segment in 2023 increased by 61.3% to $706.6 million as compared to 2022. Operating margin in 2023 increased to 21.7% as compared to 15.3% in 2022. Excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and transaction, integration & separation costs, adjusted operating margin in 2023 increased by 670 basis points to 23.9% as compared to the prior year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin and adjusted operating margin were primarily driven by approximately 10 percentage points of margin expansion from favorable price realization, improved operational productivity and lower material costs. That year-over-year margin expansion includes an increase of approximately 60 basis points from a commercial resolution with a customer in the fourth quarter of 2022 that did not repeat in 2023. Those increases were partially offset by three percentage points of margin headwind due to increases in non-material cost inflation and investments in capacity, innovation and productivity.\nElectrical Solutions\nThe following table reconciles our Organic Net sales growth to the directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions and percentage change):\nNet sales of the Electrical Solutions segment in 2023 were $2.1 billion, an increase of $34.4 million, or 1.7% as compared to 2022. Acquisitions contributed 2.1% to the increase, partially offset by a 0.5% decrease in organic net sales in 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a mid-single digit percentage decrease in unit volumes mostly offset by a mid-single digit percentage increase in price realization. Markets for the Electrical Solutions segment were mixed, with weakness in residential markets and channel inventory management in commercial markets driving the decline in unit volumes. Industrial end markets were solid and renewables and datacenter verticals were also notably strong in 2023. Favorable price realization was driven primarily by actions to recover inflationary costs.\nOperating income of the Electrical Solutions segment in 2023 was $331.9 million and increased approximately 22.5% compared to 2022, while operating margin in 2023 increased by 270 basis points as compared to the prior year to 15.7%. Excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and transaction, integration & separation costs, adjusted operating margin was 16.6% in 2023, which increased 250 basis points as compared to 2022. The increase in the operating margin and adjusted operating margin in 2023 was primarily due to approximately seven percentage points of margin expansion from favorable price realization, improved operational productivity and lower material and freight costs. Those increases were partially offset by approximately four percentage points of margin headwind driven by increases in non-material cost inflation, lower volumes and investments in capacity, innovation and productivity.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe current and prior period results presented below represent the results of our continuing operations and exclude the results of the C&I Lighting business which are presented within cash provided by discontinued operations. See Note 2 - Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nCash Flow\nThe following table reconciles our cash flows from operating activities to free cash flows for 2023 and 2022:\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information regarding Hubbell’s ability to generate cash without reliance on external financing. In addition, management uses free cash flow to evaluate the resources available for investments in the business, strategic acquisitions and further strengthening the balance sheet.\n2023 Compared to 2022\nCash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $880.8 million in 2023 compared to $636.2 million in 2022.  The increase was primarily due to higher net income in 2023 compared to 2022, partially offset by the timing of advance payments from customers, and an increase in employee and customer incentive payments in 2023.\nCash used in investing activities was $1,380.2 million in 2023 compared to cash provided of $18.1 million in 2022.  That change was driven by an increase in cash used for acquisitions of $1,034.6 million, net proceeds of $332.8 million in 2022 from the disposition of C&I Lighting business, and a $36.4 million increase in capital expenditures in 2023 for capital investments to expand capacity, optimize footprint, and implement automation and productivity initiatives.\nCash provided by financing activities was $388.5 million in 2023 as compared to cash used of $437.1 million in 2022. The change in cash flows from financing activities primarily reflects an increase in net borrowing of $702.6 million, primarily due to $600 million of indebtedness under the Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) and a $100 million increase in commercial paper borrowing in 2023 to finance the acquisition of Systems Control. The increase in cash provided also reflects lower share repurchases in 2023 compared to 2022.\nThe favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on cash was $6.9 million in 2023 as compared to an unfavorable effect of $8.8 million in 2022. The favorable impact in 2023 was primarily related to a stronger Mexican Peso, British Pound and Canadian Dollar compared to the U.S. Dollar.\nInvestments in the Business\nInvestments in our business include cash outlays for the acquisitions of businesses as well as expenditures to maintain the operation of our equipment and facilities and invest in restructuring activities.\nIn December 2023, the Company acquired Northern Star Holdings, Inc., (\"Systems Control\") for approximately $1.1 billion, net of cash acquired, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Systems Control is a manufacturer of substation control and relay panels, as well as turnkey substation control building solutions. This business is reported in the Utility Solutions segment and enhances Hubbell Utility Solutions' industry-leading franchise across utility components, communications and controls.\nIn October 2023, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Indústria Eletromecânica Balestro Ltda. (\"Balestro\") for a cash purchase price of approximately $88 million, net of cash acquired, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Balestro is a company headquartered in Mogi Mirim, São Paulo, Brazil, and is recognized for designing, manufacturing, and delivering top quality products for the electrical utility industry in Brazil and other countries in Latin America, as well as other parts of the world. This business is reported in the Utility Solutions segment.\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of El Electronics LLC (\"EIG\") for a cash purchase price of approximately $60 million, net of cash acquired, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. EIG offers fully integrated energy management and power quality monitoring solutions for the electric utility and commercial and industrial markets. This business is reported in the Utility Solutions segment.\nFor more information, refer to Note 4 - Business Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nDuring 2023, we invested $165.7 million in capital expenditures, an increase of $36.4 million as compared to 2022, as we increased capital investments to expand capacity, optimize footprint and implement automation and productivity initiatives.\nWe continue to invest in restructuring and related programs to maintain a competitive cost structure, to drive operational efficiencies and to mitigate the impact of rising material costs and administrative cost inflation. We expect our investment in restructuring and related activities to continue in 2024 as we continue to invest in previously initiated actions and initiate further footprint consolidation and other cost reduction initiatives.\nIn connection with our restructuring and related actions, we have incurred restructuring costs as defined by U.S. GAAP, which are primarily severance and employee benefits, asset impairments, and accelerated depreciation, as well as facility closure, contract termination and certain pension costs that are directly related to restructuring actions. We also incurred restructuring-related costs, which are costs associated with our business transformation initiatives, including the consolidation of back-office functions and streamlining of our processes, and certain other costs and gains associated with restructuring actions. We refer to these costs on a combined basis as \"restructuring and related costs\", which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period. Restructuring costs are predominantly settled in cash from our operating activities and are generally settled within one year, with the exception of asset impairments, which are non-cash.\nThe table below presents the restructuring and related costs incurred in 2023, additional expected costs, and the expected completion date of restructuring actions that had been initiated as of December 31, 2023 and in prior years (in millions):\nStock Repurchase Program\nWe currently have total authorization to repurchase up to $300 million of shares of our common stock. On October 21, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the \"October 2022 program\") that authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of common stock, which expires in October 2025. On October 23, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the \"October 2020 program\") that authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of common stock, which expired in October 2023. There have been no repurchases under the October 2022 program. At December 31, 2023, our remaining share repurchase authorization under the October 2022 program was $300 million. The Company repurchased $30.0 million and $182.0 million of shares of Common Stock in 2023 and 2022, respectively, under the October 2020 program. Subject to numerous factors, including market conditions and alternative uses of cash, we may conduct discretionary repurchases through open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may include repurchases under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nDebt to Capital\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $2,023.2 million and $1,437.9 million, respectively, of long-term debt outstanding, net of unamortized discount and the unamortized balance of capitalized debt issuance costs, with the increase resulting primarily from the financing, described below, for the Systems Control acquisition. At December 31, 2023 the Company had $15.0 million of maturities due within the next 12 months related to the Term Loan Agreement, which were classified within short term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no long-term debt with maturities due within the next 12 months.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nIn December 2023, the Company entered into a new Term Loan Agreement (the \"Term Loan Agreement\") with a syndicate of lenders under which the Company borrowed $600 million on an unsecured basis to partially finance the Systems Control Acquisition, which was completed on December 12, 2023. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest generally at either the adjusted term SOFR rate plus an applicable margin (determined by a ratings based grid) or the alternative base rate. Currently, the loans bear interest based on the adjusted term SOFR rate. The principal amount of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement amortize in equal quarterly installments of 2.5% in year one, 2.5% in year two, 5% in year three, with the remaining borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement due and payable in full at maturity in December 2026. The Company may make principal payments in excess of the amortization schedule at its discretion. The sole financial covenant in the Term Loan Agreement requires that total debt not exceed 65% of total capitalization as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company. The Company was in compliance with this covenant as of December 31, 2023.\nBorrowings under Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Company, as borrower, and its subsidiaries Hubbell Power Holdings S.à r.l. and Harvey Hubbell Holdings S.à r.l., each as a subsidiary borrower (collectively, the “Subsidiary Borrowers”) are parties to a five-year credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, that provides a $750 million committed revolving credit facility (the “2021 Credit Facility\"), which matures on March 12, 2026. Commitments under the 2021 Credit Facility may be increased to an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.25 billion. The 2021 Credit Facility includes a $50 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The sum of the dollar amount of loans and letters of credit to the Subsidiary Borrowers under the 2021 Credit Facility may not exceed $75 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nThe interest rate applicable to borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility is (i) either the alternate base rate (as defined in the 2021 Credit Facility) or (ii) the adjusted SOFR rate plus an applicable margin (determined by a ratings based grid).\nThe 2021 Credit Facility contains a sole financial covenant requiring that, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization shall not be greater than 65%. The Company was in compliance with this covenant as of December 31, 2023.\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nAt each of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had outstanding unsecured, senior notes in principal amounts of $400 million due in 2026, $300 million due in 2027, $450 million due in 2028 and $300 million due in 2031 (the \"Notes\"). In the first quarter of 2021, net proceeds from the senior notes due 2031 were used, along with cash on hand, to redeem in full all $300 million outstanding principal amount of the Company's outstanding senior notes due in 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\"). The redemption of the 2022 Notes resulted in a $16.8 million loss on extinguishment that was recognized in the second quarter of 2021.\nThe carrying value of the Notes, net of unamortized discount and the unamortized balance of capitalized debt issuance costs, was $1,440.3 million and $1,437.9 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe Notes are callable at any time at specified prices and are only subject to accelerated payment prior to maturity upon customary events of default, or upon a change in control triggering event as defined in the indenture governing the Notes, as supplemented. The Company was in compliance with all covenants (none of which is financial) as of December 31, 2023.\nShort-term Debt\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $117.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of short-term debt outstanding composed of:\n◦\nThere was $100.0 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023, which were used to partially fund the Systems Control Acquisition. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\n◦\n$15 million of long-term debt was classified as short-term within current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, reflecting maturities within the next 12 months relating to borrowing under the Term Loan Agreement at December 31, 2023.\n◦\nThe Company had $2.4 million and $4.7 million short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, which consisted of borrowings to support our international operations in China and amounts outstanding under our commercial card program.\nNet debt, defined as total debt less cash and investments, is a non-GAAP measure that may not be comparable to definitions used by other companies. We consider net debt to be a useful measure of our financial leverage for evaluating the Company’s ability to meet its funding needs.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of net debt at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nLiquidity\nWe measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operational funding needs, to fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and to make dividend payments to shareholders. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividend payments, stock repurchases, access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.\nIn 2023, we returned capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These activities were funded primarily with cash flows from operations.\n◦\nIn 2023, cash used for share repurchases was $30.0 million.\n◦\nDividends paid on our Common Stock in 2023 were $245.5 million.\nWe also require cash outlays to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements to accommodate anticipated levels of business activity, as well as our rate of cash dividends and potential future acquisitions. We have contractual obligations for long-term debt, operating leases, purchase obligations, and certain other long-term liabilities, including defined benefit retirement obligations and other benefits.  Refer to Note 13 - Debt and Note 24 - Leases in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on anticipated cash outflows.  As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), we also have an obligation to fund, by annual installments through 2025, the Company's liability for the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. Contractual purchase obligations are\napproximately $490 million i\nn 2024. Contractual purchase obligations beyond 2024 are not significant.\nOur purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity, delivery and termination liability. These obligations primarily consist of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements and commitments for equipment purchases. As of December 31, 2023, we have\n$47.0 million\nof uncertain tax positions reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of settlement of these uncertain tax positions and, as a result, they have been excluded from the disclosure. See Note 14 — Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur sources of funds and available resources to meet these funding needs are as follows:\n◦\nCash flows from operating activities and existing cash resources: In addition to our cash flows from operating activities, we also had $336.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023, of which approximately 16% was held inside the United States and the remainder held internationally.\n◦\nOur 2021 Credit Facility provides a $750.0 million committed revolving credit facility and commitments under the 2021 Credit Facility may be increased (subject to certain conditions) to an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.250 billion. Annual commitment fees to support availability under the 2021 Credit Facility are not material. Although not the principal source of liquidity, we believe our 2021 Credit Facility is capable of providing significant financing flexibility at reasonable rates of interest and is an attractive alternative source of funding in the event that commercial paper markets experience disruption. However, an increase in usage of the 2021 Credit Facility related to growth or a significant deterioration in the results of our operations or cash flows could cause our borrowing costs to increase and/or our ability to borrow could be restricted. We have not entered into any guarantees that could give rise to material unexpected cash requirements. The full $750.0 million of borrowing capacity under the 2021 Credit Facility was available to the Company at December 31, 2023.\n◦\nIn addition to our commercial paper program and existing revolving credit facility, we also have the ability to obtain additional financing through the issuance of long-term debt. Considering our current credit rating, historical earnings performance, and financial position, we believe that we would be able to obtain additional long-term debt financing on attractive terms.\n◦\nThe Company also maintains other lines of credit that are primarily used to support the issuance of letters of credit. Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, total availability under these lines was $55.9 million and $55.8 million, respectively, of which $23.4 million and $31.7 million was utilized to support letters of credit and the remaining amount was unused. The annual commitment fees associated with these lines of credit are not material.\nPension Funding Status\nWe have a number of funded and unfunded non-contributory U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans. Benefits under these plans are generally provided based on either years of service and final average pay or a specified dollar amount per year of service. The funded status of our qualified, defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including future returns on invested pension assets, the level of market interest rates, employee earnings and employee demographics.\nIn 2022, the Company recognized a settlement loss within continuing operations relating to retirees that elected to receive lump-sum distributions from the Company's defined benefit pension plans of $7.0 million. This charge was the result of lump-sum payments which exceeded the threshold for settlement accounting under U.S. GAAP in such year\n.\nChanges in the value of the defined benefit plan assets and liabilities will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Although differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are no longer deferred for balance sheet purposes, deferral is still permitted for pension expense purposes. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of an annual calculated minimum amount (the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or 10% of the market value of assets) have been amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost. Effective January 1, 2020, the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses of all of the Company's qualified defined benefit pension plans is recognized over the remaining life expectancy of participants, as all participants are considered inactive as a result of plan amendments. During 2023 and 2022, we recorded $10.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, of pension expense related to the amortization of these unrecognized losses.\nIn 2023 and 2022, we contributed $20.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively, to our qualified foreign and domestic defined benefit pension plans. These contributions have improved the funded status of those plans. Although not required by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, the Company may elect to make a voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan in 2024. The anticipated level of pension funding in 2024 is not expected to have a significant impact on our overall liquidity.\nAssumptions\nThe following assumptions were used to determine projected pension and other benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit costs for the year:\nAt the end of each year, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets based on the strategic asset allocation for our plans. In making this determination, we utilize expected rates of return for each asset class based upon current market conditions and expected risk premiums for each asset cla\nss. A one percentage point change in the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets would have an impact of approximately $4.4 million on 2024 pretax pension expense\n. The expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair market value of pension fund assets to produce the expected return on fund assets that is included in pension expense.\nThe difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets was recognized at December 31, 2023 for balance sheet purposes, but continues to be deferred for expense purposes. The net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense through the amortization of gains (losses) with an offsetting adjustment to Hubbell shareholders’ equity through Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nAt the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities. For our U.S. and Canadian pension plans, this discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows associated with our benefit obligations to the expected cash flows of a hypothetical portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that closely match the expected funding period of our pension liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, we used a discount rate of\n5.20%\nfor our U.S. pension plans compared to a discount rate of 5.50% used in 2022. For our Canadian pension plan, we used a discount rate of 4.61% in 2023, compared to a 5.01% discount rate used in 2022.\nFor our UK pension plan the discount rate was derived using a full yield curve and uses plan specific cash flows. The derived discount rate is the single discount rate equivalent to discounting these liability cash flows at the term-dependent spot rates of AA corporate bonds. This methodology resulted in a December 31, 2023 discount rate for the UK pension plan of 4.80% as compared to a discount rate of 5.00% used in 2022.\nA decrease of one percentage point in the discount rate would increase our 2024 pretax pension expense by approximately $0.2 million. A discount rate increase of one percentage point would decrease our 2024 pretax pension expense by $0.4 million.\nIn 2022 and 2023 we used the Pri-2012 mortality table and adopted the MP-2021 projection scale to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities. The Pri-2012 mortality table with adjustment for collar as appropriate and generational projection from 2012 using Scale MP-2021 was chosen as the best estimate based on the observed and anticipated experience of the plans after considering alternative tables.\nOther Post-Employment Benefits (“OPEB”)\nThe Company also has a number of health care and life insurance benefit plans covering eligible employees who reached retirement age while working for the Company. These benefits have been discontinued for substantially all future retirees. These plans are not funded and, therefore, no assumed rate of return on assets is required. We use a similar methodology to derive the discount rate for our post employment benefit plan obligations that we use for our pension plans. As of December 31, 2023, the Company used a discount rate of 5.20% to determine the projected benefit obligation compared to a discount rate of 5.50%  used in 2022.\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance for retirement benefits, we recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss, within Hubbell shareholders’ equity, a benefit, net of tax, of $4.7 million in 2023 and $5.5 million in 2022, respectively, related to the annual remeasurement of the OPEB plans and the amortization of prior service credits and net actuarial gains.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements are defined as any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity that is not included in our consolidated results is a party, under which we, whether or not a party to the arrangement, have, or in the future may have: (1) an obligation under a direct or indirect guarantee or similar arrangement, (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets, (3) an obligation or liability, including a contingent obligation or liability, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except that it is excluded from the scope of FASB ASC Topic 815, or (4)  an obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material to, the Company, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with, the Company.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined above which have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNote 1 — Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe are required to make assumptions and estimates and apply judgments in the preparation of our financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors deemed relevant by management, such as projections of future performance. We continually review these estimates and their underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. Changes in estimates and assumptions used by us could have a material impact on our financial results, and actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe that the following estimates are among the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are based on our judgment.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied, which generally occurs, for products, upon the transfer of control in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the sale. The majority of the Company’s revenue associated with products is recognized at a point in time when the product is shipped to the customer, with a relatively small amount of transactions in the Utility Solutions segment recognized upon delivery of the product at the contractually specified destination.\nThe Company also has performance obligations, primarily within the Utility Solutions segment, that are recognized over time due to the customized nature of the product and the Company's enforceable right to receive payment for work performed to date in the event of a cancellation. The Company uses an input measure to determine the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, which the Company believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under this method, revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.\nRevenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is approximately two percent of total annual consolidated net revenue and those service contracts and post-shipment obligations are primarily within the Utility Solutions segment. Revenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is recognized when or as those obligations are satisfied. The Company primarily offers assurance-type standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations and on occasion will separately offer and price extended warranties that are separate performance obligations for which the associated revenue is recognized over-time based on the extended warranty period. The Company records amounts billed to customers for reimbursement of shipping and handling costs within revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of goods sold. Sales taxes and other usage-based taxes are excluded from revenue.\nWithin the Electrical Solutions segment, certain businesses require a portion of the transaction price to be paid in advance of transfer of control. Advance payments are not considered a significant financing component as they are received less than one year before the related performance obligations are satisfied. In addition, in the Utility Solutions segment, certain businesses offer annual maintenance service contracts that require payment at the beginning of the contract period. These payments are treated as a contract liability and are classified in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Once control transfers to the customer and the Company meets the revenue recognition criteria, the deferred revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The deferred revenue relating to the annual maintenance service contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight line basis over the expected term of the contract.\nThe Company has certain arrangements that require us to estimate at the time of sale the amounts of variable consideration that should not be recorded as revenue as certain amounts are not expected to be collected from customers, as well as an estimate of the value of the product to be returned. The Company principally relies on historical experience, specific customer agreements and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of shipment and to reduce the transaction price. These arrangements include sales discounts and allowances based on sales volumes, specific programs and special pricing allowances, and returned goods, as are customary in the electrical products industry. Customer returns have historically been approximately one percent of gross sales.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Approximately 45% of total net inventory value is determined utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory accounting. The cost of foreign inventories and certain domestic inventories is determined utilizing average cost or first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods of inventory accounting.\nWe routinely evaluate the carrying value of our inventories to ensure they are carried at the lower of LIFO or FIFO cost or market value. Such evaluation is based on our judgment and use of estimates, including sales forecasts, gross margins for particular product groupings, planned dispositions of product lines, technological events and overall industry trends. In addition, the evaluation is based on changes in inventory management practices which may influence the timing of exiting products and method of\ndisposing of excess inventory.\nExcess inventory is generally identified by comparing future expected inventory usage to actual on-hand quantities. Inventory values are reduced for on-hand inventory in excess of pre-defined usage forecasts. Forecast usage is primarily determined by projecting historical (actual) sales and inventory usage levels forward to future periods. Changes in these estimates may necessitate future adjustments to inventory values.\nEmployee Benefits Costs and Funding\nWe sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension, defined contribution and other postretirement plans. Significant assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on the pension fund assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels and health care cost increase projections. These assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement dates. Further discussion o\nf the assumptions used in 2023 and 2022 are included above under “Pension Funding Status” and in Note 12 — Retirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTaxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Additionally, deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets are the forecast of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets, and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income can affect the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets.\nWe operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities routinely review our tax returns. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. The Company records uncertain tax positions when it has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Company uses the criteria established in the accounting guidance to determine whether an item meets the definition of more-likely-than-not. The Company’s policy is to recognize these uncertain tax positions when the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, when the statute of limitations has expired or upon settlement. In management’s opinion, adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from any examinations. See\nNote 14 — Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nOur long-lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, molds and dies, software, goodwill and other intangible assets. Long-lived assets, other than land, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents purchase price in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets primarily consist of patents, tradenames, developed technology and customer related intangibles.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessment. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing as of April 1\nst\nof each year. The accounting guidance provides entities an option of performing a qualitative assessment (the \"Step-zero\" test) before performing a quantitative analysis. If the entity determines, on the basis of certain qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill is not impaired, the entity would not need to proceed to the quantitative goodwill impairment testing process as prescribed in the guidance. If the Company does not elect to complete the qualitative assessment, the Company completes the quantitative assessment whereby the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2023. For each of the Company's four reporting units, the Company elected to utilize the quantitative goodwill impairment testing process, as permitted in the accounting guidance, by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. As of April 1, 2023, the impairment testing resulted in implied fair values for each reporting unit that exceeded such reporting unit’s carrying value, by at least 47%, including goodwill. The Company did not have any reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.\nThe goodwill impa\nirment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting u\nnits, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions, including assumptions about secular economic and market conditions. The Company uses internal discounted cash flow models to estimate fair value. These cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience, third-party end market data, and future long-term business plans and include assumptions of future sales growth, gross margin, operating margin, terminal growth rate, and the application of an appropriate discount rate. Significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We corroborate the values determined from our discounted cash flow models by reconciling the sum of the estimated fair values of each reporting unit to our market capitalization at the testing date, including consideration of a control premium. We have not recorded any goodwill impairments since the initial adoption of the accounting guidance in 2002.\nThe identification and measurement of impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves either an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired or a quantitative assessment whereby the estimated fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value. If it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles will be determined using discounted cash flow estimates. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the carrying value will be reduced to the estimated fair value. For the Company’s annual impairment test as of April 1, 2023, the Company elected to utilize the quantitative impairment testing process as permitted in the accounting guidance. The estimated fair value was determined utilizing an income approach (relief from royalty method). Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets including assumptions for future revenues, discount rates, royalty rates, and other assumptions, including assumptions about secular economic and market conditions. Significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. As of April 1, 2023, the impairment testing resulted in estimated fair values for each indefinite-lived intangible asset that significantly exceeded the carrying values and there were no indefinite-lived intangible assets at risk of failing the quantitative impairment test. We did not record any impairments related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the information included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, contain “forward-looking statements” as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

    "text": "In the operation of our business, we have various exposures to areas of risk related to factors within and outside the control of management. Significant areas of risk and our strategies to manage the exposure are discussed below.\nIn 2023, we manufactured and/or assembled products in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico, China, the UK, Brazil, Spain, Australia, and the Republic of the Philippines and sold products in those markets as well as through offices in Singapore, Italy, China, Mexico, South Korea and countries in the Middle East. In 2023, Hubbell also participated in joint ventures in Hong Kong and the Republic of the Philippines. As a percentage of the Company’s total Net sales, shipments from foreign operations directly to third parties were 8% in 2023, 8% in 2022 and 9% in 2021, with the UK, Canadian, and Brazilian operations representing approx\nimately\n32%,\n29% and 15%\nrespectively, of 2023 total inte\nrnational Net sales. As such, our operating results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we sell our products. To manage this exposure, we closely monitor the working capital requirements of our international units and may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts.\nProduct purchases representing approximatel\ny 18% o\nf our Net sales are sourced from unaffiliated suppliers located outside the United States, primarily in Mexico, China and other Asian countries, Europe, India and Brazil. Foreign sourcing of products may result in unexpected fluctuations in product cost or increased risk of business interruption due to lack of product or component availability due to any one of the following:\n•\nPolitical or economic uncertainty in the source country\n•\nFluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the source countries\n•\nChanges in U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade\n•\nIncreased logistical complexity including supply chain interruption or delay, port of departure or entry disruption and overall time to market\n•\nLoss of proprietary information\n•\nProduct quality issues outside the control of the Company\nWe have developed plans that address many of these risks. Such actions include careful selection of products to be outsourced and the suppliers selected; ensuring multiple sources of supply; limiting concentrations of activity by port, broker, freight forwarder, etc.; processes related to quality control; and maintaining control over operations, technologies and manufacturing deemed to provide a competitive advantage. Many of our businesses have a dependency on certain basic raw materials needed to produce their products including steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, zinc, nickel, plastics, phenols, elastomers and petrochemicals as well as purchased electrical and electronic components. Our financial results could be affected by the availability and changes in prices of these materials and components.\nCertain of these materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers. These materials are also key source materials for many other companies in our industry and within the universe of industrial manufacturers in general. As such, in periods of rising demand for these materials, we may experience both increased costs and/or limited supply. These conditions can potentially result in our inability to acquire these key materials on a timely basis to produce our products and satisfy our incoming sales orders. Similarly, the cost of these materials can rise suddenly and result in materially higher costs of producing our products. We believe we have adequate primary and secondary sources of supply for each of our key materials and that, in periods of rising prices, we expect to recover a majority of the increased cost in the form of higher selling prices. However, recoveries typically lag the effect of cost increases due to the nature of our markets.\nOur financial results are subject to interest rate fluctuations to the extent there is a difference between the amount of our interest-earning assets and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities. The principal objectives of our investment management activities are to preserve capital while earning net investment income that is commensurate with acceptable levels of interest rate, default and liquidity risk taking into account our funding needs. As part of our investment management strategy, we may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps.\nFrom time to time or when required, we issue commercial paper, which exposes us to changes in interest rates. Our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds held by our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the long-term debt outstanding related to the fixed-rate senior notes was $1,450.0 million. The senior notes are not exposed to interest rate risk as the bonds are at a fixed-rate until maturity. The Company had $600 million outstanding from the Term Loan Agreement at December 31, 2023, and the interest rate is variable based on the adjusted term SOFR rate.\nWe continually evaluate risk retention and insurance levels for product liability, property damage and other potential exposures to risk. We devote significant effort to maintaining and improving safety and internal control programs, which are intended to reduce our exposure to certain risks. We determine the level of insurance coverage and the likelihood of a loss and believe that the current levels of risk retention are consistent with those of comparable companies in the industries in which we operate. There can be no assurance that we will not incur losses beyond the limits of our insurance. However, our liquidity, financial position and profitability are not expected to be materially affected by the levels of risk retention that we accept.\nThe following table presents cost and weighted average interest rate information related to financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, by maturity at December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nWe use derivative financial instruments only if they are matched with a specific asset, liability, or proposed future transaction. We do not speculate or use leverage when trading a financial derivative product."

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on informed judgments made by management.\nWe believe it is critical to provide investors and other users of our financial statements with information that is relevant, objective, understandable and timely, so that they can make informed decisions. As a result, we have established and maintain systems and practices and internal control processes designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that transactions are properly executed and recorded and that our policies and procedures are carried out appropriately. Management strives to recruit, train and retain high quality people to ensure that controls are designed, implemented and maintained in a high-quality, reliable manner.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm audited our financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Their report appears on the next page within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Board of Directors normally meets at least eight times per year to provide oversight, to review corporate strategies and operations, and to assess management’s conduct of the business. The Board of Directors also schedules additional meetings on an as needed basis. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is composed of at least three individuals all of whom must be “independent” under current New York Stock Exchange listing standards and regulations adopted by the SEC under the federal securities laws. The Audit Committee meets regularly with our internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, as well as, management to review, among other matters, accounting, auditing, internal controls and financial reporting issues and practices. Both the internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm have full, unlimited access to the Audit Committee.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate systems of internal control over financial reporting as defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company acquired Northern Star Holdings, Indústria Electromecânica Balestro Ltda., and El Electronics LLC  Inc, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion, net of cash acquired. Because the Company has not yet fully incorporated the internal controls and procedures of the acquired entities into the Company's internal control over financial reporting, management excluded these businesses from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. These entities accounted for 4% of the Company's total assets excluding intangibles and goodwill as of December 31, 2023 and less than 1% of the Company's net sales for the year then ended December 31, 2023.\nIn making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\"). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included below within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo\nthe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Hubbell Incorporated\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hubbell Incorporated and its subsidiaries\n(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nand the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 appearing under Item 15\n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s\nAnnual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nappearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s\nAnnual\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded EI Electronics LLC, Indústria Eletromecânica Balestro Ltda. and Northern Star Holdings from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2023. We have also excluded EI Electronics LLC, Indústria Eletromecânica Balestro Ltda. and Northern Star Holdings\nfrom our audit of internal control over financial reporting. EI Electronics LLC, Indústria Eletromecânica Balestro Ltda. and Northern Star Holdings are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent approximately 4% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated\nfinancial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments – One of the Reporting Units Subject to a Quantitative Assessment\nAs described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $2,533.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Goodwill represents purchase price in excess of fair values of the underlying net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. Management performs its goodwill impairment testing as of April 1st of each year, unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessments. For all four of its reporting units, management elected to utilize the quantitative goodwill impairment testing process as permitted in the accounting guidance by comparing the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units to their carrying values for both assessments. If the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no impairment exists. Goodwill impairment testing requires judgment by management, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Management uses internal discounted cash flow models to estimate fair value. Significant judgments required by management to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions, including assumptions about secular economic and market conditions. These cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience, third party end market data, and future long-term business plans, and include assumptions of future sales growth, gross margin, operating margin, terminal growth rate, and the application of an appropriate discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment for one of the reporting units subject to a quantitative assessment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, and (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to future sales growth, gross margin, operating expenses, and the discount rate.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to future sales growth, gross margin, operating expenses, and the discount rate. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the future sales growth, gross margin, operating expenses, and the discount rate involved evaluating whether the significant assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with industry and third party data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discount rate.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 8, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1961. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company.\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n(1)\nFor accounting purposes, the Company treats repurchased shares as constructively retired when acquired and accordingly charges the purchase price against Common Stock par value, Additional paid-in capital, to the extent available, and Retained earnings. The change in Retained earnings of $\n36.6\nmillion, $\n170.5\nmillion and $\n15.8\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, reflects this accounting treatment.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 1\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the Commercial and Industrial Lighting business (the \"C&I Lighting business\") to GE Current, a Daintree Company, for total net cash consideration of $\n332.8\nmillion. The C&I Lighting business had sales of $\n509.4\nmillion in 2021 as part of the Electrical Solutions segment and designs, manufactures, and sells LED lighting and control solutions for commercial and industrial customers. The disposal of the C&I Lighting business met the criteria set forth in ASC 205-20 to be presented as a discontinued operation. The C&I Lighting business' results of operations and the related cash flows have been presented as income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and cash flows from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively, for all periods presented.\nSee Note 2, Discontinued Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include all wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company participates in\ntwo\njoint ventures that have been consolidated in accordance with the consolidation accounting guidance. An analysis is performed to determine which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (“VIE”) with a primarily qualitative analysis. The qualitative analysis is based on identifying the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (the “power criterion”) and the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE (the “losses/benefit criterion”). The party that meets both these criteria is deemed to have a controlling financial interest. The party with the controlling financial interest is considered to be the primary beneficiary and as a result is required to consolidate the VIE. The Company has a\n50\n% interest in a joint venture in Hong Kong, established as Hubbell Asia Limited (“HAL”). The principal objective of HAL is to manage the operations of its wholly-owned manufacturing company in China. Under the accounting guidance, the Company is the primary beneficiary of HAL and as a result consolidates HAL. This determination is based on the fact that HAL’s sole business purpose is to manufacture product exclusively for the Company (the power criterion) and the Company is financially responsible for ensuring HAL maintains a fixed operating margin (the losses/benefit criterion). The consolidation of HAL is not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from the estimates that are used.\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nThe Company classifies assets and liabilities (disposal groups) to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within\none year\n, except if events or circumstances beyond the Company's control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond\none year\n; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nThe Company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale.\nUpon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group, if material, in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nRefer to Note 4, \"Business Acquisitions and Dispositions,\" of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In conjunction with the residential lighting business being classified as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2023, depreciation and amortization ceased for the residential lighting business during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied, which generally occurs, for products, upon the transfer of control in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the sale. The majority of the Company’s revenue associated with products is recognized at a point in time when the product is shipped to the customer, with a relatively small amount of transactions in the Utility Solutions segment recognized upon delivery of the product at the contractually specified destination.\nThe Company also has performance obligations, primarily within the Utility Solutions segment, that are recognized over time due to the customized nature of the product and the Company's enforceable right to receive payment for work performed to date in the event of a cancellation. The Company uses an input measure to determine the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, which the Company believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under this method, revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.\nRevenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is approximately\ntwo\npercent of total annual consolidated net revenue and those service contracts and post-shipment obligations are primarily within the Utility Solutions segment. Revenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is recognized when or as those obligations are satisfied. The Company primarily offers assurance-type standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations and on occasion will separately offer and price extended warranties that are separate performance obligations for which the associated revenue is recognized over-time based on the extended warranty period. The Company records amounts billed to customers for reimbursement of shipping and handling costs within revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of goods sold. Sales taxes and other usage-based taxes are excluded from revenue.\nWithin the Electrical Solutions segment, certain businesses require a portion of the transaction price to be paid in advance of transfer of control. Advance payments are not considered a significant financing component as they are received less than one year before the related performance obligations are satisfied. In addition, in the Utility Solutions segment, certain businesses offer annual maintenance service contracts that require payment at the beginning of the contract period. These payments are treated as a contract liability and are classified in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Once control transfers to the customer and the Company meets the revenue recognition criteria, the deferred revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The deferred revenue relating to the annual maintenance service contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight line basis over the expected term of the contract.\nThe Company has certain arrangements that require us to estimate at the time of sale the amounts of variable consideration that should not be recorded as revenue as certain amounts are not expected to be collected from customers, as well as an estimate of the value of the product to be returned. The Company principally relies on historical experience, specific customer agreements and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of shipment and to reduce the transaction price. These arrangements include sales discounts and allowances based on sales volumes, specific programs and special pricing allowances, and returned goods, as are customary in the electrical products industry. Customer returns have historically been approximately\n1\n% of gross sales.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nThe Company records shipping and handling costs as part of Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the year, and income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. The effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the translated amounts of foreign currency assets and liabilities are included as translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss within Hubbell shareholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities to the Company of three months or less.\nInvestments\nInvestments in debt and equity securities are classified by individual security as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity or trading securities. Our available-for-sale securities, consisting of municipal bonds, are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with current period adjustments to carrying value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss within Hubbell shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Realized gains and losses are recorded in income in the period of sale. The Company’s trading securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value and consist primarily of debt and equity mutual funds. Gains and losses associated with these trading securities are reflected in the results of operations.\nThe Company did\nno\nt have any investments classified as held-to-maturity as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an estimated amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The allowance is calculated based upon a combination of historical write-off experience, fixed percentages applied to aging categories and specific identification based upon a review of past due balances and problem accounts. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is determined that internal collection efforts should no longer be pursued. The Company also maintains a reserve for credit memos and cash discounts which are principally calculated based upon historical experience, specific customer agreements, and anticipated future trends.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Approximately\n45\n% of total net inventory value is determined utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory accounting. The cost of foreign inventories and certain domestic inventories is determined utilizing average cost or first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods of inventory accounting. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are provided based on current assessments about future demand compared to on-hand quantities.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment values are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures that do not significantly increase the life of an asset are charged to expense when incurred. Property, plant, and equipment placed in service prior to January 1, 1999 are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, principally, using accelerated methods. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the lease term. Gains and losses arising on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are included in Operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nCapitalized Computer Software Costs\nCapitalized computer software costs, net of amortization, were $\n5.8\nmillion and $\n7.0\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This balance is reflected in Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Capitalized computer software is for internal use and costs primarily consist of purchased materials, external services and salary costs for personnel dedicated to the projects. Software is amortized on a straight-line basis over appropriate periods, generally between\nthree\nand\nfive years\n. The Company recorded amortization expense of $\n4.3\nmillion in 2023, $\n6.6\nmillion in 2022 and $\n9.6\nmillion in 2021 relating to capitalized computer software.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents purchase price in excess of fair values of the underlying net assets of acquired companies. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are subject to annual impairment testing using the specific guidance and criteria described in the accounting guidance. The Company performs its goodwill impairment testing as of April 1st of each year, unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessments. The accounting guidance provides entities an option of performing a qualitative assessment (a \"step-zero\" test) before performing a quantitative analysis. If the entity determines, on the basis of certain qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill is not impaired, the entity would not need to proceed to quantitative goodwill impairment testing process as prescribed in the guidance. For each of the Company's\nfour\nreporting units in 2023, the Company elected to utilize the quantitative goodwill impairment testing process, as permitted in the accounting guidance, by comparing the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units to their carrying values. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no impairment exists.\nGoodwill impairment testing requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions, including assumptions about secular economic and market conditions. The Company uses internal discounted cash flow models to estimate fair value. These cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience, third party end market data, and future long-term business plans and include assumptions on future sales growth, gross margin, operating margin, terminal growth rate, and the application of an appropriate discount rate. Significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The Company believes that its estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units is reasonable when compared to the Company's market capitalization on the valuation date.\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2023. The impairment testing resulted in implied fair values for each reporting unit that exceeded such reporting unit's carrying value, by at least\n47\n%, including goodwill. Additionally, the Company did not have any reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. The Company has not recorded any goodwill impairments since the initial adoption of the accounting guidance in 2002.\nThe Company’s intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, tradenames, developed technology and patents. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from\n5\n-\n30\nyears. The Company amortizes intangible assets with definite lives using either an accelerated method that reflects the pattern in which economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed and results in higher amortization in the earlier years of the assets' useful life, or using a straight line method. Approximately\n85\n% of the gross value of definite-lived intangible assets follow an accelerated amortization method. These definite lived intangibles are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. The Company did\nno\nt record any material impairments related to its definite lived intangible assets in 2023, 2022 or 2021. The Company also has some tradenames that are considered to be indefinite-lived intangible assets. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually, unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessment.\nThe identification and measurement of impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves either an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired or a quantitative assessment whereby the estimated fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value. If it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangibles will be determined using discounted cash flow estimates. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the carrying value will be reduced to the estimated fair value.\nFor the Company’s annual impairment test as of April 1, 2023, the Company elected to utilize the quantitative impairment testing process as permitted in the accounting guidance. The estimated fair value was determined utilizing an income approach (relief from royalty method). Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets including assumptions for future revenues, discount rates, royalty rates, and other assumptions, including assumptions about secular economic and market conditions. Significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. As of April 1, 2023, the impairment testing resulted in estimated fair values for each indefinite-lived intangible asset that significantly exceeded the carrying values and there were no indefinite-lived intangible assets at risk of failing the quantitative impairment test.\nThe Company did not record any impairments related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews depreciable long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. If such a change in circumstances occurs, the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is compared to the carrying amount. If the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded. The impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. The fair value of impaired assets is determined using expected cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included as ROU assets within other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, and other non-current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant, and equipment, net, other accrued liabilities, and other non-current liabilities. The Company's finance leases are immaterial.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use an implicit rate when readily determinable. For leases existing as of January 1, 2019, we have elected to use the remaining lease term as of the adoption date in determining the incremental borrowing rate. Our determination of the lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. Additionally, for our vehicle leases, we apply a portfolio approach regarding the assumed lease term.\nAccrued Insurance\nThe Company retains a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation, medical, automobile and general liability insurance. The Company estimates self-insurance liabilities using a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on the Company’s estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The Company periodically reviews the assumptions with a third party actuary to determine the adequacy of these self-insurance reserves.\nAccrued Warranty\nThe Company offers product warranties which cover defects on most of its products. These warranties primarily apply to products that are properly installed, maintained and used for their intended purposes. The Company accrues estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. Estimated warranty expenses, recorded in cost of goods sold, are based upon historical information such as past experience, product failure rates, or the estimated number of units to be repaired or replaced. Adjustments are made to the product warranty accrual as claims are incurred, additional information becomes known or as historical experience indicates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The IRS and other tax authorities routinely examine the Company’s tax returns. These audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve. The Company makes adequate provisions for best estimates of exposures on previously filed tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequence of differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities by applying the currently enacted statutory tax rates in accordance with the accounting guidance for income taxes. The effect of a change in statutory tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Additionally, deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company uses factors to assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets such as the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.\nIn addition, the accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For any amount of benefit to be recognized, it must be determined that it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount of benefit to be recognized is based on the Company’s assertion of the most likely outcome resulting from an examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. Companies are required to reflect only those tax positions that are more-likely-than-not to be sustained. See Note 14 — Income Taxes for additional information.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenditures represent costs to discover and/or apply new knowledge in developing a new product, process, or in bringing about a significant improvement to an existing product or process. Research and development expenses are recorded as a component of Cost of goods sold.\nExpenses for research and development were approximatel\ny\n2\n% o\nf Net Sales in 2023 and\n2\n% in each of\n2022 and 2021.\nGovernment Assistance\nIn 2022 we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832)\nDisclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,\nwhich requires footnote disclosure of assistance received from government entities. We record amounts received from government entities as a reduction of the associated expense. Amounts received related to depreciable assets are recognized as a reduction to depreciation expense. The total impact of government assistance was not material to the Company in 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nRetirement Benefits\nThe Company maintains various defined benefit pension plans for some of its U.S. and foreign employees. The accounting guidance for retirement benefits requires the Company to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations that have not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost as of the end of the year are recognized as components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, within Hubbell shareholders’ equity. The Company’s policy is to fund pension costs within the ranges prescribed by applicable regulations. In addition to providing defined benefit pension benefits, the Company provides health care and life insurance benefits for some of its active and retired employees. The Company’s policy is to fund these benefits through insurance premiums or as actual expenditures are made. See also Note 12 — Retirement Benefits.\nEarnings Per Share\nRestricted stock granted by the Company is considered a participating security since it contains a non-forfeitable right to dividends. As a result, the earnings per share accounting guidance requires the Company to use the two-class method for calculating earnings per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and participating securities. Basic earnings per share is calculated as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Earnings per diluted share is calculated as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding of common stock plus the incremental shares outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive stock appreciation rights and performance shares. See also Note 19 — Earnings Per Share.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes the grant-date fair value of all stock-based awards on a straight-line basis over their respective requisite service periods (generally equal to an award’s vesting period). A stock-based award is considered vested for expense attribution purposes when the retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes compensation cost immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period. The expense is recorded in Cost of goods sold and S&A expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income based on the recipients’ respective functions within the organization.\nThe Company records deferred tax assets for awards that will result in deductions on its tax returns, based upon the amount of compensation cost recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it will receive a deduction. See also Note 18 — Stock-Based Compensation.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, \"Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50: Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations)\", which the Company adopted in the first quarter of 2023, with the exception of the rollforward information, which is effective for the Company in 2024.\nPayment Services Arrangements\nThe Company has ongoing agreements with financial institutions to facilitate the processing of vendor payables. Under these agreements, the Company pays the financial institution the stated amount of confirmed invoices from participating suppliers on their original maturity date. The terms of the vendor payables are not affected by vendors participating in these agreements.  As a result, the amounts owed are presented as\naccounts payable\nin the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which $\n101.3\nmillion and $\n91.9\nmillion was outstanding at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Either party may terminate the agreements with 30 days written notice. Cash flows under the program are reported in operating activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nCommercial Card Program\nIn 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with a financial institution that allows participating suppliers to receive payment for outstanding invoices through a commercial purchasing card sponsored by a financial institution.  The Company is required to then settle such outstanding invoices through a consolidated payment to the financial institution\n15\ndays after the commercial card billing cycle. The Company receives the benefit of extended payment terms and a rebate from the financial institution. Either party may terminate the agreement with\n60\ndays written notice. The amount outstanding to the financial institution is presented as short-term debt in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which, $\n2.0\nmillion and $\n1.9\nmillion was outstanding at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Cash flows under the program are reported in financing activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\", which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which extends the temporary accounting rules under Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. The Company continues to assess the impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements and the timing of adoption.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting-Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\", which adds a requirement for public entities to disclose its significant segment expense categories and amounts for each reportable segment for all periods presented. This information is required to be disclosed at both interim and annual periods. In addition, this ASU requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") in the consolidated financial statements. Public entities are also required to disclose how the CODM uses each reported measure of segment profit or loss to assess performance and allocate resources to the segments. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is assessing the impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\", which enhances the disaggregation of income tax disclosures. The ASU requires public entities on an annual basis to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold equal to or greater than 5%. Public entities are required to provide an explanation of certain rate reconciling items if not otherwise evident, such as the nature, causes and judgement used to categorize the item. The ASU also requires disclosure of income taxes paid (net of refund received) detailed by federal, state/local and foreign, and amounts paid to individual jurisdictions that are equal or greater than 5% of total income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and for interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. The Company is assessing the impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements.\nNOTE 2\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the C&I Lighting business to GE Current, a Daintree Company, for total net cash consideration of $\n332.8\nmillion. We have concluded the divestiture of this business represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results, and as a result, is reported as a discontinued operation in our Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. The C&I Lighting business was previously included in the Electrical Solutions segment.\nUnder the terms of the transaction, the Company and the buyer entered into a transition services agreement (\"TSA\"), pursuant to which the Company provides certain administrative and operational services for a period of\n12\nmonths or less. Furthermore, we entered into a short-term supply agreement whereby the Company acts as a supplier of finished goods and component parts to the C&I Lighting business after the completion of the sale. Income from the TSA and supply agreement was $\n13.3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and was recorded in Other Income in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents the summarized components of income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for the Commercial and Industrial Lighting business:\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 includes pre-tax transaction and separation costs of\n$\n0.0 million\nand\n$\n8.8\nmillion, respectively.\nNOTE 3\nRevenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied, which generally occurs, for products, upon the transfer of control in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the sale. Approximately three-fourths of the Company's Net sales are to distributors who then sell directly into our end markets. Within the Utility Solutions segment, our businesses sell to distributors, with the majority of sales to the utility end markets and also directly into transmission and distribution utility markets. The majority of the Company’s revenue associated with products is recognized at a point in time when the product is shipped to the customer, with a relatively small amount of transactions, primarily in the Utility Solutions segment, recognized upon delivery of the product at the destination.\nThe Company also has performance obligations, primarily within the Utility Solutions segment, that are recognized over time due to the customized nature of the product and the Company's enforceable right to receive payment for work performed to date in the event of a cancellation. The Company uses an input measure to determine the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, which the Company believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under this method, revenue recognition is primarily based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.\nRevenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is recognized when or as those obligations are satisfied. The Company primarily offers assurance-type standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations and on occasion will separately offer and price extended warranties that are separate performance obligations for which the associated revenue is recognized over-time based on the extended warranty period. The Company records amounts billed to customers for reimbursement of shipping and handling costs within revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of goods sold. Sales taxes and other usage-based taxes are excluded from revenue.\nWithin the Electrical Solutions segment, certain businesses require a portion of the transaction price to be paid in advance of transfer of control. Advance payments are not considered a significant financing component as they are received less than one year before the related performance obligations are satisfied. In addition, in the Utility Solutions segment, certain businesses offer annual maintenance service contracts that require payment at the beginning of the contract period. These payments are treated as a contract liability and are classified in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once control transfers to the customer and the Company meets the revenue recognition criteria, the deferred revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The deferred revenue relating to the annual maintenance service contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the contract.\nThe following table presents disaggregated revenue by business group.\nThe following table presents disaggregated third-party Net sales by geographic location (on a geographic basis, the Company defines \"international\" as operations based outside of the United States and its possessions):\nContract Balances\nOur contract liabilities consist of advance payments for products as well as deferred revenue on service obligations and extended warranties. The current portion of deferred revenue is included in Other accrued liabilities and the non-current portion of deferred revenue is included in Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nContract liabilities were $\n118.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 compared to $\n45.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. The $\n72.8\nmillion increase in our contract liabilities balance was primarily due to a $\n46.7\nmillion net increase in current year deferrals primarily due to timing of advance payments on certain orders and a $\n68.1\nmillion increase due to acquisitions, partially offset by the recognition of $\n42.0\nmillion in revenue related to amounts that were recorded in contract liabilities at January 1, 2023. The Systems Control acquisition resulted in the Company acquiring contract assets of $\n45.7\nmillion, which represent performance obligations satisfied prior to payment that are recorded in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ending balance of contract assets as of December 31, 2023 was $\n41.6\nmillion. Impairment losses recognized on our receivables and contract assets were immaterial in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. See Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUnsatisfied Performance Obligations\nThe Company has elected the practical expedient to disclose only the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length greater than one year.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $\n200\nmillion of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year, primarily relating to long-term contracts of the Aclara business (within the Utility Solutions segment) to deliver and install meters, metering communications and grid monitoring sensor technology. The Company expects that a majority of the unsatisfied performance obligations will be completed and recognized over the next\n2\nyears.\nNOTE 4\nBusiness Acquisitions and Dispositions\n2023 Acquisitions\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023 the Company acquired Northern Star Holdings, Inc., (\"Systems Control\") for approximately $\n1.1\nbillion, net of cash acquired, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.

The goodwill relates to a number of factors implied in the purchase prices, including the future earnings and cash flow potential of the businesses as well as the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies that such business acquisitions bring to the Company’s existing operations.\nAllocation of Consideration Transferred to Net Assets Acquired\nThe following table presents the preliminary determination of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Company's 2023 acquisitions. Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The purchase accounting associated with the December 12, 2023 acquisition of System Controls is preliminary as of December 31, 2023. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company's results of operations.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the respective date of acquisition for all of the Company's 2023 acquisitions (in millions):\nCash used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 is $\n1,211.7\nmillion and excludes approximately $\n7.2\nmillion of deferred purchase price related to the Balestro acquisition.\nThe purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired for all of the 2023 acquisitions is as follows (in millions, except useful life amounts):\nCustomer relationships and developed technology intangible assets acquired are amortized using an accelerated method that reflects the pattern in which economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed and results in higher amortization in the earlier years of the asset's useful life.\nSupplemental Pro-forma Data\nThe results of operations for the 2023 acquisitions have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the acquisitions on their respective dates. Acquisitions contributed sales of approximately $\n41.4\nmillion and operating income of approximately $\n0.0 million\n, before any transaction costs described below, for the period from the completion of the acquisitions through December 31, 2023.\nThe following unaudited supplemental pro-forma information presents consolidated results as if the acquisitions had been completed on January 1, 2022.  Following that approach, for the purpose of the pro-forma results presented in the tables below, certain costs incurred by the Company during 2023 have been reclassified into the pro-forma 2022 period.\nThose reclassifications primarily include the following, which represent the amount of increase or (decrease) to reported results to arrive at the pro-forma results (in millions, except per share amounts).\n(1)\nTransaction costs incurred in 2023 have been reclassified into the comparative pro-forma 2022 period.\n(2)\nIntangible amortization and inventory step up amortization incurred in 2023 have been reclassified into the comparable pro-forma 2022 period and increased to reflect the assumption the transactions were completed on January 1, 2022. The pro-forma 2023 period includes the intangible amortization that would be incurred assuming the transactions had been completed on January 1, 2022.\n(3)\nInterest expense incurred in 2023, reflecting amounts incurred from the date of the acquisitions, has been reclassified into the pro-forma 2022 period and increased to reflect the assumption the transactions were completed on January 1, 2022. The pro-forma 2023 period includes the interest expense that would have been incurred assuming the transactions had been completed on January 1, 2022.\nThe pro-forma results were calculated by combining the results of the Company with the stand-alone results of the acquisitions for the pre-acquisition periods, as described above:\nThe unaudited supplemental pro-forma financial information does not reflect the actual performance of the 2023 acquisitions in the periods presented and does not reflect the potential realization of cost savings relating to the integration of the acquisitions with Hubbell. Further, the pro-forma data should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisitions and related financing had been consummated on January 1, 2022, nor are they indicative of future results.\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nIn December 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its residential lighting business for a cash purchase price of $\n131\nmillion, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024.

The goodwill relates to a number of factors implied in the purchase prices, including the future earnings and cash flow potential of the businesses as well as the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies that such business acquisitions bring to the Company’s existing operations.\nAllocation of Consideration Transferred to Net Assets Acquired\nThe following table presents the determination of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Company's 2022 acquisitions. Fair value est\nimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company's results of operations.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the respective date of acquisition for all of the Company's 2022 acquisitions (in millions):\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of operations of the acquired businesses from their respective dates of acquisition. Net sales and earnings related to these acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2022 were not significant to the consolidated results. Pro-forma information related to these acquisitions has not been included because the impact to the Company's consolidated results of operations was not material.\nDispositions\nIn June 2021, the Company completed the sale of the Consumer Analytics Solutions business for $\n9.8\nmillion. The Consumer Analytics Solutions business was part of Aclara and was previously included in the Utility Solutions segment.

As a result of the sale of the Consumer Analytics Solutions business, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $\n6.9\nmillion that is included in Total other expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nNOTE 5\nReceivables and Allowances\nReceivables consist of the following components at December 31, (in millions):\nNOTE 6\nInventories\nInventories are classified as follows at December 31, (in millions):\nNOTE 7\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nChanges in the carrying amounts of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, by segment, were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nRefer to Note 4 – Business Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information.\nIn 2023, the Company completed multiple acquisitions. These acquisitions have been accounted for as business combinations and have resulted in the recognition of $\n614.7\nmillion of goodwill. The Company has not recorded any goodwill impairments since the initial adoption of the related accounting guidance in 2002.\nIdentifiable intangible assets are recorded in Other intangible assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of the following (in millions):\nAmortization expense associated with these definite-lived intangible assets was $\n73.5\nmillion, $\n75.7\nmillion and $\n75.7\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n. Amortization expense associated with these intangible assets is expected to be\n$\n114.4\nmillion\nin 2024,\n$\n95.7\nmillion\nin 2025,\n$\n90.3\nmillion\nin 2026,\n$\n85.7\nmillion\nin 2027 and\n$\n82.2\nmillion\nin 2028.\nThe Company amortizes intangible assets with definite lives using either an accelerated method that reflects the pattern in which economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed and results in higher amortization in the earlier years of the assets' useful life, or using a straight line method. Approximately\n85\n%\nof the gross value of definite-lived intangible assets follow an accelerated amortization method.\nNOTE 8\nInvestments\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held investments classified as available-for-sale and investments classified as trading securities. Investments classified as available-for-sale consisted of municipal bonds with an amortized cost basis of $\n65.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. Investments classified as trading securities were composed primarily of debt and equity mutual funds and are stated at fair market value based on current quotes.\nThe following table sets forth selected data with respect to the Company’s investments at December 31, (in millions):\nContractual maturities of our investments in available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nThe total unrealized gain/(loss) recognized in the year relating to available-for-sale securities, net of tax, was\n$\n0.6\nmillion and\n$(\n1.4\n) million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These net unrealized gains/(losses) are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. Net unrealized gains relating to trading securities have been reflected in the results of operations. The Company uses the specific identification method when identifying the cost basis used to calculate the gain or loss on these securities. Gains and losses for both available-for-sale and trading securities were not material in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had $\n65.0\nmillion and $\n61.4\nmillion, respectively, of available-for-sale municipal debt securities. These investments had an amortized cost of $\n65.3\nmillion and $\n62.6\nmillion, respectively.\nNo\nallowance for credit losses related to our available-for-sale debt securities was recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 the unrealized losses attributable to our available-for-sale debt securities was $\n0.6\nmillion and $\n1.3\nmillion, respectively. The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses was $\n34.5\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and $\n53.7\nmillion at December 31, 2022.\nNOTE 9\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment, carried at cost, is summarized as follows at December 31, (in millions):\nDepreciable lives on buildings range between\n20\n-\n45\nyears. Depreciable lives on machinery, tools, and equipment range between\n3\n-\n15\nyears. The Company recorded depreciation expense of $\n71.9\nmillion, $\n63.4\nmillion and $\n61.7\nmillion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNOTE 10\nOther Accrued Liabilities\nOther accrued liabilities consist of the following at December 31, (in millions):\n(1)\nRefer to Note 22\n–\nGuarantees for additional information regarding warranties.\nNOTE 11\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nOther non-current liabilities consist of the following at December 31, (in millions):\n(1)\nRefer to Note 22\n–\nGuarantees for additional information regarding warranties.\nNOTE 12\nRetirement Benefits\nThe Company has funded and unfunded non-contributory U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans. Benefits under these plans are generally provided based on either years of service and final average pay or a specified dollar amount per year of service. The U.S. defined benefit pension plan has been closed to new participants since 2004, while the Canadian and UK defined benefit pension plans have been closed to new entrants since 2006 and 2007, respectively. These U.S., Canadian and UK employees are eligible instead for defined contribution plans.\nThe Company also has a number of health care and life insurance benefit plans covering eligible employees who reached retirement age while working for the Company. These benefits have been discontinued for substantially all future retirees. The Company anticipates future cost-sharing charges for its discontinued plans that are consistent with past practices. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all of its plans.\nIn 2022, the Company recognized a settlement loss in continuing operations relating to retirees that elected to receive lump-sum distributions from the Company's defined benefit pension plans of $\n7.0\nmillion. This charge was the result of lump-sum payments which exceeded the threshold for settlement accounting under U.S. GAAP\n.\nThe Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans were approximately\n89\n% of the $\n674.9\nmillion total pension benefit obligations at December 31, 2023.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligations and the plan assets for the Company’s defined benefit pension and other benefit plans at December 31, (in millions):\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n674.9\nmillion and $\n670.8\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInformation with respect to plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets is as follows, (in millions):\nThe following table sets forth the components of pension and other benefit costs for the years ended December 31, (in millions):\nDuring 2022, the Company recognized $\n7.0\nmillion of settlement losses in continuing operations and $\n1.8\nmillion of settlement losses in discontinued operations. Those settlement losses are the result of lump-sum distributions from the Company's defined benefit pension plans which exceeded the threshold for settlement accounting under U.S. GAAP for the year.\nThe Company also maintains\nfour\nprimary defined contribution pension plans. The total cost of the Company's defined contribution plans was $\n32.3\nmillion in 2023, $\n25.8\nmillion in 2022 and $\n23.3\nmillion in 2021, excluding the employer match for the 401(k) plan. This cost is not included in the above net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit pension plans.\nIn 2021 and 2022 the Company participated in\none\nmulti-employer defined benefit pension plan. The Company’s total contributions while participating in this plan was $\n0.2\nmillion in 2021 and $\n0.2\nmillion in 2022.\nThe risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may have to be assumed by the remaining participant employers. If we choose to stop participating in a multi-employer plan we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability based on the unfunded status of the plan.\nAssumptions\nThe following assumptions were used to determine the projected benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit cost for the year:\nAt the end of each year, the Company determines the appropriate expected return on assets for each plan based upon its strategic asset allocation (see discussion below). In making this determination, the Company utilizes expected returns for each asset class based upon current market conditions and expected risk premiums for each asset class.\nThe Company also determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities at the end of each year. The discount rate for the Company’s U.S. and Canadian pension plans is determined by matching the expected cash flows associated with its benefit obligations to the expected cash flows of a hypothetical portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that closely match the expected funding period of its pension liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, the Company used a discount rate of\n5.20\n% for its U.S. pension plans compared to a discount rate of\n5.50\n% used in 2022. For its Canadian pension plan, the Company used a discount rate of\n4.61\n% as of December 31, 2023 compared to a\n5.01\n% discount rate used in 2022.\nFor its UK pension plan the discount rate was derived using a full yield curve and uses plan specific cash flows. The derived discount rate is the single discount rate equivalent to discounting these liability cash flows at the term-dependent spot rate of AA corporate bonds. This methodology resulted in a December 31, 2023 discount rate for the UK pension plan of\n4.80\n% as compared to a discount rate of\n5.00\n% used in 2022.\nIn 2021, 2022 and 2023 we used the Pri-2012 mortality table and adopted the MP-2021 projection scale to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities. The Pri-2012 mortality table with adjustment for collar as appropriate and generational projection from 2012 using Scale MP-2021 was chosen as the best estimate based on the observed and anticipated experience of the plans after considering alternative tables.\nThe rate of compensation increase assumption reflects the Company’s actual experience and best estimate of future increases.\nThe assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the projected postretirement benefit obligation are as follows:\nPlan Assets\nThe Company’s combined targeted 2024 weighted average asset allocation for domestic and foreign pension plans and the actual weighted average asset allocation for domestic and foreign pension plans at December 31, 2023\nand\n2022 by asset category are as follows:\nAt the end of each year, the Company estimates the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets based on the strategic asset allocation for its plans. In making this determination, the Company utilizes expected rates of return for each asset class based upon current market conditions and expected risk premiums for each asset class. The Company has written investment policies and asset allocation guidelines for its domestic and foreign pension plans. In establishing these policies, the Company has considered that its various pension plans are a major retirement vehicle for most plan participants and has acted to discharge its fiduciary responsibilities with regard to the plans solely in the interest of such participants and their beneficiaries. The goal underlying the establishment of the investment policies is to provide that pension assets shall be invested in a prudent manner and so that, together with the expected contributions to the plans, the funds will be sufficient to meet the obligations of the plans as they become due.\nTo achieve this result, the Company conducts a periodic strategic asset allocation study to form a basis for the allocation of pension assets between various asset categories. Specific policy benchmark percentages are assigned to each asset category with minimum and maximum ranges established for each. The assets are then tactically managed within these ranges. Derivative investments include futures contracts used by the plan to adjust the level of its investments within an asset allocation category. The actual and target percentages reported in the preceding table reflect the economic exposure to each asset category, including the impact of derivative positions. All futures contracts are\n100\n% supported by cash or cash equivalent investments. At no time may derivatives be utilized to leverage the asset portfolio. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\nno\nholdings of Company stock in pension plan assets.\nThe Company’s other post-employment benefits are unfunded; therefore, no asset information is reported.\nThe fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, by asset category are as follows (in millions):\n(a)\nInvestments in Common Pooled Equity Funds, including funds and fund products investing in various equity securities.\n(b)\nIncludes primarily investment grade bonds from diverse industries\n(c)\nInvestments in Common Pooled Fixed Income Funds, including funds and fund products investing in various fixed income investments\n(d)\nIncludes investments in hedge funds, including fund of funds products and open-end mutual funds\n(e)\nInvestments in Common Pooled Funds, consisting of equities and fixed income securities\nInvestments priced using Net Asset Value (\"NAV\") within Alternative Investment Funds and Common Pooled Fixed Income Funds in the preceding tables consist of fund of fund products. These products invest in a number of investment funds managed by a diversified group of third-party investment managers who employ a variety of investment strategies, including relative value, security selection, distressed value, global macro, specialized credit and directional strategies. The objective of these funds is to achieve the desired capital appreciation or fixed income as applicable with lower volatility than either traditional equity or fixed income securities.\nContributions\nIn 2021, there were\nno\ncontributions to the Company's U.S. qualified plans required by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Company contributed $\n10.0\nmillion and $\n2.5\nmillion to its U.S. and foreign qualified plans, respectively, in 2022.  The Company contributed $\n20.0\nmillion\nto its U.S. qualified plans\nin 2023.\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nThe following domestic and foreign benefit payments, which reflect future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows (in millions):\nNOTE 13\nDebt\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, (in millions):\n(a)\nLong-term debt is presented net of debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts.\nIn December 2023, the Company entered into a new Term Loan Agreement (the \"Term Loan Agreement\") with a syndicate of lenders under which the Company borrowed $\n600\nmillion on an unsecured basis to partially finance the Systems Control acquisition, which was completed on December 12, 2023. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest generally at either the adjusted term SOFR rate plus an applicable margin (determined by a ratings based grid) or the alternative base rate. Currently the loans bear interest based on the adjusted term SOFR rate, which was\n6.72\n% as of December 31, 2023. The principal amount of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement amortize in equal quarterly installments of\n2.5\n% in year one,\n2.5\n% in year two, and\n5\n% in year three, with the remaining borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement due and payable in full at maturity in December 2026. The Company may make principal payments in excess of the amortization schedule at its discretion. The sole financial covenant in the Term Loan Agreement requires that total debt not exceed\n65\n% of total capitalization as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company. The Company was in compliance with this covenant as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company, as borrower, and its subsidiaries Hubbell Power Holdings S.à r.l. and Harvey Hubbell Holdings S.à r.l., each as a subsidiary borrower (collectively, the “Subsidiary Borrowers”), are parties to a\nfive-year\ncredit agreement with a syndicate of lenders and JPMorgan Chase, N.A., as administrative agent, that provides a $\n750\nmillion committed revolving credit facility (the \"2021 Credit Facility\"), which matures on March 12, 2026. Commitments under the 2021 Credit Facility may be increased to an aggregate amount not to exceed $\n1.25\nbillion. The 2021 Credit Facility includes a $\n50\nmillion sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The sum of the dollar amount of loans and letters of credit to the Subsidiary Borrowers under the 2021 Credit Facility may not exceed $\n75\nmillion.\nThe interest rate applicable to borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility is either (i) the alternate base rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) or (ii) the adjusted SOFR rate plus an applicable margin (determined by a ratings based grid).\nThe 2021 Credit Facility contains a sole financial covenant requiring that, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization shall not be greater than\n65\n%. The Company was in compliance with this covenant as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the 2021 Credit Facility was undrawn.\nIn connection with entry into the 2021 Credit Facility, the Company terminated all commitments under the existing credit facility dated as of January 31, 2018.\nOn March 12, 2021, the Company completed a public offering of $\n300\nmillion aggregate principal amount of its\n2.300\n% Senior Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”). The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $\n295.5\nmillion after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2031 Notes, together with cash on hand, to redeem in full all of the Company’s outstanding\n3.625\n% Senior Notes due 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of $\n300\nmillion, which had a stated maturity date of November 15, 2022 (the “2022 Notes”), and to pay any premium and accrued interest in respect thereof, which redemption was completed on April 2, 2021. The redemption resulted in a $\n16.8\nmillion loss on extinguishment of indebtedness that was recognized in the second quarter of 2021. The loss on extinguishment includes a cash premium of $\n16.0\nmillion paid upon redemption in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Notes.\nThe 2031 Notes bear interest at a rate of\n2.300\n% per annum from March 12, 2021. Interest on the 2031 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2021. The 2031 Notes will mature on March 15, 2031.\nThe 2031 Notes are callable at any time with a make whole premium and are only subject to accelerated payment prior to maturity in the event of a default (including as a result of the Company's failure to meet certain non-financial covenants) under the indenture governing the notes or upon a change in control triggering event as defined in such indenture. The Company was in compliance with all non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2023.\nIn February 2018, the Company completed a public offering of $\n450\nmillion of senior, unsecured, notes maturing in February 2028 and bearing interest at a fixed rate of\n3.50\n% (the \"2028 Notes\").

The Company was in compliance with all non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $\n117.4\nmillion and $\n4.7\nmillion, respectively, of short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt outstanding composed of:\n◦\n$\n100\nmillion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023, which was used to fund the Systems Control acquisition. There was\nno\ncommercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\n◦\n$\n15.0\nmillion of long-term debt classified as short-term within current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, reflecting maturities within the next 12 months relating to borrowing under the Term Loan Agreement at December 31, 2023.\n◦\n$\n2.4\nmillion and $\n4.7\nmillion short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, which consisted of borrowings to support our international operations in China and amounts outstanding under our commercial card program.\nOther information related to short-term debt at December 31, is summarized below:\nThe Company also maintains other lines of credit that are primarily used to support the issuance of letters of credit. Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions. At December 31, 2023 and 2022 these lines totaled $\n55.9\nmillion and $\n55.8\nmillion, respectively, of which $\n23.4\nmillion and $\n31.7\nmillion was utilized to support letters of credit and the remaining amount was unused. The annual commitment fees associated with these lines of credit are not material.\nInterest and fees paid related to total indebtedness was $\n49.9\nmillion, $\n47.5\nmillion and $\n65.6\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $\n65.6\nmillion paid in 2021 includes $\n16.0\nmillion related to the make whole payment for the extinguishment of the 2022 Notes.\nNOTE 14\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table sets forth selected data with respect to the Company’s income tax provisions of continuing operations for the years ended December 31, (in millions):\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities result from differences in the basis of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes. The components of the deferred tax assets/(liabilities) of continuing operations at December 31, were as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had a total of $\n26.1\nmillion of U.S. federal, state (net of federal benefit) and foreign tax credit carryforwards, available to offset future income taxes. As of December 31, 2023, $\n1.9\nmillion of the tax credits may be carried forward indefinitely while the remaining $\n24.2\nmillion will begin to expire at various times in 2024 through 2052. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had recorded tax benefits totaling $\n12.7\nmillion for U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). As of December 31, 2023, $\n5.2\nmillion of NOLs may be carried forward indefinitely while the remaining $\n7.5\nmillion will begin to expire at various times in 2024 through 2052. The tax benefit related to a portion of these NOLs has been adjusted to reflect an “ownership change” pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of pre-acquisition operating losses. The Company has recorded a net valuation allowance of $\n37.4\nmillion on certain deferred tax assets including a portion of foreign and state tax credit carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and NOLs that the Company anticipates will expire prior to utilization.\nDuring 2023, the Company repatriated certain of its foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2023, the Company also anticipates repatriating certain of its foreign earnings in the future. The accompanying financial statements reflect the income tax expense associated with actual and anticipated remittances related to certain of our outside basis differences. The Company has not provided for the income tax effects of distributing the remaining approximately $\n513\nmillion of undistributed foreign earnings as those amounts are either permanently reinvested or intended to be reinvested in our international operations. It is not practicable to estimate the tax cost associated with a remittance of such earnings.\nCash payments of income taxes were $\n215.0\nmillion, $\n168.0\nmillion and $\n84.0\nmillion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The IRS and other tax authorities routinely audit the Company’s tax returns. These audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve. In January 2023 the Company completed its 2018 U.S. federal tax examination with no material adjustments. The Company is currently not under a U.S. tax audit. The Company is under audit in the UK for the tax year 2021.  With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state, local, or income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2019.\nThe following tax years, by major jurisdiction, are still subject to examination by taxing authorities:\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\nIncluded in the balance at December 31, 2023 are approximately $\n37.8\nmillion of tax positions which, if in the future are determined to be recognizable, would affect the annual effective income tax rate. Additionally, there are $\n4.6\nmillion of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the applicable taxing authority to an earlier period. It is reasonably possible that in the next twelve months, because of changes in facts and circumstances, the unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease.\nThe Company estimates a possible decrease of approximately  $\n5\nmillion to $\n10\nmillion within the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and audit resolutions.\nThe Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties associated with the underpayment of income taxes within Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company recognized expense (benefit), before federal tax impact, related to interest and penalties of  $\n1.2\nmillion in 2023, $(\n1.0\n) million in 2022 and $\n0.3\nmillion in 2021. The Company had $\n7.9\nmillion and $\n6.7\nmillion accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe consolidated effective income tax rate varied from the United States federal statutory income tax rate of continuing operations for the years ended December 31, as follows:\nNOTE 15\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measurement\nFinancial Instruments\nConcentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of trade receivables, cash equivalents and investments. The Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business to its customers. Due to the diversity of its product lines, the Company has an extensive customer base including electrical distributors and wholesalers, electric utilities, equipment manufacturers, electrical contractors, telecommunication companies and retail and hardware outlets. We are not dependent on a single customer, however, the Company’s top ten customers account for approximately\n42\n%\nof its Net sales. As part of its ongoing procedures, the Company monitors the credit worthiness of its customers. Bad debt write-offs have historically been minimal. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and limits the amount of exposure in any one institution.\nAt December 31, 2023 our accounts receivable balance was $\n785.4\nmillion, net of allowances of $\n11.6\nmillion. The allowance for doubtful accounts has not materially changed since December 31, 2022.\nFair Value: The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, bank borrowings, accounts payable and accruals approximate their fair values given the immediate or short-term nature of these items. See also Note 8 — Investments.\nFair value measurements\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022 the Company had $\n88.4\nmillion and $\n80.2\nmillion respectively, of investments carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The FASB fair value measurement guidance established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. Refer to Note 8 — Investments for more information about these investments.\nThe three broad levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1 -\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 -\nQuoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly\nLevel 3 -\nUnobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring a company to develop its own assumptions\nThe following tables show, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\n(a)\nMoney market funds and time deposits are included in Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b)\nForward exchange contracts-Assets are reflected in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(c)\nForward exchange contracts-(Liabilities) are reflected in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe methods and assumptions used to estimate the Level 2 fair values were as follows:\nForward exchange contracts – The fair value of forward exchange contracts were based on quoted forward foreign exchange prices at the reporting date.\nAvailable-for-sale municipal bonds classified in Level 2 – The fair value of available-for-sale investments in municipal bonds is based on observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nDeferred compensation plan\nThe Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in non-qualified deferred compensation plans. A participant’s deferrals are invested in a variety of participant-directed debt and equity mutual funds that are classified as trading securities. During 2023 and 2022, the Company purchased $\n3.7\nmillion and $\n2.2\nmillion, respectively, of trading securities related to these deferred compensation plans. As a result of participant distributions, the Company sold $\n2.2\nmillion and $\n4.2\nmillion of these trading securities in 2023 and 2022 respectively. The unrealized gains and losses associated with these trading securities are directly offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying deferred compensation plan obligation.\nLong-term Debt\nThe total carrying value of long-term debt including the $\n15.0\nmillion current portion of the Term Loan as of December 31, 2023 was $\n2,038.2\nmillion, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs.  As of December 31, 2022 the carrying value of long-term debt was $\n1,437.9\nmillion, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance cost. The estimated fair value of the long-term debt as of December 31, 2023 and  December 31, 2022 was $\n1,951.6\nmillion and $\n1,306.5\nmillion, respectively, using quoted market prices in active markets for similar liabilities (Level 2)\n.\nNOTE 16\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLegal and Environmental\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business. These proceedings include claims for damages arising out of use of the Company’s products, intellectual property, workers’ compensation and environmental matters. The Company is self-insured up to specified limits for certain types of claims, including product liability and workers’ compensation, and is fully self-insured for certain other types of claims, including environmental and intellectual property matters. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that in management’s judgment is probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. We continually reassess the likelihood of adverse judgments and outcomes in these matters, as well as estimated ranges of possible losses based upon an analysis of each matter which includes advice of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations which may require that it investigate and remediate the effects of potential contamination associated with past and present operations as well as those acquired through business combinations. Environmental liabilities are recorded when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The Company continues to monitor these environmental matters and revalues its liabilities as necessary. Total\nenvironmental liabilities\nwere $\n6.7\nmillion and $\n6.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company accounts for conditional asset retirement and environmental obligations in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The accounting guidance defines “conditional asset retirement obligation” as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the Company. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Asset retirement obligations were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNOTE 17\nCapital Stock\nActivity in the Company’s common shares outstanding is set forth below for the three years ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nFor accounting purposes, the Company treats repurchased shares as constructively retired when acquired and accordingly   charges the purchase price against Common Stock par value, Additional paid-in capital and Retained earnings to the extent required. Shares may be repurchased through the Company’s stock repurchase program, acquired by the Company from employees or surrendered to the Company by employees in settlement of their minimum tax liability on vesting of restricted shares and performance shares under the Hubbell Incorporated 2005 Incentive Award Plan as amended and restated (the “Award Plan”).\nShares of the Company’s common stock were reserved at December 31, 2023 as follows (in thousands):\nNOTE 18\nStock-Based Compensation\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had various stock-based awards outstanding which were issued to executives and other key employees. The Company recognizes the grant-date fair value of all stock-based awards to employees over their respective requisite service periods (generally equal to an award’s vesting period), net of estimated forfeitures. A stock-based award is considered vested for expense attribution purposes when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. For those awards that vest immediately upon retirement eligibility, the Company recognizes compensation cost immediately for retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.\nThe Company’s long-term incentive program for awarding stock-based compensation includes a combination of restricted stock, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), and performance shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Award Plan. Under the Award Plan, the Company may authorize up to\n9.7\nmillion shares of common stock to settle awards of restricted stock, performance shares, or SARs. The Company issues new shares to settle stock-based awards. In 2023, the Company's grant of stock-based awards included restricted stock, SARs and performance shares.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized by the Company was $\n26.5\nmillion in 2023, $\n24.5\nmillion in 2022 and $\n17.5\nmillion in 2021. The total income tax benefit recognized was $\n4.0\nmillion in 2023, $\n3.9\nmillion in 2022, and $\n3.2\nmillion in 2021. The net tax windfall recorded as a result of exercise or vesting (depending on the type of award) was $\n6.4\nmillion, $\n3.2\nmillion, and $\n6.8\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was $\n19.7\nmillion, pretax, of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be primarily recognized through 2026.\nStock-based compensation expense is recorded in S&A expense as well as Cost of goods sold. Of the total 2023 expense, $\n24.9\nmillion was recorded to S&A expense and $\n1.6\nmillion was recorded to Cost of goods sold. In 2022 and 2021, $\n23.2\nmillion and $\n15.8\nmillion, respectively, was recorded to S&A expense and $\n1.3\nmillion and $\n1.7\nmillion, respectively, was recorded to Cost of goods sold. Stock-based compensation costs capitalized to inventory was $\n0.7\nmillion in 2023, $\n0.4\nmillion in 2022 and $\n0.4\nmillion in 2021.\nEach of the compensation arrangements is discussed below.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company issues various types of restricted stock awards all of which are considered outstanding at the time of grant, as the award holders are entitled to dividends and voting rights. Unvested restricted stock awards are considered participating securities when computing earnings per share. Restricted stock grants are not transferable and are subject to forfeiture in the event of the recipient’s termination of employment prior to vesting.\nRestricted Stock Issued to Employees - Service Condition\nRestricted stock awards that vest based upon a service condition are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. These awards generally\nvest either in\nthree\nequal installments on each of the first\nthree\nanniversaries of the grant date or on the third year anniversary of the grant date. The f\nair value of these awards is measured by the average of the high and low trading prices of the Company’s common stock on the most recent trading day immediately preceding the grant date (“measurement date”).\nRestricted Stock Issued to Non-employee Directors\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, each non-employee director received a restricted stock grant. These grants are made on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders and vest at the following year’s annual meeting of shareholders, or upon certain other events. The grant is subject to forfeiture if the director’s service terminates prior to the date of the next regularly scheduled annual meeting of shareholders. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted\n4,655\nshares,\n5,952\nshares, and\n6,741\nshares, respectively, to non-employee directors.\nRestricted Stock Issued to Employees and Non-employee Directors\nActivity related to both employee and non-employee restricted stock for the year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThe weighted average fair value per share of restricted stock granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n249.36\n, $\n187.07\nand $\n166.46\n, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock vested in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n9.7\nmillion, $\n8.4\nmillion and $\n12.6\nmillion, respectively.\nStock Appreciation Rights\nSARs grant the holder the right to receive, once vested, the value in shares of the Company's common stock equal to the positive difference between the grant price, as determined using the mean of the high and low trading prices of the Company’s common stock on the measurement date, and the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise. This amount is payable in shares of the Company’s common stock. SARs vest and become exercisable in\nthree\nequal installments during the first\nthree years\nfollowing the grant date and expire\nten years\nfrom the grant date.\nActivity related to SARs for the year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThe aggregated intrinsic value of SARs exercised during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n36.6\nmillion, $\n21.0\nmillion and $\n46.8\nmillion, respectively.\nThe fair value of each SAR award was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the SARs granted during the years 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nThe expected dividend yield was calculated by dividing the Company’s expected annual dividend by the average stock price for the past three months. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company’s stock for a period consistent with the expected term. The expected term of SARs granted was based upon historical exercise behavior of SARs. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the award.\nPerformance Shares\nPerformance shares represent the right to receive a share of the Company’s common stock subject to the achievement of certain market or performance conditions established by the Company’s Compensation Committee and measured over a\nthree year\nperiod. Partial vesting in these awards may occur after separation from the Company for retirement eligible employees. Shares are not vested until approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee.\nPerformance Shares - Performance and Market Conditions\nIn February 2020, the Company granted performance share awards with a target payout of\n63,868\nshares that would vest subject to a performance condition and service requirement. The number of shares vested is then modified by a market condition as described below.\nThirty-four\npercent of the award granted would vest based on the Company's compounded annual growth rate of Net sales as compared to that of the companies that comprise the S&P Capital Goods 900 index.\nThirty-three\npercent of the award granted would vest based on achieved operating margin performance as compared to internal targets, and\nthirty-three\npercent of the award granted would vest based on achieved trade working capital as a percent of Net sales as compared to internal targets. Each of these performance conditions is measured over the same\nthree-year\nperformance period. The cumulative result of these performance conditions would result in a number of shares earned in the range of\n0\n% -\n200\n% of the target number of shares subject to the award. That cumulative performance achieved is then further modified based on the Company's\nthree year\nTSR relative to the companies that constitute the S&P Capital Goods 900 index, to potentially increase or reduce the shares earned by a multiple of up to\n1.5\nor\n1.2\n, depending on the award year.  The fair value of the award was determined based upon a lattice model. The Company expensed these awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period which included an assessment of the performance achieved to date at each reporting period. The weighted average fair value per share was $\n151.78\nfor the awards granted in 2020.  During 2023, approximately\n79,000\nshares from the 2020 awards vested as a result of the cumulative achievement of the performance metrics, and the fair value of the awards at vesting was approximately $\n20.1\nmillion.\nPerformance Shares - Market Condition\nIn February 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company granted performance share awards with a target payout of\n11,481\n,\n14,076\nand\n15,741\nshares, respectively, that will vest subject to a market condition and service condition through the performance period. The market condition associated with the awards is the Company's total shareholder return (\"TSR\") compared to the TSR generated by the companies that comprise the S&P Capital Goods 900 index over a\nthree-year\nperformance period. Performance at target will result in vesting and issuance of the number of performance shares subject to the award, equal to\n100\n% payout. Performance below or above target can result in issuance in the range of\n0\n%-\n200\n% of the number of shares subject to the award. Expense is recognized irrespective of the market condition being achieved.\nThe fair value of the performance share awards with a market condition for these grants was determined based upon a lattice model.\nThe following table summarizes the related assumptions used to determine the fair values of the performance share awards with a market condition granted during February 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nExpected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company's and members of the peer group's stock over the expected term of the award. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for the expected term of the award.\nPerformance Shares - Performance Condition\nIn February 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company granted performance share awards with a target payout of\n23,316\n,\n28,628\nand\n31,543\nshares, respectively, that will vest subject to an internal Company-based performance condition and service requirement.\nFifty\npercent of these performance shares subject to the award will vest based on the Company's compounded annual growth rate of Net sales as compared to that of the companies that comprise the S&P Capital Goods 900 index.\nFifty\npercent of these performance shares subject to the award will vest based on achieved operating profit margin performance as compared to internal targets. Each of these performance conditions is measured over the same\nthree-year\nperformance period. The cumulative result of these performance conditions can result in a number of shares earned in the range of\n0\n%-\n200\n% of the target number of shares subject to the award.\nThe fair value of the award is measured based upon the average of the high and low trading prices of the Company's common stock on the measurement date reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid during the requisite service period.\nThe Company expenses these awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and including an assessment of the performance achieved to date. The weighted average fair value per share was $\n230.64\n, $\n174.48\nand $\n151.92\nfor the awards granted in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nNOTE 19\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company computes earnings per share using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and participating securities. Restricted stock granted by the Company is considered a participating security since it contains a non-forfeitable right to dividends.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of earnings per share for the three years ended December 31 (in millions, except per share amounts):\nThe Company did not have any material anti-dilutive securities in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nNOTE 20\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nA summary of the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive loss (net of tax) for the three years ended December 31, 2023 is provided below (in millions):\nA summary of the gain (loss) reclassifications out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss for the two years ended December 31 is provided below (in millions):\n(a)\nThese accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost (see Note 12 — Retirement Benefits for additional details).\nNOTE 21\nIndustry Segments and Geographic Area Information\nNature of Operations\nThe Company is a global manufacturer of quality electrical products and utility solutions for a broad range of customer and end-market applications.

We also offer a variety of lighting fixtures, wiring devices and electrical products that have residential and utility applications, including residential products with IoT enabled technologies.\nThese products are sold under various brands and/or trademarks and are primarily sold through electrical and industrial distributors, home centers, retail and hardware outlets, lighting showrooms and residential product oriented internet sites. Special application products are primarily sold through wholesale distributors to contractors, industrial customers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”).\nFinancial Information\nFinancial information by industry segment, product class and geographic area for each of the three years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is summarized below (in millions). When reading the data the following items should be noted:\n•\nNet sales comprise sales to unaffiliated customers — inter-segment and inter-area sales are not significant.\n•\nSegment operating income consists of Net sales less operating expenses, including total corporate expenses, which are generally allocated to each segment on the basis of the segment’s percentage of consolidated Net sales. Interest expense and investment income and other expense, net have not been allocated to segments as these items are centrally managed by the Company.\n•\nGeneral corporate assets not allocated to segments are principally cash, prepaid pensions, investments and deferred taxes. These assets have not been allocated as they are centrally managed by the Company.\nINDUSTRY SEGMENT DATA\nGEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA\n(1)\nTotal Assets and Long-lived assets attributable to the Company's formerly owned Commercial and Industrial Lighting business, totaling $\n356.6\nmillion and $\n177.1\nmillion were included in total assets held for sale, and noncurrent portion respectively as of December 31, 2021 on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 2, Discontinued Operations, for further information on the Company's sale of the C&I Lighting business.\nOn a geographic basis, the Company defines “international” as operations based outside of the United States and its possessions. As a percentage of total Net sales, shipments from foreign operations directly to third parties were\n8\n% in 2023,\n8\n% in 2022 and\n9\n% in 2021, with the UK, Canadian, and Brazilian operations representing approximately\n32\n%,\n29\n%, and\n15\n%  respectively, of 2023 total international Net sales.\nLong-lived assets, excluding deferred tax assets, of international subsidiaries were\n10\n% of the consolidated total in 2023,\n12\n% in 2022 and\n11\n% in 2021, with the Brazil, UK, and Spain operations representing approximately\n21\n%,\n19\n%, and\n14\n%, respectively, of the international total in 2023. Export sales from United States operations wer\ne $\n345.6\nmillion i\nn 2023, $\n253.0\nmillion in 2022 and $\n227.0\nmillion in 2021.\nNOTE 22\nGuarantees\nThe Company records a liability equal to the fair value of guarantees in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with the accounting guidance for guarantees. When it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues for costs associated with guarantees. The most likely costs to be incurred are accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts and, where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the fair value and maximum potential payment related to the Company’s guarantees were not material.\nThe Company offers product warranties which cover defects on most of its products. These warranties primarily apply to products that are properly installed, maintained and used for their intended purposes. The Company accrues estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. Estimated warranty expenses, recorded in cost of goods sold, are based upon historical information such as past experience, product failure rates, or the estimated number of units to be repaired or replaced. Adjustments are made to the product warranty accrual as claims are incurred, additional information becomes known or as historical experience indicates.\nChanges in the accrual for product warranties for the two years ended December 31 are set forth below (in millions):\n(a)\nRefer to Note 10\n–\nOther Accrued Liabilities and Note 11\n–\nOther Non-Current Liabilities for a breakout of short-term and long-term warranties.\nNOTE 23\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring 2023, we incurred costs for restructuring actions initiated in 2023 as well as costs relating to restructuring actions initiated in the prior year. Our restructuring actions are associated with cost reduction efforts that include the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities, as well as, workforce reductions and the sale or exit of business units we determine to be non-strategic. Restructuring costs are primarily severance and employee benefits, asset impairments, as well as facility closure, contract termination and certain pension costs that are directly related to restructuring actions. These costs are predominantly settled in cash from our operating activities and are generally settled within one year, with the exception of asset impairments, which are non-cash.\nPre-tax restructuring costs incurred in each of our segments and the location of the costs in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows (in millions):\nThe following table summarizes the accrued liabilities for our restructuring actions (in millions):\nThe actual and expected pre-tax costs for our restructuring actions are as follows (in millions):\nNOTE 24\nLeases\nOur operating leases primarily consist of office space, certain manufacturing facilities, and vehicles. Our finance leases are not material. The term of our operating leases is generally\n10\nyears or less, in some cases, with options to extend the term for up to\n5\nyears, or options to terminate after\none year\nwithout penalty. In general, our vehicle lease payments contain a monthly base rent payment which is adjusted based on changes to the LIBOR rate over the lease term. Certain other lease agreements contain variable payments related to a consumer price index or similar metric. Any change in payment amounts as a result of a change in a rate or index are considered variable lease payments and recognized as profit or loss when incurred.\nRent expense for operating leases in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2023,  December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021 were $\n37.7\nmillion, $\n35.7\nmillion, and $\n34.1\nmillion, respectively.

Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures will meet their objectives.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company acquired Northern Star Holdings, Indústria Electromecânica Balestro Ltda. and El Electronics LLC  Inc, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion. Because the Company has not yet fully incorporated the internal controls and procedures of the acquired entities into the Company's internal control over financial reporting, management excluded these business from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. These entities accounted for 4% of the Company's total assets excluding intangibles and goodwill as of December 31, 2023 and 1% of the Company's net sales for the year then ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, each of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level. Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting and the independent registered public accounting firm’s audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 are included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are incorporated herein by reference.\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting."
