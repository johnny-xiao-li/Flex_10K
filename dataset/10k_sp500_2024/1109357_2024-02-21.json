    "text": "Each of the Registrants operates in a complex market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond that Registrant’s direct control. Such risks, which could negatively affect one or more\n20\nof the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements, are captured below. Although the risks are generally organized by category and separately described, many of these risks are interrelated. Additionally, the risks should be considered holistically with other information included in this filing and future filings with the SEC.\nRisks related to market and financial factors\nprimarily include:\n•\nthe demand for electricity, reliability of service, and affordability in the markets where the Utility Registrants conduct their business,\n•\nthe ability of the Utility Registrants to operate their respective transmission and distribution assets, their ability to access capital markets, and the impacts on their results of operations, financial condition or liquidity/cash flows due to public health crises, epidemics or pandemics, and\n•\nemerging technologies and business models, including those related to climate change mitigation and transition to a low carbon economy.\nRisks related to legislative, regulatory, and legal factors\nprimarily include changes to, and compliance with, the laws and regulations that govern:\n•\nutility regulatory business models,\n•\nenergy, environmental, and climate policy, and\n•\ntax policy.\nRisks related to operational factors\nprimarily include:\n•\nchanges in the global climate could produce extreme weather events, which could put the Registrant’s facilities at risk, and such changes could also affect the levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services,\n•\nthe ability of the Utility Registrants to maintain the reliability, resiliency, and safety of their energy delivery systems, which could affect their ability to deliver energy to their customers and affect their operating costs, and\n•\nphysical and cyber security risks for the Utility Registrants as the owner-operators of transmission and distribution facilities.\nRisks related to the separation\nprimarily\ninclude:\n•\nchallenges to achieving the benefits of separation and\n•\nperformance by Exelon and Constellation under the transaction agreements, including indemnification responsibilities.\nThere may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that could negatively affect the Registrants' consolidated financial statements in the future.\nRisks Related to Market and Financial Factors\nThe Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry (All Registrants).\nAdvancements in power generation technology, including commercial and residential solar generation installations and commercial micro turbine installations, are improving the cost-effectiveness of customer self-supply of electricity. Improvements in energy storage technology, including batteries and fuel cells, could also better position customers to meet their around-the-clock electricity requirements. Improvements in energy efficiency of lighting, appliances, equipment and building materials will also affect energy consumption by customers. Changes in power generation, storage, and use technologies could have significant effects on customer behaviors and their energy consumption.\n21\nThese developments could affect levels of customer-owned generation, customer expectations, and current business models and make portions of the Utility Registrants' transmission and/or distribution facilities uneconomic prior to the end of their useful lives. Increasing pressure from both the private and public sectors to take actions to mitigate climate change could also push the speed and nature of this transition. These factors could affect the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements through, among other things, increased Operating and maintenance expenses, increased capital expenditures, and potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation over shortened remaining asset useful lives.\nMarket performance and other factors could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant additional funding (All Registrants).\nDisruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investments held within Exelon’s employee benefit plan trusts. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below Exelon's projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and OPEB plan assets would increase the funding requirements associated with Exelon’s pension and OPEB plan obligations. Additionally, Exelon’s pension and OPEB plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to Social Security or Medicare eligibility requirements could also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and OPEB plans. See Note 14\n—\nRetirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by unstable capital and credit markets (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the United States or abroad could negatively affect the Registrants’ ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. The inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets because of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, or require a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. In addition, the Registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets, including Europe, Canada, and Asia. Disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants’ ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 23%, 10%, and 16% of the Registrants’ available credit facilities were with European, Canadian, and Asian banks, respectively. Additionally, higher interest rates may put pressure on the Registrants’ overall liquidity profile, financial health and impact financial results. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit facilities.\nIf any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in its agreements with its counterparties or regulatory financial requirements, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral that could affect its liquidity and could experience higher borrowing costs (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants' operating agreements with PJM and PECO's, BGE's, and DPL's natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected by their credit rating and market prices. If certain wholesale market conditions were to exist and the Utility Registrants were to lose their investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon their remaining sources of liquidity. PJM collateral posting requirements will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. Collateral posting requirements for PECO, BGE, and DPL, with respect to their natural gas supply contracts, will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. If the Utility\n22\nRegistrants were downgraded, they could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade.  In addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have an adverse negative impact on the ratings of the Utility Registrants.\nThe Utility Registrants conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other arrangements and procedures intended to assure that the Utility Registrants are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate the Utility Registrants from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulty at Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as “ring-fencing”) could help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants in the event of a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon. Despite these ring-fencing measures, the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon could result in a reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the Utility Registrants. A reduction in the credit rating of a Utility Registrant could have a material adverse effect on the Utility Registrant.\nSee ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Credit Matters and Cash Requirements — Security Ratings for additional information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on the Registrants’ cash flows.\nThe impacts of significant economic downturns or increases in customer rates, could lead to decreased volumes delivered and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances (All Registrants).\nThe impacts of significant economic downturns on the Utility Registrants' customers and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations for the Utility Registrants, could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances and related expense. Further, increases in customer rates, including those related to increases in Purchased power and natural gas prices, could result in declines in customer usage and lower revenues for the Utility Registrants that do not have decoupling mechanisms.\nSee ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for additional information on the Registrants’ credit risk.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by the impacts of weather (All Registrants).\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting operating revenues at PECO and DPL Delaware. Due to revenue decoupling, operating revenues from electric distribution at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE and gas distribution at BGE are not affected by abnormal weather.\nExtreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms could stress the Utility Registrants' transmission and distribution systems, communication systems, and technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each Utility Registrant's ability to meet peak customer demand. First and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and could make period comparisons less relevant.\nClimate change projections suggest increases to summer temperature and humidity trends, as well as more erratic precipitation and storm patterns over the long-term in the areas where the Utility Registrants have transmission and distribution assets. The frequency in which weather conditions emerge outside the current expected climate norms could contribute to weather-related impacts discussed above.\nLong-lived assets, goodwill, and other assets could become impaired (All Registrants).\nLong-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the Registrants’ statements of financial position. In addition, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI have material goodwill balances.\n23\nThe Registrants evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. Factors such as, but not limited to, the business climate, including current and future energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered.\nComEd and PHI perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. Regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions, including discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd’s, Pepco’s, DPL’s, and ACE’s business, and the fair value of debt, could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon’s, ComEd's, and PHI’s goodwill.\nAn impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset or goodwill to fair value through a non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Note 7 — Property, Plant, and Equipment, Note 11 — Asset Impairments, and Note 12 — Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on long-lived asset impairments and goodwill impairments.\nThe Registrants could incur substantial costs in the event of non-performance by third-parties under indemnification agreements, or when the Registrants have guaranteed their performance (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a Registrant and hold it harmless against specified obligations and claims. To the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the affected Registrant could be held responsible for the obligations. Each of the Utility Registrants has transferred its former generation assets to one or more third parties and in each case the transferee has agreed to assume certain obligations and to indemnify the applicable Utility Registrant for such obligations. In connection with the restructurings under which ComEd, PECO, and BGE transferred their generating assets to Constellation, Constellation assumed certain of ComEd’s, PECO’s, and BGE's rights and obligations with respect to their former generation assets. Further, ComEd, PECO, and BGE have entered into agreements with third parties under which the third-party agreed to indemnify ComEd, PECO, or BGE for certain obligations related to their respective former generation assets that have been assumed by Constellation as part of the restructuring. If Constellation or a transferee of one of the Utility Registrant’s generation assets experienced events that reduced its creditworthiness or the indemnity arrangement became unenforceable, the applicable Utility Registrant could be liable for any existing or future claims. In addition, the Utility Registrants have residual liability under certain laws in connection with their former generation assets.\nThe Registrants have issued indemnities to third parties regarding environmental or other matters in connection with purchases and sales of assets, including several of the Utility Registrants in connection with Constellation's absorption of their former generating assets. The Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations under these indemnities.\nThe Registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third parties, which obligate the Registrants to perform if the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by those third parties, the Registrants could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees.\nRisks Related to Legislative, Regulatory, and Legal Factors\nThe Registrants' businesses are highly regulated and electric and gas revenue and earnings could be negatively affected by legislative and/or regulatory actions (All Registrants).\nSubstantial aspects of the Registrants' businesses are subject to comprehensive Federal or state legislation and/or regulation.\nThe Utility Registrants' consolidated financial statements are heavily dependent on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs for the retail purchase, transmission, and distribution of power and natural gas to their customers.\n24\nFundamental changes in laws or regulations or adverse legislative or regulatory actions affecting the Registrants’ businesses would require changes in their business planning models and operations. Registrants cannot always predict when or whether legislative or regulatory action will occur and may not be able to influence the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives.\nChanges in the Utility Registrants' respective terms and conditions of service, including their respective rates, along with adoption of new rate structures and constructs, or establishment of new rate cases, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy, and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result, and which could result in uncertainties in rate case outcomes, and/or introduce time delays in effectuating rate changes (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services, adoption of new rate structures and constructs or establishment of new rate cases. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for a Utility Registrant to recover its costs once the rates become effective. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, credit losses, MGP remediation, smart grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants could agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives, or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval.  The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs or earn an adequate return.\nIn addition to potential timing delays, the Registrants also face other uncertainties in rate proceedings that could impact recovery, including not obtaining anticipated allowed rates of return, allowed capital structures, or allowed return on pension assets, and various other factors.\nSee Note 3\n—\nRegulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards, including the likely exposure of the Utility Registrants to the results of PJM’s RTEP and NERC compliance requirements (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants as users, owners, and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability standards could subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. In addition, the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DEPSC, and NJBPU impose certain distribution reliability standards on the Utility Registrants. If the Utility Registrants were found in non-compliance with the Federal or state mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary penalties.\nThe Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state, and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the way the Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures, including how they handle air and water emissions, hazardous and solid waste, and activities affecting surface waters, groundwater, and aquatic and other species. Violations of these requirements could subject the Registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties and exposure to third parties’ claims\n25\nfor alleged health or property damages, or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generated or released. Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by predecessor companies are one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved in several proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and could be subject to additional proceedings in the future. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS — Environmental Matters and Regulation for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by federal and state RPS and/or energy conservation legislation, along with energy conservation by customers (All Registrants).\nChanges to current state legislation or the development of Federal legislation that requires the use of low-emission, renewable, and/or alternate fuel sources could significantly impact the Utility Registrants, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed.\nFederal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart meters and smart grid, could increase capital expenditures and could significantly impact the Utility Registrants' consolidated financial statements if timely cost recovery is not allowed. These energy conservation programs, regulated energy consumption reduction targets, and new  energy consumption technologies could cause declines in customer energy consumption and lead to a decline in the Registrants' earnings, if timely recovery is not allowed. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS — Environmental Matters and Regulation — Renewable and Clean Energy Standards and \"The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry\" above for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by challenges to tax positions taken, tax law changes, and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions. (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are required to make judgments to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities, which includes general tax positions taken and associated reserves established. Tax obligations include, but are not limited to: income, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeal issues related to these tax matters. All tax estimates could be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. Additionally, earnings may be impacted due to changes in federal or local/state tax laws, and the inherent difficulty of estimating potential tax effects of ongoing business decisions. See Note 1\n—\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Note 13\n—\nIncome Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLegal proceedings could result in a negative outcome, which the Registrants cannot predict (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising out of their business operations. The material ones are summarized in Note 18\n—\nCommitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenue, or restrict or disrupt business activities.\nThe Registrants could be subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other consequences (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants could be the subject of public criticism. Adverse publicity could render public service commissions and other regulatory and legislative authorities less likely to view energy companies generally, or the Registrants specifically, in a favorable light, and could cause the Registrants to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements.\nThe activities associated with the past Deferred Prosecution Agreement and the now resolved associated SEC investigation could have a material adverse effect on Exelon’s and ComEd’s\n26\nreputation and relationship with legislators, regulators, and customers that could affect their ability to achieve actions and approvals (Exelon and ComEd).\nOn July 17, 2020, ComEd entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the USAO for the Northern District of Illinois to resolve the USAO’s investigation into Exelon’s and ComEd’s lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. Exelon was not made a party to the DPA and no charges were brought against Exelon. Under the DPA, the USAO filed a single charge alleging that ComEd improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Speaker’s associates, with the intent to influence the Speaker’s action regarding legislation affecting ComEd’s interests. The DPA provided that the USAO would defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against ComEd in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period. That period expired, and the pending charge was dismissed, in July 2023. In October 2019, the SEC notified Exelon and ComEd that it had opened an investigation into their lobbying activities in the state of Illinois. On September 28, 2023, Exelon and ComEd reached a settlement with the SEC to fully resolve the matter.\nThe DPA and the settlement with the SEC could have a material adverse impact on Exelon’s and ComEd’s reputation or relationships with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers, and other stakeholders. Those impacts could affect, or make more difficult, their efforts to achieve actions or approvals associated with operations. See Note 18\n—\nCommitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the DPA and SEC settlement.\nRisks Related to Operational Factors\nThe Registrants are subject to risks associated with climate change (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants periodically perform analyses to better understand long-term projections of climate change and how those changes in the physical environments where they operate could affect their facilities and operations. The Registrants primarily operate in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic of the United States, areas that historically have been prone to various types of severe weather events, and the Registrants have well-developed response and recovery programs based on these historical events. However, the Registrants’ physical facilities could be at greater risk of damage as changes in the global climate affect temperature and weather patterns, including if such climate changes result in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, elevated levels of precipitation, sea level rise, increased surface water temperatures, wildfires and/or other effects. Over time, the Registrants are making additional investments to protect their facilities from physical climate-related risks.\nIn addition, changes to the climate may impact levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services, which could affect Registrants’ operations and business. Over time, the Registrants are making additional investments to adapt to changes in operational requirements to manage demand changes and customer expectations caused by climate change.\nClimate Change risks include changes to energy systems due to new technologies, changing customer expectations and/or voluntary GHG goals, as well as local, state, or federal regulatory requirements intended to reduce GHG emissions, including through limitation of the use of natural gas. The Registrants also periodically perform analyses of potential energy system transition pathways to reduce economy-wide GHG emissions to mitigate climate change. To the extent additional GHG reduction legislation and/or regulation becomes effective at the Federal and/or state levels, the Registrants could incur costs to further limit the GHG emissions from their operations or otherwise comply with applicable requirements and such legislation and/or regulation could otherwise adversely affect the Registrants' businesses. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS — Environmental Matters and Regulation — Climate Change and ITEM 1.A. \"The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry\" above for additional information.\nThe Utility Registrants' operating costs are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems (All Registrants).\nFailures of the equipment or facilities used in the Utility Registrants' delivery systems could interrupt electric transmission and/or electric or natural gas delivery, which could result in a loss of revenues and an increase in maintenance and capital expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can occur due to several factors, including natural causes such as weather or information systems failure. Specifically, if the implementation of AMI, smart\n27\ngrid, or other technologies in the Utility Registrants' service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information systems, or if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Utility Registrants' financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, dependence upon automated systems could further increase the risk that operational system flaws or internal and/or external tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nRegulated utilities, which are required to provide service to all customers within their respective service territories, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd could be required to pay damages to its customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, which could be material.\nThe Registrants are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risks (All Registrants).\nRisks from cybersecurity and physical threats to energy infrastructures are increasing. Threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state actors, continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric and natural gas utility industry, grid infrastructure, and other energy infrastructures, and attacks and disruptions, both physical, cyber, and hybrid targeting physical and cyber assets, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. Several U.S. government agencies have warned of increased risks related to physical attacks, ransomware attacks and cybersecurity threats related to the energy sector and its supply chains, and that the risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions.  Continued implementation of advanced digital technologies increases the potentially unfavorable impacts of such attacks. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify the Registrants' cybersecurity risks.\nA security breach of the Registrants' physical assets or information systems or those of the Registrants' competitors, vendors, business partners and interconnected entities (including RTOs and ISOs) could materially impact Registrants by, among other things, impairing the availability of electricity and gas distributed by Registrants and/or the reliability of transmission and distribution systems, damaging grid infrastructure, interrupting critical business functions, impairing the availability of vendor services and materials that the Registrants rely on to maintain their operations, or by leading to the theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including critical infrastructure information, system data and architecture, sensitive customer, vendor, or employee data, or other confidential data. The Registrants' reliance on vendors to provide services and equipment, and its shared information systems with Constellation pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement between Exelon and Constellation, increases the risk to assets, systems, and data.  While some of the Registrants' vendors have experienced cybersecurity incidents, such incidents have not, to Registrants' knowledge, resulted in material impact to any of the Registrants to date.  The risk of these events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify. The Registrants have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to physical and cyber-attacks. While to date none of the Registrants has directly experienced a material breach or material disruption to its network or information systems or operations, as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency, the Registrants may be subject to a material breach or material disruption in the future.\nIf a significant physical or cybersecurity breach or disruption were to occur, the Registrants' reputation could be negatively affected, customer confidence in the Registrants could be diminished and the Registrants could be subject to legal claims, regulatory exposure, loss of revenues, increased costs including for infrastructure repairs, or operations shutdown, all of which could materially affect the Registrants' financial condition and materially damage its business reputation. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such security breaches or disruptions may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result. The continued increase in Federal and state regulatory requirements related to cybersecurity and evolving threat actor-capabilities could require changes to current measures taken by the Registrants or to their business operations and could adversely affect their consolidated financial statements.\nThe Registrants’ employees, contractors, customers, and the general public could be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry (All Registrants).\nEmployees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and customers and the general public could be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near the Registrants’ operations. As a result, employees,\n28\ncontractors, customers, and the general public are at some risk for serious injury, including loss of life. These risks include gas explosions, pole strikes, and electric contact cases.\nExtreme weather events, natural disasters, operational accidents such as wildfires or natural gas explosions, war, acts and threats of terrorism, public health crises, epidemics,  pandemics, or other significant events could negatively impact the Registrants' results of operations, ability to raise capital and future growth (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants' infrastructures and/or operations could be affected by extreme weather events, natural disasters, or operational accidents such as wildfires or natural gas explosions which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs and third-party property damage. An extreme weather event, natural disaster, or operational accident within the Utility Registrants’ service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment.\nThe impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry and the Registrants is uncertain. The Registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign could affect Registrants' operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of supplies and markets. Furthermore, such events could compromise the physical or cybersecurity of the Registrants' facilities, which could adversely affect the Registrants' ability to manage their businesses effectively. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, public health crises, epidemics, pandemics, credit crises, recession, or other significant events also could result in a decline in energy consumption or interruption of fuel or the supply chain. In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.\nThe Registrants could be significantly affected by public health crises, epidemics, or pandemics. The Registrants have plans in place to respond to such events. However, depending on the severity and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, a public health crisis, epidemic, or pandemic could adversely affect our vendors, or customers and customer demand as well as the Registrants’ ability to operate their transmission and distribution assets.\nIn addition, on behalf of the Registrants Exelon maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property, casualty, and cybersecurity losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that could damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty losses.\nThe Registrants’ businesses are capital intensive, and their assets could require significant expenditures to maintain, are subject to operational failure and could be impacted by lack of availability of labor, materials or parts, which could result in potential liability (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants’ businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. Equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Utility Registrants’ control, and could require significant expenditures to operate efficiently. Disruptions or cost increases in the supply chain, including shortages in labor, materials or parts, could materially impact the timing and execution of capital projects, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The Registrants' consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital, or if they are deemed liable for operational failure. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding the Registrants’ potential future capital expenditures.\nThe Utility Registrants' respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs, and their capital expenditures could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion and failures of neighboring transmission systems (All Registrants).\nDemand for electricity within the Utility Registrants' service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage. Also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the Utility Registrants' ability to comply with reliability standards and\n29\nstrain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As is the case for electric utilities generally, potential concerns over transmission capacity or generation facility retirements could result in PJM or FERC requiring the Utility Registrants to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures.\nPJM’s systems and operations are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. However, service interruptions at other utilities may cause interruptions in the Utility Registrants’ service areas.\nThe Registrants' performance could be negatively affected if they fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce (All Registrants).\nCertain events, such as the separation transaction, an employee strike, loss of employees, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, could lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the Registrants. Such challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. As a result of such events, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, could rise. The Registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees needed to conduct Registrants' transmission and distribution operations as well as areas where new technologies are pertinent.\nThe Registrants’ performance could be negatively affected by poor performance of third-party contractors that perform periodic or ongoing work (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance, and construction work. Performance standards typically are included in all contractual obligations, but poor performance may impact capital execution plans or operations, or have adverse financial or reputational consequences.\nThe Registrants could make acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and new markets, which may not be successful or achieve the intended financial results (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants face risks associated with regulator-mandated or other new business initiatives, such as smart grids and broader beneficial electrification. Such risks include, but are not limited to, cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cybersecurity, and obsolescence of technology. Such initiatives may not be successful, and failures could result in adverse financial or reputational consequences.\nRisks Related to the Separation (Exelon)\nIn connection with the separation into two public companies, Exelon and Constellation have agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities. If Exelon is required to pay under these indemnities to Constellation, Exelon's financial results could be negatively impacted. The Constellation indemnities may not be sufficient to hold Exelon harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which Constellation has been allocated responsibility, and Constellation may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements between Exelon and Constellation, each party agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities, generally for uncapped amounts. Liabilities subject to Exelon’s indemnity obligations to Constellation generally are not subject to caps, may be significant and could negatively impact Exelon’s business. Any amounts Exelon is required to pay pursuant to these indemnity obligations could require Exelon to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of its operating business. Further, third parties could seek to hold Exelon responsible for any of the liabilities that Constellation has agreed to retain and for which Constellation is obligated to indemnify Exelon.  The indemnities from Constellation for Exelon's benefit may not be sufficient to protect Exelon against the full amount of such liabilities, and Constellation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Even if Exelon ultimately succeeds in recovering from Constellation any amounts for which Exelon is held liable, Exelon may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect Exelon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n30"

    "text": "Risk management and strategy\nCybersecurity risk for all Registrants is managed at the enterprise-level. Management of material risks from cybersecurity threats is integrated into the Registrants' overall risk management processes and is monitored as an enterprise risk. Exelon's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and cybersecurity management team regularly hold meetings with senior management of each Registrant, facilitated by Exelon’s enterprise risk management team, to discuss issues pertaining to cybersecurity risk management, including changes in the nature and origin of threats, threat actor and risk mitigation activities, and regulatory developments. Exelon Legal and compliance professionals engage with the CISO and cybersecurity management team to address tactical and strategic cybersecurity risks. Exelon monitors cybersecurity risks through key risk indicators to identify potential changes in risk exposure and provide the Board of Directors with information about the monitoring of key risks in connection with its oversight of the Registrants' enterprise risk management system.\nThe CISO, through Exelon’s Cyber Information and Security Services (CISS), reviews external and internal sources to obtain cyber threat intelligence to develop strategic and tactical threat assessments that inform the enterprise-wide cyber risk mitigation programs and actions. Exelon uses a wide range of tools, including endpoint, anomaly and network detection, logging and monitoring of security events, network segmentation, firewalls, hardening and securing devices, cyber vulnerability detection and patch management, cyber threat hunting, malware forensic analysis, industry-specific reports, and tabletop exercises to inform the cybersecurity management team. Exelon protects assets critical to grid reliability and national security through the implementation of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s Critical Infrastructure Protection requirements, and gas pipeline security under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Safety Administration’s Security Directives. Exelon maintains security relationships with law enforcement and U.S. intelligence agencies, coordinates with the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC) and participates in the Department of Energy’s Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP) to strengthen the security of the energy grid, develop and deploy new technologies, share information, design and participate in drills and exercises such as the bi-annual Grid Security Exercises and facilitate cross-sector coordination. Exelon applies stringent employee and contractor screening, and advances security awareness through training and monitoring programs that address both cyber and physical threats. Exelon employees are subject to annual mandatory training addressing security awareness, including cybersecurity and phishing.  Exelon maintains cyber insurance coverage at limits consistent with the utility industry and reviews policy coverage and limits on an annual basis.\nIn assessing the effectiveness of its cybersecurity risk management program, the CISO makes use of external perspectives from regulatory compliance audits and inspections, external audits of the Registrants' financial systems, and third-party incident response and detection analytics. Cybersecurity risks associated with the Registrants’ use of certain third-party service providers are evaluated and managed through CISS' Third Party Security team that leverages security risk assessments, contractual terms and conditions, and security awareness training for such providers. Additionally, those providers are required to report cybersecurity incidents, including the unauthorized use or disclosure of Registrants’ confidential information to Exelon’s security operations center.  Third Party Security investigates certain third-party cybersecurity events as part of Exelon’s incident response program.\nGovernance\nThe Exelon Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. As part of its responsibility and as documented in the 2022 Cybersecurity Oversight Policy, the Board of Directors oversees Exelon's cybersecurity program and Exelon’s enterprise-wide risk related to cybersecurity, including management’s identification, assessment, and mitigation of cybersecurity risks. At each regular quarterly meeting, the Board of Directors engages with the CISO and a cross-functional management team regarding the risks from cybersecurity threats. The CISO and professionals from the legal and compliance departments brief\n31\nthe Board of Directors on relevant topics, including information security and operational security, legislative and regulatory developments, and notable external cyber events relevant to Exelon and the industry more broadly. Management engages with the Board of Directors on risks from cybersecurity threats as appropriate outside of the quarterly meetings.\nThe CISO manages Exelon's enterprise-wide cybersecurity programs and reports to Exelon’s Chief Information Officer. The CISO has been responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats at Exelon since 2018 and was named to the current role in 2022. The CISO has 25 years of information technology and cybersecurity experience in the critical infrastructure sector, of which 23 years have been in the utility industry.  The CISO leads CISS, which manages centralized information technology and operational technology security programs for the Registrants. The programs are aligned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework (NIST CSF) and integrate cyber asset identification; threat assessment; risk assessment; risk management; and risk monitoring. CISS operates a security operations center for monitoring, identifying, and mitigating potential cybersecurity events or incidents.\nExelon maintains a single, centralized cybersecurity incident response program and plan that aligns with NIST CSF by integrating the identify, determine/classify, escalate and respond functions (which track the lifecycle of an event or incident). Security threats and incidents are identified and assessed to determine potential impact and escalated to senior cybersecurity management and the CISO. The CISO directs the security incident response team to contain, eradicate, and recover from an active threat. Exelon leverages the expertise of dedicated incident response vendors that can provide timely and specialized support to respond and recover from an event. The CISO and a cross-functional team convene as needed to evaluate cybersecurity events, including third-party events. The legal and compliance departments provide incident response support to the CISO, manage cybersecurity-related legal and compliance issues, and direct materiality evaluations using both qualitative and quantitative factors for each Registrant.\nAlthough the Registrants have not experienced any material cybersecurity events to date, cybersecurity threats could materially affect each Registrant’s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, as further discussed in the risk factor entitled “The Registrants are subject to physical and cybersecurity risks\" in ITEM 1A. of this report.\n32"

    "text": "(Dollars in millions except per share data, unless otherwise noted)\nExelon\nExecutive Overview\nExelon is a utility services holding company engaged in the energy transmission and distribution businesses through its six reportable segments: ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE. See Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 — Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Exelon's principal subsidiaries and reportable segments.\nExelon’s consolidated financial information includes the results of its seven separate operating subsidiary registrants, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE, which, along with Exelon, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. The following combined Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE. However, none of the Registrants makes any representation as to information related solely to any of the other Registrants. For discussion of the Utility Registrants' year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, refer to ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS in the 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 14, 2023.\nCOVID-19.\nThere were no material impacts to the Registrants from unfavorable economic conditions due to COVID-19 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, other than the 2022 impairment discussed below.\nThe Registrants assessed long-lived assets, goodwill, and investments for recoverability. Exelon and BGE recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $48 million in 2022 as a result of COVID-19 impacts on office use. See Note 11 — Asset Impairments for additional information related to this impairment assessment.\nFinancial Results of Operations\nGAAP Results of Operations.\nThe following table sets forth Exelon's GAAP consolidated Net income attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations by Registrant for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. For additional information regarding the financial results for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, see the discussions of Results of Operations by Registrant.\n__________\n(a)\nOther primarily includes eliminating and consolidating adjustments, Exelon’s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investing activities.\nThe separation of Constellation, including Generation and its subsidiaries, met the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, Generation's results of operations are presented as discontinued operations and have been excluded from Exelon's continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 presented in the table\n40\nabove. See Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 — Discontinued Operations for additional information.\nAccounting rules require certain BSC costs previously allocated to Generation to be presented as part of Exelon’s continuing operations as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations. Such costs are included in Other in the table above and were $28 million on a pre-tax basis, for the year ended December 31, 2022. There were no such costs included in Exelon's continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022.\nNet income attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations\nincreased by $274 million and Diluted earnings per average common share from continuing operations increased to $2.34 in 2023 from $2.08 in 2022 primarily due to:\n•\nHigher electric distribution and transmission earnings from higher allowed ROE due to an increase in treasury rates and higher rate base at ComEd;\n•\nFavorable impacts of rate increases at PECO, BGE, and PHI;\n•\nFavorable impacts of the multi-year plans including the recognition of the reconciliation in 2023 at BGE;\n•\nHigher carrying costs related to the CMC regulatory assets at ComEd; and\n•\nLower BSC costs presented in Exelon’s continuing operations, which were previously allocated to Generation but do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operation per the accounting rules.\nThe increases were partially offset by:\n•\nHigher interest expense at PECO, BGE, PHI, and Exelon Corporate;\n•\nUnfavorable weather at PECO and PHI;\n•\nHigher depreciation expense at PECO, BGE, and PHI;\n•\nHigher contracting costs at PHI;\n•\nHigher storm costs at PECO and BGE; and\n•\nHigher realized losses from hedging activity at Exelon Corporate.\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings.\nIn addition to Net income, Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of year-over-year operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items not considered by management to be directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.\n41\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between Net income attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022:\n__________\nNote:\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\nUnless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP Net income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. The marginal statutory income tax rates for 2023 and 2022 ranged from 24.0% to 29.0%.\n(a)\nReflects costs related to a multi-year ERP system implementation, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense.\n(b)\nReflects costs related to the impairment of an office building at BGE, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense.\n(c)\nRepresents costs related to the separation primarily comprised of system-related costs, third-party costs paid to advisors, consultants, lawyers, and other experts assisting in the separation, and employee-related severance costs, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense and Other, net.\n(d)\nIn 2022, for PECO, primarily reflects an adjustment to exclude one-time non-cash impacts associated with the remeasurement of deferred income taxes as a result of the reduction in Pennsylvania corporate income tax rate. For Corporate, in connection with the separation, Exelon recorded an income tax expense primarily due to the long-term marginal state income tax rate change, the recognition of valuation allowances against the net deferred tax assets positions for certain standalone state filing jurisdictions, and nondeductible transaction costs partially offset by a one-time impact associated with a state tax benefit. In 2023, reflects the adjustment to state deferred income taxes due to changes in forecasted apportionment.\nSignificant 2023 Transactions and Developments\nSeparation\nOn February 21, 2021, Exelon’s Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Utility Registrants and Generation, creating two publicly traded companies (“the separation”). Exelon completed the separation on February 1, 2022. Constellation was newly formed and incorporated in Pennsylvania on June 15, 2021 for the purpose of separation and holds Generation. The separation represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on Exelon’s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the separation meets the criteria for discontinued operations. See Note 2 — Discontinued Operations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the separation and discontinued operations.\n42\nIn connection with the separation, Exelon incurred separation costs impacting continuing operations of $29 million and $34 million on a pre-tax basis for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense. These costs are excluded from Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. The separation costs are primarily comprised of system-related costs, third-party costs paid to advisors, consultants, lawyers, and other experts assisting in the separation, and employee-related severance costs.\nAt-the-Market Program\nIn November and December 2023, Exelon issued approximately 3.6 million shares of Common stock at an average gross price of $39.58 per share.  The net proceeds from these issuances were $140 million, which were used for general corporate purposes. See Note 19 — Shareholders' Equity of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDistribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\nThe Utility Registrants file base rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. The outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the Utility Registrants’ current and future financial statements.\nThe following tables show the Utility Registrants’ completed and pending distribution base rate case proceedings in 2023. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these and other regulatory proceedings.\n43\nCompleted Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\nPending Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\n44\nTransmission Formula Rates\nThe following total increases/(decreases) were included in the Utility Registrants' 2023 annual electric transmission formula rate updates. All rates are effective June 1, 2023 to May 31, 2024, subject to review by interested parties pursuant to review protocols of each Utility Registrants' tariff. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nComEd's FERC Audit\nThe Utility Registrants are subject to periodic audits and investigations by FERC. FERC’s Division of Audits and Accounting initiated a nonpublic audit of ComEd in April 2021 evaluating ComEd’s compliance with (1) approved terms, rates and conditions of its federally regulated service; (2) accounting requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts; (3) reporting requirements of the FERC Form 1; and (4) the requirements for record retention. The audit period extends back to January 1, 2017. During the first quarter of  2023, ComEd was provided with information from FERC about several potential findings, including ComEd's methodology regarding the allocation of certain overhead costs to capital under FERC regulations. Based on the preliminary findings and discussions with FERC staff, ComEd determined that a loss was probable and recorded a regulatory liability to reflect its best estimate of that loss in the first quarter of 2023.\nOn July 27, 2023, FERC issued a final audit report which included, among other things, findings and recommendations related to ComEd's methodology regarding the allocation of certain overhead costs to capitalized construction costs under FERC regulations, including a suggestion that refunds may be due to customers for amounts collected in previous years. On August 28, 2023, ComEd filed a formal notice of the issues it will contest. On December 14, 2023, FERC appointed a settlement judge for the contested overhead allocation findings.  The final outcome and resolution of any contested audit issues as well as a reasonable estimate of potential future losses cannot be accurately estimated at this stage; however, the final resolution of these matters could result in recognition of future losses, above the amounts currently accrued, that could be material to the Exelon and ComEd financial statements.\nACE Employee Strike\nACE’s collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 210, expired on November 2, 2023. On November 5, 2023, IBEW Local 210 initiated a strike in ACE’s service territory. While the work stoppage did not result in a disruption in service to customers, Exelon, PHI, and ACE incurred unfavorable impacts to Net income of approximately $31 million, $31 million, and $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. On December 5, 2023, IBEW Local 210 ratified a new collective bargaining agreement with ACE and ceased the work stoppage.\nOther Key Business Drivers and Management Strategies\nUtility Rates and Rate Proceedings\nThe Utility Registrants file rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. The outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the Utility Registrants’ current and future\n45\nresults of operations, cash flows, and financial positions. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these regulatory proceedings.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\nOn November 15, 2021, President Biden signed the $1.2 trillion IIJA into law. IIJA provides for approximately $550 billion in new federal spending. Categories of funding include funding for a variety of infrastructure needs, including but not limited to: (1) power and grid reliability and resilience, (2) resilience for cybersecurity to address critical infrastructure needs, and (3) electric vehicle charging infrastructure for alternative fuel corridors. Federal agencies are developing guidelines to implement spending programs under IIJA. The time needed to develop these guidelines will vary with some limited program applications opened as early as the first quarter of 2022. The Registrants continue to evaluate programs under the legislation and consider possible opportunities to apply for funding, either directly or in potential collaborations with state and/or local agencies and key stakeholders. The Registrants cannot predict the ultimate timing and success of securing funding from programs under IIJA.\nIn September 2022, ComEd and BGE applied for the MMG, which establishes and funds construction, improvement, or acquisition of middle mile broadband infrastructure which creates high-speed internet services.  The MMG addresses inequitable broadband access by expansion and extension of the middle mile infrastructure in underserved communities. In June 2023, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announced it selected two of the applications submitted by BGE and ComEd; awarding ComEd and BGE $14.5 million and $15.4 million respectively. The applications selected by NTIA for BGE and ComEd proposed projects designed to enhance electric grid reliability and resiliency while leading and advancing shared local, state, and national goals to increase broadband connectivity, redundancy, affordability, and equity.\nIn March 2023, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI submitted three applications related to the Smart Grid Grants program under section 40107 of IIJA. These applications are focused on replacing existing Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS) in support of distributed energy resources (DERs) and grid-edged technologies, strengthening interoperability and data architecture of systems in support of two-way power flows and accelerating advanced metering deployment in disadvantaged communities. In October 2023, ComEd’s project, Deployment of a Community-Oriented Interoperable Control Framework for Aggregating and Integrating Distributed Energy Resources and Other Grid-Edge Devices, was recommended by the Grid Deployment Office (GDO) for negotiation of a final award up to $50 million. This project will enable ComEd and its local partners to deploy the next generation of grid technologies that support the growth of solar and electric vehicles (EVs), while piloting new local workforce training initiatives to support job creation connected to the clean energy transition. The GDO has indicated the award negotiation process can take approximately 120 days.\nIn April 2023, ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI submitted seven applications related to the Grid Resilience Grants program under section 40101(c) of IIJA. These applications are broadly focused on improving grid resilience with an emphasis on disadvantaged communities, relief of capacity constraints and modernizing infrastructure, deployment of DER and microgrid technologies and providing improved resilience through storm hardening projects. In October 2023, PECO’s project, Creating a Resilient, Equitable, and Accessible Transformation in Energy for Greater Philadelphia (CREATE), was recommended by the GDO for negotiation of a final award up to $100 million. This project will support critical electric infrastructure investments to help reduce the impact of extreme weather and historic flooding on the Registrants' electric distribution system. The GDO has indicated the award negotiation process can take approximately 120 days.\nThe Registrants are supporting three different Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub opportunities, covering all five states that Exelon operates in plus Washington D.C. under a program that will create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier that can deliver or store energy. Applications for the three opportunities under this program were submitted in April 2023. In October 2023 the DOE announced it selected two of the projects for further negotiation: (1) the Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2), which is being supported by PECO and PHI, and (2) the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen (MachH2), which is being supported by ComEd.\nIn November 2023, the GDO announced up to $3.9 billion available through the second-round funding opportunity of the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program for Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025. This funding opportunity focuses on projects that will improve electric transmission by increasing funding and\n46\nadvancing interconnection processes for faster build out of energy projects, create comprehensive solutions that link grid communications systems and operations to increase resilience and reduce power outages and threats, and deploy advanced technologies such as distributed energy resources and battery systems to provide essential grid services to ensure American communities across the country have access to affordable, reliable, clean electricity. Exelon, ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE submitted seven concept papers in response to the second round of the GRIP program. The concept papers are focused on improving the resilience of the electric grid and deployment of technologies to enhance grid flexibility and deliver benefits to customers and communities across the Exelon footprint. The GDO is expected to issue notifications of encouragement/discouragement for full applications in the first quarter of 2024. Exelon cannot predict if their concept papers will receive a notification of encouragement to submit a full application.\nPJM Regional Transmission Expansion\nOn April 6, 2023, PJM received a deactivation notice for Brandon Shores, a 1,282 MW coal generation plant located in BGE service territory. The deactivation was requested for June 1, 2025 and will result in numerous reliability issues across the region. In June 2023, PJM assigned a portion of transmission system upgrades to mitigate these reliability impacts to PECO, BGE, and Pepco.  In July 2023, PJM Board of Managers approved assigning Exelon transmission system upgrades to mitigate these reliability impacts to PECO, BGE, and Pepco.  The initial projected capital expenditures associated with these upgrades are approximately $80 million, $650 million, and $80 million for PECO, BGE, and Pepco, respectively. These amounts include a scope reduction estimated by PJM for PECO of $60 million associated with a transmission proposal window, as disclosed at a Transmission Expansion Advisory Committee meeting on October 31, 2023. The upgrades are expected to be completed by the end of 2028.\nSeparately, PJM held a competitive transmission proposal window from February 24, 2023 through May 31, 2023 to address reliability issues driven by significant load increases in northern Virginia. PECO, BGE, and Pepco submitted four solution proposals. At a meeting of the Transmission Expansion Advisory Committee on October 31, 2023, PJM recommended that PECO, BGE, Pepco, and DPL be awarded a portion of the work for the proposed solution. Initial estimated costs for these upgrades are approximately $70 million, $700 million, $80 million, and $5 million for PECO, BGE, Pepco, and DPL, respectively. The PJM Board of Managers approved the solution in December 2023 and the upgrades are expected to be completed by the end of 2030.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management believes that the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application or incorporate estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional information on the application of these accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill (Exelon, ComEd, and PHI)\nAs of December 31, 2023, Exelon’s $6.6 billion carrying amount of goodwill consists of $2.6 billion at ComEd and $4 billion at PHI. These entities are required to perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is assessed for impairment. ComEd has a single operating segment and reporting unit. PHI’s operating segments and reporting units are Pepco, DPL, and ACE. See Note 5 — Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Exelon's and ComEd’s goodwill has been assigned entirely to the ComEd reporting unit. Exelon's and PHI’s goodwill has been assigned to the Pepco, DPL, and ACE reporting units in the amounts of $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively. See Note 12 — Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nEntities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. As part of the qualitative assessments, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI evaluate, among other things, management's best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for their businesses, outcomes of recent regulatory proceedings, changes in certain market\n47\nconditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility peer EBITDA multiples, and the passing margin from their last quantitative assessments performed.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment assessment requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, and projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd’s, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's businesses and the fair value of debt.\nWhile the 2023 annual assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used in the assessment are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon’s, ComEd's, or PHI’s goodwill, which could be material.\nSee Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12 — Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUnamortized Energy Contract Liabilities (Exelon and PHI)\nUnamortized energy contract liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balances of non-derivative electricity contracts that Exelon acquired as part of the PHI merger. The initial amount recorded represents the difference between the fair value of the contracts at the time of acquisition and the contract value based on the terms of each contract. Offsetting regulatory assets were also recorded for those energy contract costs that are probable of recovery through customer rates. The unamortized energy contract liabilities and the corresponding regulatory assets, respectively, are amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows. Amortization of the unamortized energy contract liabilities are recorded through Purchased power and fuel expense. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters and Note 12 — Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDepreciable Lives of Property, Plant, and Equipment (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants have significant investments in electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets. These assets are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis, using the group, or composite methods of depreciation. The group approach is typically for groups of similar assets that have approximately the same useful lives and the composite approach is used for heterogeneous assets that have different lives. Under both methods, a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group. The estimation of asset useful lives requires management judgment, supported by formal depreciation studies of historical asset retirement experience. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically and as required by a rate regulator or regulatory action, or changes in retirement patterns indicate an update is necessary.\nDepreciation studies generally serve as the basis for amounts allowed in customer rates for recovery of depreciation costs. Generally, the Registrants adjust their depreciation rates for financial reporting purposes concurrent with adjustments to depreciation rates reflected in customer rates, unless the depreciation rates reflected in customer rates do not align with management’s judgment as to an appropriate estimated useful life or have not been updated on a timely basis. Depreciation expense and customer rates for ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE include an estimate of the future costs of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding regulatory liabilities and assets recorded by ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE related to removal costs.\nPECO’s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO’s regulatory recovery method. Estimates for such removal costs are also evaluated in the periodic depreciation studies.\nChanges in estimated useful lives of electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets could have a significant impact on the Registrants’ future results of operations. See Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding depreciation and estimated service lives of the property, plant, and equipment of the Registrants.\n48\nRetirement Benefits (All Registrants)\nExelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans. The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and inputs and accounting policy elections. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is affected by several assumptions including the discount rate, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, Exelon's contributions, the rate of compensation increases, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans, among others. The assumptions are updated annually and upon any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations.\nPension and OPEB plan assets include cash and cash equivalents, equity securities, including U.S. and international securities, and fixed income securities, as well as certain alternative investment classes such as real estate, private equity, private credit, and hedge funds.\nExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets.\nIn determining the EROA, Exelon considers historical economic indicators (including inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectation regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon’s target asset class allocations. Exelon calculates the amount of expected return on pension and OPEB plan assets by multiplying the EROA by the MRV of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments to be made during the year. In determining MRV, the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits allows the use of either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. For the majority of pension plan assets, Exelon uses a calculated value that adjusts for 20% of the difference between fair value and expected MRV of plan assets. Use of this calculated value approach enables less volatile expected asset returns to be recognized as a component of pension cost from year to year. For OPEB plan assets and certain pension plan assets, Exelon uses fair value to calculate the MRV.\nDiscount Rate.\nThe discount rates are determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high-quality non-callable (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and OPEB obligations. The spot rates are used to discount the estimated future benefit distribution amounts under the pension and OPEB plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. Exelon utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to determine the discount rates.\nMortality.\nThe mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. Exelon’s mortality assumption utilizes the SOA 2019 base table (Pri-2012) and MP-2021 improvement scale adjusted to use Proxy SSA ultimate improvement rates.\n49\nSensitivity to Changes in Key Assumptions.\nThe following tables illustrate the effects of changing certain of the actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant:\n__________\n(a)\nIn general, the discount rate will have a larger impact on the pension and OPEB cost and obligation as the rate moves closer to 0%. Therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated for larger increases or decreases in the discount rate. Additionally, Exelon utilizes a liability-driven investment strategy for its pension asset portfolio. The sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that changes in discount rates may have on pension asset returns.\nSee Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14 — Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans.\nRegulatory Accounting (All Registrants)\nFor their regulated electric and gas operations, the Registrants reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements, which is required for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities’ cost of providing services or products; and (3) a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent (1) revenue or gains that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates; or (2) billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of operations no longer meets the criteria discussed above, the Registrants would be required to eliminate any associated regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact, which could be material, would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nThe following table illustrates gains (losses) to be included in net income that could result from the elimination of regulatory assets and liabilities and charges against OCI related to deferred costs associated with Exelon's pension and OPEB plans that are recorded as Regulatory assets in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheets (before taxes) at December 31, 2023:\n___________\n(a)\nExelon's charge against OCI (before taxes) consists of up to $2.1 billion, $355 million, $485 million, $298 million, $122 million, and $22 million related to ComEd's, BGE's, PHI's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's respective portions of the deferred costs associated with Exelon's pension and OPEB plans. Exelon also has a net regulatory liability of $102 million (before taxes) related to PECO’s portion of the deferred costs associated with Exelon’s OPEB plans that would result in an increase in OCI if reversed.\n50\nSee Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding regulatory matters, including the regulatory assets and liabilities of the Registrants.\nFor each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, the Registrants assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or refund at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in each Registrant's jurisdictions, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. If the assessments and estimates made by the Registrants for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact in their consolidated financial statements could be material.\nRefer to the revenue recognition discussion below for additional information on the annual revenue reconciliations associated with ICC-approved electric distribution and energy efficiency formula rates for ComEd, and FERC transmission formula rate tariffs for the Utility Registrants.\nDerivative Financial Instruments (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk and interest rate risk related to ongoing business operations. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDetermining whether a contract qualifies as a derivative requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlying and one or more notional quantities.\nAll derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for certain derivatives that qualify for, and are elected under, NPNS. For derivatives that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value each period are initially recorded in AOCI and recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivatives intended to serve as economic hedges, which are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value each period are recognized in earnings on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income or are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability when there is an ability to recover or return the associated costs or benefits in accordance with regulatory requirements.\nNPNS.\nContracts that are designated as NPNS are not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather on an accrual basis of accounting. Determining whether a contract qualifies for NPNS requires judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all the associated qualification and documentation requirements. For all NPNS derivative instruments, accounts payable is recorded when derivatives settle and expense is recognized in earnings as the underlying physical commodity is consumed. Contracts that qualify for NPNS are those for which physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period, and the contract is not financially settled on a net basis. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for all contracts that are accounted for under NPNS.\nCommodity Contracts.\nThe Registrants make estimates and assumptions concerning future commodity prices, interest rates, and the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows in deciding whether to enter derivative transactions, and in determining the initial accounting treatment for derivative transactions. The Registrants categorize these derivatives under a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.\nDerivative contracts can be traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are generally categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain derivative pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, online exchanges. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, the model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, the model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs and are categorized in Level 3.\nThe Registrants consider nonperformance risk, including credit risk in the valuation of derivative contracts, and both historical and current market data in the assessment of nonperformance risk. The impacts of nonperformance and credit risk to date have generally not been material to the Registrants’ financial statements.\n51\nInterest Rate Derivative Instruments.\nExelon Corporate utilizes interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on existing and planned future debt issuances as well as potential fluctuations in Electric operating revenues at the corporate level in consolidation, which are directly correlated to yields on U.S. Treasury bonds under ComEd's distribution formula rate. The fair value of the swaps is calculated by discounting the future net cash flows to the present value based on the terms and conditions of the agreements and the forward interest rate curves. As these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate derivatives are primarily categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nSee ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK and Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants’ derivative instruments.\nIncome Taxes (All Registrants)\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the Registrants’ provisions for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances. The Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recorded in the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements.\nThe Registrants evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and their intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Registrants also assess negative evidence, such as the expiration of historical operating loss or tax credit carryforwards, that could indicate the Registrant's inability to realize its deferred tax assets. Based on the combined assessment, the Registrants record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.\nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including future changes in income tax laws, the Registrants’ forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. See Note 13 — Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies (All Registrants)\nIn the preparation of their financial statements, the Registrants make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information. The amount recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved. Such difference could have a significant impact in the Registrants' consolidated financial statements.\nEnvironmental Costs.\nEnvironmental investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which the Registrants will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties, the timing of the remediation work, regulations, and the requirements of local governmental authorities. Annual studies and/or reviews are conducted at ComEd, PECO, BGE, and DPL to determine future remediation requirements for MGP sites and estimates are adjusted accordingly. In addition, periodic reviews are performed at each of the Registrants to assess the adequacy of other environmental reserves. These matters, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a significant impact in the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements. See Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther, Including Personal Injury Claims.\nThe Registrants are self-insured for general liability, automotive liability, workers’ compensation, and personal injury claims to the extent that losses are within policy deductibles\n52\nor exceed the amount of insurance maintained. The Registrants have reserves for both open claims asserted, and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). The IBNR reserve is estimated based on actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding litigation and possible state and national legislative measures could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated. Accordingly, these claims, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material impact to the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues (All Registrants)\nSources of Revenue and Determination of Accounting Treatment.\nThe Registrants earn revenues from the sale and delivery of power and natural gas in regulated markets. The accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying transaction and applicable authoritative guidance. The Registrants primarily apply the Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and Alternative Revenue Program accounting guidance to recognize revenues as discussed in more detail below.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe Registrants recognize revenues in the period in which the performance obligations within contracts with customers are satisfied, which generally occurs when power and natural gas are physically delivered to the customer. Transactions of the Registrants within the scope of Revenue from Contracts with Customers generally include sales to utility customers under regulated service tariffs.\nThe determination of the Registrants' power and natural gas sales to individual customers is based on systematic readings of customer meters, generally monthly. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. The measurement of unbilled revenue is affected by the following factors: daily customer usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume, customer usage by class, losses of energy during delivery to customers and applicable customer rates. Increases or decreases in volumes delivered to the Registrant’s customers and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, revenues may fluctuate monthly as a result of customers electing to use an alternative supplier, since unbilled commodity revenues are not recorded for these customers. Changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date also impact the measurement of unbilled revenue; however, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged. See Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAlternative Revenue Program Accounting.\nCertain of the Registrants’ ratemaking mechanisms qualify as ARPs if they (i) are established by a regulatory order and allow for automatic adjustment to future rates, (ii) provide for additional revenues (above those amounts currently reflected in the price of utility service) that are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and (iii) allow for the collection of those additional revenues within 24 months following the end of the period in which they were recognized. For mechanisms that meet these criteria, which include the Registrants’ formula rate mechanisms and revenue decoupling mechanisms, the Registrants adjust revenue and record an offsetting regulatory asset or liability once the condition or event allowing additional billing or refund has occurred. The ARP revenues presented in the Registrants’ Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income include both: (i) the recognition of “originating” ARP revenues (when the regulator-specified condition or event allowing for additional billing or refund has occurred) and (ii) an equal and offsetting reversal of the “originating” ARP revenues as those amounts are reflected in the price of utility service and recognized as Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nComEd records ARP revenue for its best estimate of the electric distribution, energy efficiency, distributed generation rebates, and transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC and FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the electric and natural gas distribution revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by the MDPSC, DCPSC, and/or NJBPU in accordance with their revenue decoupling mechanisms. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with their formula rate mechanisms. Estimates of the current year revenue requirement are based on actual and/or forecasted costs and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory\n53\ncapital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. The estimated reconciliation can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred, investments made, allowed ROE, and actions by regulators or courts.\nSee Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Customer Accounts Receivable (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants estimate the allowance for credit losses on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and forward-looking risk factors to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. Risk segments represent a group of customers with similar forward-looking credit quality indicators and risk factors that are comprised based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history and represent expected, future customer behavior. Loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on a historical average of charge-offs as a percentage of accounts receivable in each risk segment. The Registrants' customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. The Registrants' customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. The Registrants' allowances for credit losses will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices, and economic conditions as well as changes in ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DEPSC, and NJBPU regulations.\n54\nComEd\nResults of Operations by Registrant\nResults of Operations—ComEd\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\n.\nNet income\nincreased by $173 million primarily due to increases in electric distribution formula rate earnings (reflecting higher allowed ROE due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates and the impacts of higher rate base) and carrying costs related to CMC regulatory assets.\nThe changes in\nOperating revenues\nconsisted of the following:\nRevenue Decoupling.\nThe demand for electricity is affected by weather and customer usage. Operating revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather, usage per customer, or number of customers as a result of revenue decoupling mechanisms implemented pursuant to FEJA.\nDistribution Revenue.\nEIMA and FEJA provide for a performance-based formula rate, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. Electric distribution revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs (e.g., severe weather and storm restoration), investments being recovered, and allowed ROE. Electric distribution revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, due to higher allowed ROE due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates, the impact of a higher rate base, and higher fully recoverable costs.\n55\nComEd\nTransmission Revenue.\nUnder a FERC-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recov\nered, and the highest daily peak load, which is updated annually in January based on the prior calendar year. Generally, increases/decreases in the highest daily peak load will result in higher/lower transmission revenue. T\nransmission revenues increased during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to the impact of a higher rate base and higher fully recoverable costs.\nEnergy Efficiency Revenue.\nFEJA provides for a performance-based formula rate, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. Under FEJA, energy efficiency revenue varies from year to year based upon fl\nuctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered, and allowed ROE. Energy efficiency revenue\nincreased during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to the impact of a higher rate base, and increased regulatory asset amortization, which is fully recoverable.\nOther Revenue\nprimarily includes assistance provided to other utili\nties through mutual assistance programs.\nOther revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, which primarily reflects mutual assistance revenues associated with storm restoration efforts.\nRegulatory Required Programs\nrepresents revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as recoveries under the credit loss expense tariff, environmental costs associated with MGP sites, ETAC, and costs related to electricity, ZEC, CMC, and REC procurement. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding CMCs. ETAC is a retail customer surcharge collected by electric utilities operating in Illinois established by CEJA and remitted to an Illinois state agency for programs to support clean energy jobs and training. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery. The costs of these programs are included in Purchased power expense, Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, and Taxes other than income. Customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. Customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries as ComEd remains the distribution service provider for all customers and charges a regulated rate for distribution service, which is recorded in Operating revenues. For customers that choose to purchase electric generation from competitive suppliers, ComEd either acts as the billing agent or the competitive supplier separately bills its own customers, and therefore does not record Operating revenues or Purchased power expense related to the electricity. For customers that choose to purchase electric generation from ComEd, ComEd is permitted to recover the electricity, ZEC, CMC, and REC procurement costs without mark-up and therefore records equal and offsetting amounts in Operating revenues and Purchased power expense related to the electricity, ZECs, CMCs, and RECs.\nSee Note 5 — Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the presentation of ComEd's revenue disaggregation.\nThe increase of $1,707 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, in\nPurchased power expense\nis primarily due to the CMCs from the participating nuclear-powered generating facilities, which is offset by an increase in Operating revenues as part of regulatory required programs.

See Note 13 — Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAll results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are presented on a GAAP basis.\nThe Registrants’ operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations, as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. The Registrants’ businesses are capital intensive and require considerable capital resources. Each of the Registrants annually evaluates its financing plan, dividend practices, and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining its investment grade ratings while meeting its cash needs to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund pension and OPEB obligations. The Registrants spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment. Additionally, the Utility Registrants operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be delayed or limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time. Each Registrant’s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Registrants no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, the Registrants have access to credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $4.0 billion, as of December 31, 2023. The Registrants utilize their credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings, and to issue letters of credit. See the “Credit Matters and Cash Requirements” section below for additional information. The Registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs, and capital expenditure requirements. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Registrants’ debt and credit agreements.\nCash flows related to Generation have not been presented as discontinued operations and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for all periods presented. The Exelon Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes no cash flows from Generation. The Exelon Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes one months of cash flows from Generation. See below for additional reasons for the changes in cash flows.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe Utility Registrants' cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity and, in the case of PECO, BGE, and DPL, gas distribution services. The Utility Registrants' distribution services are provided to an established and diverse base of retail customers. The Utility Registrants' future cash flows may be affected by the economy, weather conditions, future legislative initiatives, future\n75\nregulatory proceedings with respect to their rates or operations, and their ability to achieve operating cost reductions. Additionally, ComEd is required to purchase CMCs from participating nuclear-powered generating facilities for a five-year period, and all of its costs of doing so will be recovered through a new rider. The price to be paid for each CMC is established through a competitive bidding process. ComEd will provide net payments to, or collect net payments from, customers for the difference between customer credits issued and the credit to be received from the participating nuclear-powered generating facilities. ComEd’s cash flows are affected by the establishment of CMC prices and the timing of recovering costs through the CMC regulatory asset.\nSee Note 3 — Regulatory Matters and Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on regulatory and legal proceedings and proposed legislation.\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 by Registrant:\nChanges in the Registrants' cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in each Registrant’s respective results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business, except as discussed below. See above for additional information related to cash flows from Generation. Significant operating cash flow impacts for the Registrants and Generation for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n•\nSee Note 22 —Supplemental Financial Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Registrants’ Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional information on\nnon-cash operating activities\n.\n•\nChanges in collateral\ndepended upon whether the Registrant was in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, and collateral may have been required to be posted with or collected from its counterparties.  In addition, the collateral posting and collection requirements differed depending on whether the transactions were on an exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. Changes in collateral for the Utility Registrants are dependent upon the credit exposure of procurement contracts that may require suppliers to post collateral. The amount of cash collateral received from external counterparties increased due to rising energy prices. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nSee Note 13 — Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional information on\nincome taxes.\n•\nChanges in\nPension and non-pension postretirement benefit contributions\nrelate to Exelon's funding strategy and incremental contributions made in 2022 in connection with the separation. See Note 14 — Retirement Benefits\n76\n•\nChanges in Regulatory assets and liabilities, net,\nare due to the timing of cash payments for costs recoverable, or cash receipts for costs recovered, under our regulatory mechanisms differs from the recovery period of those costs. Included within the changes is energy efficiency spend for ComEd of $416 million and $394 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Also included within the changes is energy efficiency and demand response programs spend for BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE of $132 million, $70 million, $25 million, and $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and $113 million, $71 million, $28 million, and $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. PECO had no energy efficiency and demand response programs spend recorded to a regulatory asset for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nChanges in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities\nfor the Utility Registrants and Exelon Corporate total $146 million and for Generation total $323 million. The change for Generation primarily relates to the revolving accounts receivable financing arrangement. The change in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities for Exelon Corporate and the Utility Registrants is dependent upon the normal course of operations for all Registrants. For ComEd, it is also dependent upon whether the participating nuclear-powered generating facilities owe money to ComEd as a result of the established pricing for CMCs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the established pricing resulted in ComEd owing payments to nuclear-powered generating facilities, which is reported within the cash flows from operations as a change in Accounts payable and accrued expense.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 by Registrant:\nSignificant investing cash flow impacts for the Registrants for 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n•\nVariances in\nCapital expenditures\nare primarily due to the timing of cash expenditures for capital projects. See the \"Credit Matters and Cash Requirements\" section below for additional information on projected capital expenditure spending for the Utility Registrants. See Note 2 — Discontinued Operations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for Capital expenditures related to Generation prior to the separation.\n•\nCollection of DPP\nrelates to Generation's revolving accounts receivable financing agreement which Generation entered into in April 2020.\n77\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 by Registrant:\nSignificant financing cash flow impacts for the Registrants for 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n•\nChanges in short-term borrowings, net\n, is driven by repayments on and issuances of notes due in less than 365 days. Refer to Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Short-term borrowings for the Registrants.\n•\nLong-term debt, net,\nvaries due to debt issuances and redemptions each year. Refer to the debt issuances and redemptions tables below for additional information for the Registrants.\n•\nChanges in\nintercompany money pool\nare driven by short-term borrowing needs. Refer below for more information regarding the intercompany money pool.\n•\nIssuance of common stock\nrelates to the August 2022 underwritten public offering of Exelon common stock as well as 2023 issuances under the ATM program. See Note 19 — Shareholders' Equity of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nExelon’s ability to pay\ndividends\non its Common stock depends on the receipt of dividends paid by its operating subsidiaries. The payments of dividends to Exelon by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting Retained earnings. See Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on dividend restrictions. See below for quarterly dividends declared.\n•\nRepayments on short-term borrowings,\nvaries due to debt issuances and redemptions each year. Refer to Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on repayments on short-term borrowings for the Registrants.\n•\nRefer to Note 2 — Discontinued Operations for the T\nransfer of cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents to Constellation\nrelated to the separation.\n•\nOther financing activities\nprimarily consists of debt issuance costs. See debt issuances table below for additional information on the Registrants’ debt issuances.\n78\nDebt Issuances and Redemptions\nSee Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information of the Registrants’ long-term debt. Debt activity for 2023 and 2022 by Registrant was as follows:\nDuring 2023, the following long-term debt was issued:\n79\nDuring 2022, the following long-term debt was issued:\n__________\n(a)\nIn connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, Exelon entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the representatives of the initial purchasers of the Notes and other parties. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, Exelon filed a registration statement on August 3, 2022, with respect to an offer to exchange the Notes for substantially similar notes of Exelon that are registered under the Securities Act. An exchange offer of registered notes for the Notes was completed on January 12, 2023.  The registered notes issued in exchange for Notes in the exchange offer have terms identical in all respects to the Notes, except that their issuance was registered under the Securities Act.\n(b)\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the SMBC Term Loan, U.S. Bank Term Loan, and PNC Term Loan were all reclassified to Long-term debt due within one year on the Exelon Consolidated Balance Sheet, given that the Term Loans have maturity dates of July 21, 2023, and July 24, 2023, respectively.\n80\nDuring 2023, the following long-term debt was retired and/or redeemed:\nDuring 2022, the following long-term debt was retired and/or redeemed:\nAdditionally, in connection with the separation, on January 31, 2022, Exelon Corporate received cash from Generation of $258 million to settle an intercompany loan that mirrored the terms and amounts of the third-party debt obligations. The loan agreements were entered into as part of the 2012 Constellation merger. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the mirror debt.\nFrom time to time and as market conditions warrant, the Registrants may engage in long-term debt retirements via tender offers, open market repurchases or other viable options to reduce debt on their respective balance sheets.\nDividends\nQuarterly dividends declared by the Exelon Board of Directors during the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the first quarter of 2024 were as follows:\n___________\n(a)\nExelon's Board of Directors approved an updated dividend policy for 2024. The 2024 quarterly dividend will be $0.38 per share.\n81\nCredit Matters and Cash Requirements\nThe Registrants fund liquidity needs for capital expenditures, working capital, energy hedging, and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets, and large, diversified credit facilities. The credit facilities include $4.0 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $2.4 billion was available to support additional commercial paper as of December 31, 2023, and of which no financial institution has more than 6% of the aggregate commitments for the Registrants. The Registrants had access to the commercial paper markets and had availability under their revolving credit facilities during 2023 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. Exelon Corporate and the Utility Registrants each have a 5-year revolving credit facility. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Registrants had access to the commercial paper markets and had availability under their revolving credit facilities during 2023 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. The Registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. The Registrants closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising, and merger activity. See PART I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.\nThe Registrants believe their cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets, and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to support the estimated future cash requirements discussed below.\nOn August 4, 2022, Exelon entered into an agreement with certain underwriters in connection with an underwritten public offering of 12.995 million shares of its Common stock, no par value. The net proceeds were $563 million before expenses paid. Exelon used the proceeds, together with available cash balances, to repay $575 million in borrowings under a $1.15 billion term loan credit facility. See Note 19 — Shareholders' Equity and Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn August 4, 2022, Exelon executed an equity distribution agreement (“Equity Distribution Agreement”) with certain sales agents and forward sellers and certain forward purchasers establishing an ATM equity distribution program under which it may offer and sell shares of its Common stock, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.0 billion. Exelon has no obligation to offer or sell any shares of Common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may at any time suspend or terminate offers and sales under the Equity Distribution Agreement. In November and December 2023, Exelon issued approximately 3.6 million shares of Common stock at an average gross price of $39.58 per share. The net proceeds from these issuances were $140 million, which were used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2023, $858 million of Common stock remained available for sale pursuant to the ATM program.\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement between Exelon and Constellation Energy Corporation, Exelon made a cash payment of $1.75 billion to Generation on January 31, 2022. See Note 2 — Discontinued Operations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the separation.\nThe following table presents the incremental collateral that each Utility Registrant would have been required to provide in the event each Utility Registrant lost its investment grade credit rating at December 31, 2023 and available credit facility capacity prior to any incremental collateral at December 31, 2023:\n__________\n(a)\nRepresents incremental collateral related to natural gas procurement contracts.\n82\nCapital Expenditures\nAs of December 31, 2023, estimates of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements are as follows:\n___________\n(a)\nNumbers rounded to the nearest $25M and may not sum due to rounding.\n(b)\nIncludes estimated capital expenditures for the Utility Registrants from 2025 to 2027.\n(c)\nEffective in 2024, ComEd has chosen to update its rate of capitalization of certain overhead costs on a prospective basis.\nProjected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors. Projected capital expenditures at the Utility Registrants are for continuing projects to maintain and improve operations, including enhancing reliability and adding capacity to the transmission and distribution systems. The Utility Registrants anticipate that they will fund their capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings and additional capital contributions from parent.\nRetirement Benefits\nManagement considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act), management of the pension obligation, and regulatory implications. The Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). The projected contributions below reflect a funding strategy to make annual contributions with the objective of achieving 100% funded status on an ABO basis over time. This funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions. Exelon’s estimated annual qualified pension contributions will be $93 million in 2024. Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon’s non-qualified pension plans are not funded, given they are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements.\nWhile OPEB plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, Exelon does fund certain of its plans. For Exelon's funded OPEB plans, contributions generally equal accounting costs, however, Exelon’s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its OPEB plans, including liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid, and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery). The amounts below include benefit payments related to unfunded plans.\n83\nThe following table provides all Registrants' planned contributions to the qualified pension plans, planned benefit payments to non-qualified pension plans, and planned contributions to OPEB plans in 2024:\nTo the extent interest rates decline significantly or the pension and OPEB plans earn less than the expected asset returns, annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase. Conversely, to the extent interest rates increase significantly or the pension and OPEB plans earn greater than the expected asset returns, annual pension and OPEB contribution requirements in future years could decrease. Additionally, expected contributions could change if Exelon changes its pension or OPEB funding strategy.\nSee Note 14 — Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and OPEB contributions.\nCash Requirements for Other Financial Commitments\nThe following tables summarize the Registrants' future estimated cash payments as of December 31, 2023 under existing financial commitments:\nExelon\n__________\n(a)\nIncludes amounts from ComEd and PECO financing trusts.\n(b)\nInterest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions, or debt issuances.

These estimates are subject to significant variability from period to period.\n87\nACE\n__________\n(a)\nInterest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions, or debt issuances.\n(b)\nRepresents the future estimated value, as of December 31, 2023, of the cash flows associated with all contracts, both cancellable and non-cancellable, entered into between ACE and third-parties for the provision of services and materials, entered into in the normal course of business not specifically reflected elsewhere in this table. These estimates are subject to significant variability from period to period.\nSee Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information of the Registrants’ other commitments potentially triggered by future events. Additionally, see below for where to find additional information regarding the financial commitments in the tables above in the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:\nCredit Facilities\nExelon Corporate, ComEd, and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. PECO meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. Pepco, DPL, and ACE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the PHI intercompany money pool. P\nHI Corporate meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of short-term notes and the Exelon intercompany money pool.\nThe Registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit.\nSee Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Registrants’ credit facilities and short term borrowing activity.\n88\nCapital Structure\nAs of December 31, 2023, the capital structures of the Registrants consisted of the following:\n__________\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2022, Exelon's Long-term debt and Common equity capital structure percentages were 57% and 38%, respectively. The change in capital structure percentages above is a result of a decrease in common equity due to the separation of Constellation in addition to an increase in long-term debt issuances. See Note 2 — Discontinued Operations for additional information regarding the separation.\n(b)\nIncludes approximately $390 million, $205 million, and $184 million owed to unconsolidated affiliates of Exelon, ComEd, and PECO respectively. These special purpose entities were created for the sole purposes of issuing mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities of ComEd and PECO.\nSecurity Ratings\nThe Registrants’ access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, may depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets.\nThe Registrants’ borrowings are not subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading of a Registrant’s securities could increase fees and interest charges under that Registrant’s credit agreements.\nAs part of the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into contracts that contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Registrants and their counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contracts law, if the Registrants are downgraded by a credit rating agency, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include the posting of additional collateral. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on collateral provisions.\nThe credit ratings for Exelon Corporate, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE did not change for the year ended December 31, 2023. On July 26, 2023, S&P raised ComEd's long-term issuer credit rating from 'BBB+' to a 'A-'. S&P also affirmed the current 'A' rating on ComEd's senior secured debt and 'A-2' short-term rating, which influences long and short-term borrowing cost. On December 20, 2023, Moody's revised its outlook on ComEd to negative from stable due to the final order issued by the ICC on December 14, 2023 rejecting ComEd's proposed Grid Plan and establishing retail rates for 2024-2027 as further discussed in Note 3 — Regulatory Matters. At the same time, Moody's affirmed ComEd's current 'A1' senior secured debt rating and its 'P-2' short-term rating.\n89\nIntercompany Money Pool\nTo provide an additional short-term borrowing option that will generally be more favorable to the borrowing participants than the cost of external financing, both Exelon and PHI operate an intercompany money pool. Maximum amounts contributed to and borrowed from the money pool by participant and the net contribution or borrowing as of December 31, 2023, are presented in the following tables.\nShelf Registration Statements\nExelon, ComEd and Pepco have a currently effective combined shelf registration statement that expires in 2025.  PECO and BGE plan to file a new combined shelf registration in the first quarter of 2024. DPL and ACE periodically issue securities through the private placement markets. The ability of each Registrant to sell securities off the shelf registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend on a number of factors at the time of the proposed sale, including other required regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the Registrant, its securities ratings and market conditions.\nRegulatory Authorizations\nThe Utility Registrants are required to obtain short-term and long-term financing authority from Federal and State Commissions as follows:\n__________\n(a)\nOn June 29, 2023, ComEd filed an application for $2 billion in new money long-term debt financing authority from the ICC, which was approved on December 14, 2023. The finance authority under the approved application has an effective date of January 1, 2024, and extends the expiration date to January 1, 2027.\n(b)\nOn December 21, 2022, BGE received approval from the MDPSC for $1.8 billion in new long-term financing authority with an effective date of January 4, 2023.\n(c)\nOn June 9, 2022 and June 30, 2022, Pepco received approval from the MDPSC and DCPSC, respectively, for $1.4 billion in new long-term financing authority. The long-term financing authority became effective on the date of respective approvals and has an expiration date of December 31, 2025.\n90\n(d)\nOn November 2, 2022, DPL filed with the MDPSC and DEPSC for approval of $1.2 billion in new long-term financing authority with an effective date of December 14, 2022. The financing authority filed with MDPSC does not have an expiration date, while the financing authority filed with DEPSC has an expiration date of December 31, 2025.\n(e)\nOn July 14, 2023, ACE filed an application with the NJBPU for renewal of its short-term financing authority through December 31, 2025. ACE received approval on December 20, 2023.\n(f)\nOn October 2, 2023, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, and DPL filed applications with FERC for renewal of their short-term financing authority through December 31, 2025. ComEd, PECO, Pepco, and DPL received approval on December 7, 2023. BGE received approval on December 8, 2023."

    "text": "The Registrants hold commodity and financial instruments that are exposed to the following market risks:\n•\nCommodity price risk, which is discussed further below.\n•\nCounterparty credit risk associated with non-performance by counterparties on executed derivative instruments and participation in all, or some of the established, wholesale spot energy markets that are administered by PJM. The credit policies of PJM may, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot energy market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of counterparty credit risk related to derivative instruments.\n•\nEquity price and interest rate risk associated with Exelon’s pension and OPEB plan trusts. See Note 14 — Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nInterest rate risk associated with changes in interest rates for the Registrants’ outstanding long-term debt. This risk is significantly reduced as substantially all of the Registrants’ outstanding debt has fixed interest rates. There is inherent interest rate risk related to refinancing maturing debt by issuing new long-term debt. The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, Exelon Corporate may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges, or to lock in rate levels on borrowings, which are typically designated as economic hedges. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nElectric operating revenues risk associated with ComEd's distribution formula rate. ComEd's ROE for its electric distribution service through 2023 was directly correlated to yields on U.S. Treasury bonds. Exelon Corporate utilized interest rate derivatives to mitigate volatility and manage risk to Exelon, which were typically accounted for as economic hedges. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Beginning January 1, 2024 ComEd's ROE for its electric distribution service will use a fixed rate and no longer be exposed to volatility in yields on U.S. Treasury bonds. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters for additional information.\nThe Utility Registrants operate primarily under cost-based rate regulation limiting exposure to the effects of market risk. Hedging programs are utilized to reduce exposure to energy and natural gas price volatility and have no direct earnings impacts as the costs are fully recovered through regulatory-approved recovery mechanisms.\nExelon manages these risks through risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. Risk management issues are reported to Exelon’s Board of Directors, Exelon's Audit and Risk Committee, and/or the applicable Utility Board Registrant. The Registrants do not execute derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes.\n91\nCommodity Price Risk (All Registrants)\nCommodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. To the extent the total amount of energy Exelon purchases differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon is exposed to market fluctuations in commodity prices. Exelon seeks to mitigate its commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity and natural gas.\nComEd entered into 20-year floating-to-fixed renewable energy swap contracts beginning in June 2012, which are considered an economic hedge and have changes in fair value recorded to an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. ComEd has block energy contracts to procure electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process, which are considered derivatives and qualify for NPNS, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE have contracts to procure electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process. BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE have certain full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives and qualify for NPNS, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. Other full requirements contracts are not derivatives.\nPECO, BGE, and DPL also have executed derivative natural gas contracts, which qualify for NPNS, to hedge their long-term price risk in the natural gas market.\nFor additional information on these contracts, see Note 3 — Regulatory Matters and Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents maturity and source of fair value for Exelon's and ComEd's mark-to-market commodity contract liabilities. The table provides two fundamental pieces of information.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n101\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company applies the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which requires management to record in the consolidated financial statements the effects of cost-based rate regulation for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria, (i) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (ii) rates are designed to recover the entity’s cost of providing services or products; and (iii) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. The Company accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Upon updates in material regulatory and legislative proceedings, where applicable, management will record new regulatory assets or liabilities and will assess whether it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively, in future rates. As of December 31, 2023, there were $10.9 billion of regulatory assets and $10.0 billion of regulatory liabilities.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company’s accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the high degree of audit effort to assess the impact of regulation on accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities and to evaluate the complex audit evidence related to whether the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to accounting for regulatory matters and evaluation of new and existing regulatory assets and liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining the Company’s correspondence with regulators, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s interpretation of regulatory guidance and proceedings and the related accounting implications, and recalculating regulatory assets and liabilities based on provisions outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with regulators.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 21, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2000.\n102\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders of Commonwealth Edison Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, of Commonwealth Edison Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)(i), and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)(ii) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company applies the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which requires management to record in the consolidated financial statements the effects of cost-based rate regulation for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria, (i) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (ii) rates are designed to recover the entity’s cost of providing services or products; and (iii) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. The Company accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Upon updates in material regulatory and legislative proceedings, where applicable, management will record new regulatory assets or liabilities and will assess whether it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be\n109\nrecovered and settled, respectively, in future rates. As of December 31, 2023, there were $1.9 billion of regulatory assets and $1.0 billion of regulatory liabilities.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company’s accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the high degree of audit effort to assess the impact of regulation on accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities and to evaluate the complex audit evidence related to whether the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to accounting for regulatory matters and evaluation of new and existing regulatory assets and liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining the Company’s correspondence with regulators, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s interpretation of regulatory guidance and proceedings and the related accounting implications, and recalculating regulatory assets and liabilities based on provisions outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with regulators.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 21, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2001.\n110\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo\nthe Board of Directors and Shareholder of Potomac Electric Power Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the financial statements, including the related notes, of Potomac Electric Power Company (the “Company”) as listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(6)(i), and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(6)(ii) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).

The separation was completed on February 1, 2022, creating two publicly traded companies, Exelon and Constellation. See Note 2 — Discontinued Operations for additional information.\nBasis of Presentation (All Registrants)\nThis is a combined annual report of all Registrants. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to the Registrants as indicated parenthetically next to each corresponding disclosure. When appropriate, the Registrants are named specifically for their related activities and disclosures. Each of the Registrant’s Consolidated Financial Statements includes the accounts of its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated, except for the historical transactions between the Utility Registrants and Generation for the purposes of presenting discontinued operations in all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nThrough its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost, including legal, human resources, financial, information technology, and supply management services. PHI also has a business services subsidiary, PHISCO, which provides a variety of support services at cost, including legal, finance, engineering, customer operations, transmission and distribution planning, asset management, system operations, and power procurement, to PHI operating Registrants. The costs of BSC and PHISCO are directly charged or allocated to the applicable subsidiaries. The results of Exelon’s corporate operations are presented as “Other” within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless otherwise disclosed.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Exelon owned\n100\n% of PECO, BGE, and PHI and more than\n99\n% of ComEd. PHI owns\n100\n% of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. As of December 31, 2021, Exelon owned\n100\n% of Generation. As of February 1, 2022, as a result of the completion of the separation, Exelon no longer owns any  interest in Generation. The separation of Constellation, including Generation and its subsidiaries, meets the\n157\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Significant Accounting Policies\ncriteria for discontinued operations and as such, its results of operations are presented as discontinued operations and have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented. Accounting rules require that certain BSC costs previously allocated to Generation be presented as part of Exelon’s continuing operations as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations. Comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows related to Generation have not been segregated and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively, for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. See Note 2 — Discontinued Operations for additional information.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for annual financial statements and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.\nCOVID-19 (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants have taken steps to mitigate the potential risks posed by the global outbreak (pandemic) of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The Registrants provide a critical service to their customers and have taken measures to keep employees who operate the business safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus, including extra precautions for employees who work in the field. The Registrants have implemented work from home policies where appropriate.\nManagement makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and accompanying notes, and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by those financial statements and accompanying notes. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and through the date of this report, management assessed certain accounting matters that require consideration of forecasted financial information, including, but not limited to, allowance for credit losses and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets, in context with the information reasonably available and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19. The Registrants' future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to their consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nUse of Estimates (All Registrants)\nThe preparation of financial statements of each of the Registrants in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas in which significant estimates have been made include, but are not limited to, the accounting for pension and OPEB, unbilled energy revenues, allowance for credit losses, inventory reserves, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment assessments, derivative instruments, unamortized energy contracts, fixed asset depreciation, environmental costs and other loss contingencies, AROs, and taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRegulatory Accounting (All Registrants)\nFor their regulated electric and gas operations, the Registrants reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements, which is required for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities’ cost of providing services or products; and (3) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. The Registrants account for their regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, principally the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DEPSC, and NJBPU, under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized and the related expense or revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consistent with the recovery or refund included in customer rates. The Registrants' regulatory assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date are probable of being recovered or settled in future rates. If a separable portion of the Registrants' business was no longer able to meet the criteria discussed above, the affected entities would be required to eliminate from their consolidated financial statements the effects of regulation for that portion, which could have a material impact on their financial statements. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters for additional information.\nWith the exception of income tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities, the Registrants classify regulatory assets and liabilities with a recovery or settlement period greater than one year as both current and noncurrent in\n158\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Significant Accounting Policies\ntheir Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the current portion representing the amount expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers over the next twelve-month period as of the balance sheet date. Income tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities are classified entirely as noncurrent in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets to align with the classification of the related deferred income tax balances.\nThe Registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements as a non-recognized subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order.\nRevenues (All Registrants)\nOperating Revenues.\nThe Registrants’ operating revenues generally consist of revenues from contracts with customers involving the sale and delivery of power and natural gas and utility revenues from ARP. The Registrants recognize revenue from contracts with customers to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that the entities expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The primary sources of revenue include regulated electric and natural gas tariff sales, distribution, and transmission services. At the end of each month, the Registrants accrue an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy delivered or services provided to customers.\nComEd records ARP revenue for its best estimate of the electric distribution, energy efficiency, and transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC and FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the electric and natural gas distribution revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by the MDPSC, DCPSC, and/or NJBPU in accordance with their revenue decoupling mechanisms. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with their formula rate mechanisms. The Registrants recognize all ARP revenues that will be collected within 24 months of the end of the annual period in which they are recorded. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters for additional information.\nTaxes Directly Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions.\nThe Registrants collect certain taxes from customers such as sales and gross receipts taxes, along with other taxes, surcharges, and fees, that are levied by state or local governments on the sale or distribution of electricity and gas. Some of these taxes are imposed on the customer, but paid by the Registrants, while others are imposed on the Registrants. Where these taxes are imposed on the customer, such as sales taxes, they are reported on a net basis with no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. However, where these taxes are imposed on the Registrants, such as gross receipts taxes or other surcharges or fees, they are reported on a gross basis. Accordingly, revenues are recognized for the taxes collected from customers along with an offsetting expense. Se\ne\nNote 22 — Supplemental Financial Information for taxes that are presented on a gross basis.\nLeases (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases with a term of greater than one year. Operating lease ROU assets are included in Other deferred debits and other assets and operating lease liabilities are included in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance lease ROU assets are included in Plant, property, and equipment, net and finance lease liabilities are included in Long-term debt due within one year and Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ROU asset is measured as the sum of (1) the present value of all remaining fixed and in-substance fixed payments using the rate implicit in the lease whenever that is readily determinable or each Registrant’s incremental borrowing rate, (2) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date (less any lease incentives received), and (3) any initial direct costs incurred. The lease liability is measured the same as the ROU asset, but excludes any payments made before the commencement date and initial direct costs incurred. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Registrants include non-lease components, which are service-related costs that are not integral to the use of the asset, in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability.\nExpense for operating leases and leases with a term of one year or less is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the derivation of benefit from use of the leased property. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the\n159\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Significant Accounting Policies\nrelated obligation is incurred. Operating lease expense, finance lease expense, and variable lease payments are primarily recorded to Operating and maintenance expense on the Registrants’ Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nIncome from operating leases, including subleases, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the pattern in which income is earned over the term of the lease. Variable lease income is recognized in the period in which the related obligation is performed. Operating lease income and variable lease income are recorded to Operating revenues on the Registrants’ Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nThe Registrants’ operating and finance leases consist primarily of real estate including office buildings and vehicles and equipment. The Registrants account for land right arrangements that provide for exclusive use as leases while shared use land arrangements are generally not leases. The Registrants do not account for secondary use pole attachments as leases.\nSee Note 10 — Leases for additional information.\nIncome Taxes (All Registrants)\nDeferred federal and state income taxes are recorded on significant temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax benefits carried forward. Investment tax credits have been deferred in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in book income over the life of the related property. The Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than\n50\n% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Registrants recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense, net or Other, net (interest income) and recognize penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Other, net in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nCash and Cash Equivalents (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants consider investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents (All Registrants)\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents represent funds that are restricted to satisfy designated current liabilities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Registrants' restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented the following items:\n__________\n(a) As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, ACE had\nno\nrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\n160\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Significant Accounting Policies\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents not available to satisfy current liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Registrants' noncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented ComEd’s over-recovered RPS costs and alternative compliance payments received from RES pursuant to FEJA and costs for the remediation of an MGP site.\nSee Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 22 — Supplemental Financial Information for additional information.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Accounts Receivables (All Registrants)\nThe allowance for credit losses reflects the Registrants’ best estimates of losses on the customers' accounts receivable balances based on historical experience, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nThe allowance for credit losses is developed by applying loss rates for each Utility Registrant, based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and forward-looking risk factors, to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. Utility Registrants' customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are primarily recorded to Operating and maintenance expense on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or Regulatory assets and liabilities on the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the regulatory recovery of credit losses on customer accounts receivable.\nThe Registrants have certain non-customer receivables in Other deferred debits and other assets which primarily are with governmental agencies and other high-quality counterparties with no history of default. As such, the allowance for credit losses related to these receivables is not material.  The Registrants monitor these balances and will record an allowance if there are indicators of a decline in credit quality. See Note 6 — Accounts Receivable for additional information.\nInventories (All Registrants)\nInventory is recorded at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. Provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory. Fossil fuel and Materials and supplies are generally included in inventory when purchased. Fossil fuel is expensed to Purchased power and fuel expense when used or sold. Materials and supplies generally includes transmission and distribution materials and are expensed to Operating and maintenance or capitalized to Property, plant, and equipment, as appropriate, when installed or used.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment (All Registrants)\nProperty, plant, and equipment is recorded at original cost. Original cost includes construction-related direct labor and material costs and indirect construction costs including labor and related costs of departments associated with supporting construction activities. When appropriate, original cost also includes AFUDC for regulated property at the Utility Registrants. The cost of repairs and maintenance and minor replacements of property is charged to Operating and maintenance expense as incurred.\nThird parties reimburse the Utility Registrants for all or a portion of expenditures for certain capital projects. Such contributions in aid of construction costs (CIAC) are recorded as a reduction to Property, plant, and equipment, net.\nUpon retirement, the cost of property, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation consistent with the composite and group methods of depreciation. Depreciation expense at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement. Actual incurred removal costs are applied against a related regulatory liability or recorded to a regulatory asset if in excess of previously collected removal costs. PECO’s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO’s regulatory recovery method.\nCapitalized Software.\nCertain costs, such as design, coding, and testing incurred during the application development stage of software projects that are internally developed or purchased for operational use are capitalized within Property, plant, and equipment. Similar costs incurred for cloud-based solutions treated as\n161\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Significant Accounting Policies\nservice arrangements are capitalized within Other Current Assets and Deferred Debits and Other Assets. Such capitalized amounts are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become operational, generally not to exceed five years. Certain other capitalized software costs are being amortized over longer lives based on the expected life or pursuant to prescribed regulatory requirements.\nAFUDC.\nAFUDC is the cost, during the period of construction, of debt and equity funds used to finance construction projects for regulated operations. AFUDC is recorded to construction work in progress and as a non-cash credit to an allowance that is included in interest expense for debt-related funds and other income and deductions for equity-related funds. The rates used for capitalizing AFUDC are computed under a method prescribed by regulatory authorities.\nSee Note 7 — Property, Plant, and Equipment, Note 8 — Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant and Note 22 — Supplemental Financial Information for additional information.\nDepreciation and Amortization (All Registrants)\nDepreciation is generally recorded over the estimated service lives of property, plant, and equipment on a straight-line basis using the group or composite methods of depreciation. The group approach is typically for groups of similar assets that have approximately the same useful lives and the composite approach is used for dissimilar assets that have different lives. Under both methods, a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE's depreciation expense includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement, which is consistent with each utility's regulatory recovery method. PECO's removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO's regulatory recovery method. The estimated service lives for the Registrants are based on a combination of depreciation studies and historical retirements. See Note 7 — Property, Plant, and Equipment for additional information regarding depreciation.\nAmortization of regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded over the recovery or refund period specified in the related legislation or regulatory order or agreement. When the recovery or refund period is less than one year, amortization is recorded to the line item in which the deferred cost or income would have originally been recorded in the Registrants’ Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Amortization of ComEd’s electric distribution and energy efficiency formula rate regulatory assets and the Utility Registrants' transmission formula rate regulatory assets is recorded to Operating revenues.\nAmortization of income tax related regulatory assets and liabilities is generally recorded to Income tax expense. Except for the regulatory assets and liabilities discussed above, amortization is generally recorded to Depreciation and amortization in the Registrants’ Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income when the recovery period is more than one year.\nSee Note 3 — Regulatory Matters and Note 22 — Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding the amortization of the Registrants' regulatory assets.\nAsset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants estimate and recognize a liability for their legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities even though the timing and/or methods of settlement may be conditional on future events. The Registrants update their AROs either annually or on a rotational basis at least once every three years, based on a risk profile, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates. The updates factor in new cost estimates, credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (CARFR) and escalation rates, and the timing of cash flows. AROs are accreted throughout each year to reflect the time value of money for these present value obligations through an increase to Regulatory assets. See Note 9 — Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.\nGuarantees (All Registrants)\nIf necessary, the Registrants recognize a liability at the time of issuance of a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations they have undertaken by issuing the guarantee. The liability is reduced or eliminated as the Registrants are released from risk under the guarantee. Depending on the nature of the guarantee, the release from risk of the Registrant may be recognized only upon the expiration or settlement of the guarantee or by a\n162\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Significant Accounting Policies\nsystematic and rational amortization method over the term of the guarantee. See Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.\nAsset Impairments\nLong-Lived Assets (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include specific regulatory disallowance, abandonment, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. When the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the long-lived asset may not be recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset over its fair value.\nGoodwill (Exelon, ComEd, and PHI).\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note 12 — Intangible Assets for additional information.\nDerivative Financial Instruments (All Registrants)\nDerivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify for certain exceptions, including NPNS. For derivatives that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value each period are initially recorded in AOCI and recognized in earnings when the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings.  Amounts recognized in earnings are recorded in Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income based on the activity the transaction is economically hedging.\nCash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are included as a component of operating, investing, or financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the nature of each transaction.\nFor derivatives intended to serve as economic hedges, which are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value each period are recognized in earnings or as a regulatory asset or liability each period. Amounts recognized in earnings are recorded in Electric operating revenues, Purchased power and fuel, or Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income based on the activity the transaction is economically hedging. Changes in fair value are also recorded as a regulatory asset or liability when there is an ability to recover or return the associated costs or benefits in accordance with regulatory requirements. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing, or financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the nature of the hedged item. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters and Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.\nRetirement Benefits (All Registrants)\nExelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans.\nThe plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under these plans are measured as of December 31. The measurement involves various factors, assumptions, and accounting elections. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and OPEB obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Gains or losses in excess of the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. See Note 14 — Retirement Benefits for additional information.\nNew Accounting Standards (All Registrants)\nNew Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Adopted as of December 31, 2023:\nThe following new authoritative accounting guidance issued by the FASB has not yet been adopted and reflected by the Registrants in their consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023. Unless otherwise indicated, the Registrants are currently assessing the impacts such guidance may have (which could be material) in their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements\n163\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Significant Accounting Policies\nof Cash Flows and disclosures, as well as the potential to early adopt where applicable. The Registrants have assessed other FASB issuances of new standards which are not listed below given the current expectation that such standards will not significantly impact the Registrants' financial reporting.\nSegment Reporting (Issued November 2023).\nImproves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The objective of the revised guidance is to introduce a new requirement to disclose significant segment expenses regularly provided to the CODM, extend  certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarify single reportable segment entities must apply ASC 280 in its entirety, permit more than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and require disclosure of the title and position of the CODM. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2024 and interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The standard will be applied retrospectively.\nImprovement to Income Tax Disclosures (Issued December 2023).\nProvides additional disclosure requirements related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. Under the revised guidance for the effective tax reconciliations, entities would be required to disclose: (1) eight specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation in both percentages and reporting currency amount, (2) additional information for reconciling items over a certain threshold, (3) explanation of individual reconciling items disclosed, and (4) provide a qualitative description of the state and local jurisdictions that contribute to the majority of the state income tax expense. For each annual period presented, the new standard requires disclosure of the year-to-date amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign. It also requires additional disaggregated information on income taxes paid (net of refunds received) to an individual jurisdiction equal to or greater than 5% of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The standard is effective January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted.\n2.\nDiscontinued Operations (Exelon)\nOn February 21, 2021, Exelon's Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Utility Registrants and Generation, creating two publicly traded companies (\"the separation\"). Exelon completed the separation on February 1, 2022, through the distribution of\n326,663,937\ncommon stock shares of Constellation, the new publicly traded company, to Exelon shareholders. Under the separation plan, Exelon shareholders retained their current shares of Exelon stock and received one share of Constellation common stock for every three shares of Exelon common stock held on January 20, 2022, the record date for the distribution, in a transaction that was tax-free to Exelon and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nConstellation was newly formed and incorporated in Pennsylvania on June 15, 2021 for the purposes of separation and holds Generation (including Generation's subsidiaries).\nPursuant to the separation:\n•\nExelon entered into four term loans consisting of a 364-day term loan for $\n1.15\nbillion and three 18-month term loans for $\n300\nmillion, $\n300\nmillion, and $\n250\nmillion, respectively. Exelon issued these term loans primarily to fund the cash payment to Constellation and for general corporate purposes. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information.\n•\nExelon made a cash payment of $\n1.75\nbillion to Constellation on January 31, 2022.\n•\nExelon contributed its equity ownership interest in Generation to Constellation. Exelon no longer retains any equity ownership interest in Generation or Constellation.\n•\nExelon transferred certain corporate assets and employee-related obligations to Constellation.\n•\nExelon received cash from Generation of $\n258\nmillion to settle the intercompany loan on January 31, 2022. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information.\nContinuing Involvement\nIn order to govern the ongoing relationships between Exelon and Constellation after the separation, and to facilitate an orderly transition, Exelon and Constellation have entered into several agreements, including the following:\n164\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 2 — Discontinued Operations\n•\nSeparation Agreement – governs the rights and obligations between Exelon and Constellation regarding certain actions to be taken in connection with the separation, among others, including the allocation of assets and liabilities between Exelon and Constellation.\n•\nTransition Services Agreement (TSA) – governs the terms and conditions of the services that Exelon provides to Constellation and Constellation provides to Exelon for an expected period of two years, provided that certain services may be longer than the term and services may be extended with approval from both parties. The services include specified accounting, finance, information technology, human resources, employee benefits, and other services that have historically been provided on a centralized basis by BSC. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the amounts Exelon billed Constellation and Constellation billed Exelon for these services were $\n151\nmillion recorded in Other income, net and $\n14\nmillion recorded in Operating and maintenance expense, respectively. For the period from February 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, the amounts Exelon billed Constellation and Constellation billed Exelon for these services were $\n266\nmillion recorded in Other income, net and $\n43\nmillion recorded in Operating and maintenance expense, respectively.\n•\nTax Matters Agreement (TMA) – governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Exelon and Constellation with respect to all tax matters, including tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax returns, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. See Note 13 — Income Taxes for additional information.\nIn addition, the Utility Registrants will continue to incur expenses from transactions with Constellation after the separation. Prior to the separation, such expenses were primarily recorded as Purchased power from affiliates and an immaterial amount recorded as Operating and maintenance expense from affiliates at the Utility Registrants. After the separation, such expenses are primarily recorded as Purchased power and an immaterial amount recorded as Operating and maintenance expense at the Utility Registrants.\n•\nComEd had an ICC-approved RFP contract with Constellation to provide a portion of ComEd’s electric supply requirements. ComEd also purchased RECs and ZECs from Constellation.\n•\nPECO received electric supply from Constellation under contracts executed through PECO’s competitive procurement process. In addition, PECO had a ten-year agreement with Constellation to sell solar AECs.\n•\nBGE received a portion of its energy requirements from Constellation under its MDPSC-approved market-based SOS and gas commodity programs.\n•\nPepco received electric supply from Constellation under contracts executed through Pepco’s competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC and DCPSC.\n•\nDPL received a portion of its energy requirements from Constellation under its MDPSC and DEPSC approved market-based SOS commodity programs.\n•\nACE received electric supply from Constellation under contracts executed through ACE’s competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU.\nComEd and PECO also have receivables with Constellation for estimated excess funds at the end of decommissioning the Regulatory Agreement Units, such amounts are due back to ComEd and PECO, as applicable, for payment to their respective customers. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters and Note 23 — Related Party Transactions for additional information.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe separation represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on Exelon’s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the separation met the criteria for discontinued operations.\nThere were\nno\nresults from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe following table presents the results of Constellation that have been reclassified from continuing operations and included in discontinued operations within Exelon’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n165\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 2 — Discontinued Operations\nThese results are primarily Generation, which is comprised of Exelon’s Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and Other Power Regions reportable segments, and include the impact of transaction costs, certain BSC costs, including any transition costs, that were historically allocated and directly attributable to Generation, transactions between Generation and the Utility Registrants, and tax-related adjustments. Transaction costs include costs for external bankers, accountants, appraisers, lawyers, external counsels and other advisors, among others, who are involved in the negotiation, appraisal, due diligence and regulatory approval of the separation. Transition costs are primarily employee-related costs such as recruitment expenses, costs to establish certain stand-alone functions and information technology systems, professional services fees, and other separation-related costs during the transition to separate Generation. For the purposes of reporting discontinued operations, these results also include transactions between Generation and the Utility Registrants that were historically eliminated within Exelon’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, as these transactions will be ongoing after the separation. Certain BSC costs that were historically allocated to Generation are presented as part of continuing operations in Exelon’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations per the accounting rules.\n__________\n(a)\nIncludes transaction and transition costs related to the separation of $\n52\nmillion and $\n43\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThere were\nno\nassets or liabilities of discontinued operations included in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Constellation had net assets of $\n11,573\nmillion that separated on February 1, 2022 that resulted in a reduction to Exelon's equity during the year ended December 31, 2022. Refer to the Distribution of Constellation line in Exelon's Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity for further information.\nThere w\nere\nno\nd\niscontinued operations included within Exelon's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe following table presents selected financial information regarding cash flows of the discontinued operations that are included within Exelon’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n166\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 2 — Discontinued Operations\n3.\nRegulatory Matters (All Registrants)\nThe following matters below discuss the status of material regulatory and legislative proceedings of the Registrants.\nDistribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\nThe following tables show the completed and pending distribution base rate case proceedings in 2023.\nCompleted Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\n167\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\n__________\n(a)\nComEd’s 2023 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of $\n144\nmillion for the initial year revenue requirement for 2023 and an increase of $\n55\nmillion related to the annual reconciliation for 2021. The revenue requirement for 2023 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of\n5.94\n% inclusive of an allowed ROE of\n7.85\n%, reflecting the monthly average yields for 30-year treasury bonds plus\n580\nbasis points. The reconciliation revenue requirement for 2021 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of\n5.91\n%, inclusive of an allowed ROE of\n7.78\n%, reflecting the monthly yields on 30-year treasury bonds plus\n580\nbasis points less a performance metrics penalty of\n7\nbasis points. ComEd's last performance-based electric distribution formula rate update filing under EIMA was completed in 2022. See discussion of CEJA below for details on the transition away from the electric distribution formula rate.\n(b)\nReflects a four-year cumulative multi-year rate plan for January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2027. On December 14, 2023, the ICC approved year-over-year distribution revenue requirement increases in 2024-2027, with an amendatory order on January 10, 2024, of approximately $\n451\nmillion effective January 1, 2024, $\n14\nmillion effective January 1, 2025, $\n6\nmillion effective January 1, 2026, and $\n30\nmillion effective January 1, 2027, based on an ROE of\n8.905\n%, an equity ratio of\n50\n%, and year end 2022 rate base. The ICC rejected ComEd’s Grid Plan, requiring ComEd to file a revised Grid Plan by March 13, 2024, 90 days after the issuance of the December final order. The ICC also directed that the revised Grid Plan would be reviewed through further formal proceedings in that docket. On January 10, 2024, the ICC granted one portion of ComEd’s application for rehearing of the December 14, 2023 final order, and directing that a 150-day rehearing process reconsider the revenue requirements for the test years (2024-2027), absent an approved Grid Plan. On January 31,2024, the ICC further clarified the scope of the rehearing process. ComEd anticipates that the revenue requirements determined during the rehearing process will be further updated upon approval of a revised Grid Plan. On January 10, 2024, ComEd also filed with the Illinois appellate court an appeal of various aspects of the ICC’s final order on which rehearing was denied, including the\n8.905\n% ROE,\n50\n% equity ratio, and denial of any return on ComEd’s pension asset.\n168\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\n(c)\nOn November 30, 2023, the Delivery Reconciliation Amount for 2022 defined in Rider Delivery Service Pricing Reconciliation (Rider DSPR) was approved. The delivery reconciliation amount allows for the reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect in the final years in which formula rates are determined and until such time as new rates are established under ComEd’s approved MRP. The 2023 filing reconciled the delivery service rates in effect in 2022 with the actual delivery service costs incurred in 2022. The reconciliation revenue requirement provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of\n6.48\n%, inclusive of an allowed ROE of\n8.91\n%, reflecting the monthly yields on 30-year treasury bonds plus\n580\nbasis points.\n(d)\nThe PECO electric and natural gas base rate case proceedings were resolved through settlement agreements, which did not specify an approved ROE.\n(e)\nReflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for 2021 through 2023. BGE proposed to use certain tax benefits to fully offset the increases in 2021 and 2022 and partially offset the increase in 2023. The MDPSC awarded BGE electric revenue requirement increases of $\n59\nmillion, $\n39\nmillion, and $\n42\nmillion, before offsets, in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, and natural gas revenue requirement increases of $\n53\nmillion, $\n11\nmillion, and $\n10\nmillion, before offsets, in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. However, the MDPSC utilized the tax benefits to fully offset the increases in 2021 and January 2022 such that customer rates remained unchanged. For the remainder of 2022, the MDPSC chose to offset only\n25\n% of the cumulative 2021 and 2022 electric revenue requirement increases and\n50\n% of the cumulative gas revenue requirement i\nncreases. In 2021, the MDPSC deferred a decision on whether to use certain tax benefits to offset the revenue requirement increases in 2023 and directed BGE to make another proposal at the end of 2022. In September 2022, BGE proposed that tax benefits not be used to offset the 2023 revenue requirement increases. On October 26, 2022, the MDPSC accepted BGE's recommendation to not use tax benefits to offset the 2023 revenue requirement increases\n.\n(f)\nReflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026. The MDPSC awarded BGE electric revenue requirement increases of $\n41\nmillion, $\n113\nmillion, and $\n25\nmillion in 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively, and natural gas revenue requirement increases of $\n126\nmillion, $\n62\nmillion, and $\n41\nmillion in 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively. Requested revenue requirement increases will be used to recover capital investments designed to increase the resilience of the electric and gas distribution systems and support Maryland's climate and regulatory initiatives. The MDPSC also approved a portion of the requested 2021 and 2022 reconciliation amounts, which will be recovered through separate electric and gas riders starting in 2024. As such, the reconciliation amounts are not included in the approved revenue requirement increases. The 2021 reconciliation amounts are $\n13\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion for electric and gas, respectively, and the 2022 reconciliation amounts are $\n39\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion for electric and gas, respectively.\n(g)\nReflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2024. The MDPSC awarded Pepco electric incremental revenue requirement increases of $\n21\nmillion, $\n16\nmillion, and $\n15\nmillion, before offsets, for the 12-month periods ending March 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Pepco proposed to utilize certain tax benefits to fully offset the increase through 2023 and partially offset customer rate increases in 2024. However, the MDPSC only utilized the acceleration of refunds for certain tax benefits to fully offset the increases such that customer rates remain unchanged through March 31, 2022. On February 23, 2022, the MDPSC chose to offset\n25\n% of the cumulative revenue requirement increase through March 31, 2023. In 2021, the MDPSC deferred a decision on whether to use certain tax benefits to offset the revenue requirement increases for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2024. In December 2022 Pepco proposed that tax benefits not be used to offset the revenue requirement increases for this period. On January 25, 2023, the MDPSC accepted Pepco’s recommendations not to use tax benefits to offset revenue requirement increases for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2024.\n(h)\nReflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025. The MDPSC awarded DPL electric incremental revenue requirement increases of $\n17\nmillion, $\n6\nmillion, and $\n6\nmillion for 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively.\n(i)\nRequested and approved increases are before New Jersey sales and use tax. The NJBPU awarded ACE electric revenue requirement increases of $\n36\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion effective December 1, 2023 and February 1, 2024, respectively.\n169\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nPending Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\n__________\n(a)\nReflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026 submitted to the DCPSC. Pepco requested total electric revenue requirement increases of $\n117\nmillion, $\n37\nmillion, and $\n37\nmillion in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.  Requested revenue requirement increases will be used to recover capital investments designed to advance system-readiness and support the District of Columbia’s climate and clean energy goals.\n(b)\nReflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2027 submitted to the MDPSC.  Pepco requested total electric revenue requirement increases of $\n69\nmillion, $\n54\nmillion and $\n51\nmillion effective April 1, 2024, April 1, 2025, and April 1, 2026, respectively through its rebuttal filing made on January 26, 2024.  The plan contains a proposed nine-month extension period with a requested revenue requirement increase of $\n14\nmillion effective April 1, 2027 through December 31, 2027. Requested revenue requirement increases will be used to recover capital investments designed to advance system-readiness and support Maryland's climate and clean energy goals.  On August 7, 2023, the MDPSC issued an order approving a settlement agreement which allows Pepco to establish a revenue deferral mechanism to recover its full Commission-authorized year 1 increase between July 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025 and extend the procedural schedule to address intervenor resource constraints.\n(c)\nThe rates went into effect on July 15, 2023, subject to refund.\nTransmission Formula Rates\nThe Utility Registrants' transmission rates are each established based on a FERC-approved formula. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE are required to file an annual update to the FERC-approved formula on or before May 15, and PECO is required to file on or before May 31, with the resulting rates effective on June 1 of the same year. The annual update for ComEd is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions (initial year revenue requirement). The update for ComEd also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect beginning June 1 of the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year (annual reconciliation). The annual update for PECO is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions, accumulated depreciation, and accumulated deferred income taxes. The annual update for BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions, accumulated depreciation, Depreciation and amortization expense, and accumulated deferred income taxes. The update for PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE also reconciles any differences between the actual costs and actual revenues for the calendar year (annual reconciliation).\n170\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nFor 2023, the following total increases/(decreases) were included in the Utility Registrants' electric transmission formula rate updates:\n__________\n(a)\nAll rates are effective June 1, 2023 - May 31, 2024, subject to review by interested parties pursuant to review protocols of each Utility Registrants' tariff.\n(b)\nRepresents the weighted average debt and equity return on transmission rate bases. For ComEd and PECO, the common equity component of the ratio used to calculate the weighted average debt and equity return on the transmission formula rate base is currently capped at\n55\n% and\n55.75\n%, respectively.\n(c)\nThe rate of return on common equity for each Utility Registrant includes a\n50\n-basis-point incentive adder for being a member of a RTO.\n(d)\nThe increase in BGE's transmission revenue requirement includes a $\n3\nmillion reduction related to a FERC-approved dedicated facilities charge to recover the costs of providing transmission service to specifically designated load by BGE.\nOther State Regulatory Matters\nIllinois Regulatory Matters\nCEJA (Exelon and ComEd).\nOn September 15, 2021, the Governor of Illinois signed into law CEJA. CEJA includes, among other features, (1) procurement of CMCs from qualifying nuclear-powered generating facilities, (2) a requirement to file a general rate case or a new four-year MRP no later than January 20, 2023 to establish rates effective after ComEd’s existing performance-based distribution formula rate sunsets, (3) requirements that ComEd and the ICC initiate and conduct various regulatory proceedings on subjects including ethics, spending, grid investments, and performance metrics.\nComEd Electric Distribution Rates\nComEd filed, and received approval for, its last performance-based electric distribution formula rate update  under EIMA in 2022; those rates were in effect throughout 2023.\nOn February 3, 2022, the ICC approved a tariff that establishes the process under which ComEd reconciled its 2022 and will reconcile its 2023 rate year revenue requirements with actual costs. Those reconciliation amounts are determined using the same process used for prior reconciliations under the performance-based electric distribution formula rate. Using that process, for the rate years 2022 and 2023 ComEd will ultimately collect revenues from customers reflecting each year’s actual recoverable costs, year-end rate base, and a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base, with the ROE component based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds plus\n580\nbasis points. In April 2023, ComEd filed its first petition with the ICC to reconcile its 2022 actual costs with the approved revenue requirement that was in effect in 2022; the final order was issued on November 30, 2023, for rates beginning January 2024. In 2024, ComEd will file with the ICC its 2023 actual costs with the approved revenue requirement that was in effect in 2023.\n171\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nBeginning in 2024, ComEd will recover from retail customers, subject to certain exceptions, the costs it incurs to provide electric delivery services either through its electric distribution rate or other recovery mechanisms authorized by CEJA. On January 17, 2023, ComEd filed a petition with the ICC seeking approval of a MRP for 2024-2027. The MRP supports a multi-year grid plan (Grid Plan), also filed on January 17, covering planned investments on the electric distribution system within ComEd’s service area through 2027.  Costs incurred during each year of the MRP are subject to ICC review and the plan’s revenue requirement for each year will be reconciled with the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred for that year. The reconciliation is subject to adjustment for certain costs, including a limitation on recovery of costs that are more than\n105\n% of certain costs in the previously approved MRP revenue requirement, absent a modification of the rate plan itself. Thus, for example, the rate adjustments necessary to reconcile 2024 revenues to ComEd’s actual 2024 costs incurred would take effect in January 2026 after the ICC’s review during 2025. On May 22, 2023, direct testimony was filed by ICC staff and more than a dozen intervenors and intervenor groups. The testimonies addressed a wide variety of topics, including rate of return on equity, capital structure, grid planning, various distribution grid and information technology investments, and affordability and customer service. ComEd also made voluntary adjustments and, per the ICC’s final beneficial electrification order requiring ComEd to recover beneficial electrification costs through the MRP, increased its total revenue requirement request from $\n1.472\nbillion to $\n1.545\nbillion. ComEd filed its reply brief on September 27, 2023, to adjust its total requested revenue requirement increase to $\n1.487\nbillion.\nOn December 14, 2023, the ICC issued a final order. The ICC rejected ComEd’s Grid Plan as non-compliant with certain requirements of CEJA, and required ComEd to file a revised Grid Plan by March 13, 2024, 90 days after the issuance of the final order. In the absence of an approved Grid Plan, the ICC set ComEd’s forecast revenue requirements for 2024-2027 based on ComEd's approved year-end 2022 rate base. This results in a total cumulative revenue requirement increase of $\n501\nmillion, a $\n986\nmillion total revenue reduction from the requested cumulative revenue requirement increase but remains subject to annual reconciliation in accordance with CEJA. The final order approved the process and formulas associated with the MRP reconciliation mechanisms. The ICC did not approve a previously proposed phase-in of the ICC's approved year-over-year revenue increases, and it also denied ComEd's ability to earn a return on its pension asset.\nOn December 22, 2023, ComEd filed an application for rehearing on several findings in the final order including the use of the 2022 year-end rate base to establish forecast revenue requirements for 2024-2027, ROE, pension asset return, and capital structure. On January 10, 2024, ComEd’s app\nlication for rehearing was denied on all issues except for the order’s use of the 2022 year-end rate base. On January 31, 2024, the ICC granted ComEd's motion seeking additional clarification on the scope on rehearing, generally accepting ComEd's proposal and confirming that the rehearing will determine if the forecasted year-end 2023 rate base should be used to set rates for 2024 through 2027 until a refiled Grid Plan is approved. A final rehearing order on that topic is statutorily required by early June 2024. On January 10, 2024, ComEd also filed an appeal in the Illinois Appellate Court of the issues on which rehearing was denied, including but not limited to the allowed ROE and denial of a return on ComEd’s pension asset. There is no deadline by when the appellate court must rule. On February 8, 2024, the ICC denied ComEd's request to provide clarification on other issues including the schedule for review of the refiled Grid Plan. ComEd has completed and placed in service additional utility plant assets in 2023 and will continue to complete and place in service additional utility plant assets prior to the approval of the new Grid Plan. There are still significant unknowns, but ComEd does not currently believe that it is probable that the initially uncollected depreciation or return on the recently completed plant will ultimately be disallowed.\nIn January 2022, ComEd filed a request with the ICC proposing performance metrics that would be\nused in determining ROE incentives and penalties in the event ComEd filed a MRP in January 2023. On September 27, 2022, the ICC issued a final order approving seven performance metrics that provide symmetrical performance adjustments of\n32\ntotal basis points to ComEd’s rate of return on common equity based on the extent to which ComEd achieves the annual performance goals. On November 10, 2022, the ICC granted ComEd's application for rehearing, in part. On April 5, 2023, the ICC issued its final order on rehearing for the performance and tracking metrics proceeding, in which the ICC declined to adopt ComEd's proposed modifications to the reliability and peak load reduction performance metrics. Efforts are underway to implement the performance metrics, which took effect on January 1, 2024. ComEd will make its initial filing in 2025 to assess performance achieved under the metrics in 2024, and to determine any ROE adjustment, which would take effect in 2026.\n172\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nCarbon Mitigation Credit\nCEJA establishes decarbonization requirements for Illinois as well as programs to support the retention and development of emissions-free sources of electricity. ComEd is required to purchase CMCs from participating nuclear-powered generating facilities between June 1, 2022 and May 31, 2027. The price to be paid for each CMC was established through a competitive bidding process that included consumer-protection measures that capped the maximum acceptable bid amount and a formula that reduces CMC prices by an energy price index, the base residual auction capacity price in the ComEd zone of PJM, and the monetized value of any federal tax credit or other subsidy if applicable. The consumer protection measures contained in CEJA will result in net payments to ComEd ratepayers if the energy index, the capacity price and applicable federal tax credits or subsidy exceed the CMC contract price. In the June 2022 billing period. ComEd began issuing credits to its retail customers under its new CMC rider. A regulatory asset is recorded for the difference between customer credits issued and the credit to be received from the participating nuclear-powered generating facilities. The balance as of December 31, 2023 is $\n673\nmillion.\nUnder CEJA, the costs of procuring CMCs, including carrying costs, are recovered through a rider, the Rider Carbon-Free Resource Adjustment (Rider CFRA). As originally approved by the ICC, Rider CFRA provides for an annual reconciliation and true-up to actual costs incurred or credits received by ComEd to purchase CMCs, with any difference to be credited to or collected from ComEd’s retail customers in subsequent periods. The difference between the net payments to (or receivables from) ComEd ratepayers and the credits received by ComEd to purchase CMCs is recorded to Purchased power expense with an offset to the regulatory asset (or regulatory liability). On December 21, 2022, ComEd filed an amendment to Rider CFRA proposing that it recover costs or provide credits faster than the tariff allows, implement monthly reconciliations, and allow ComEd to adjust Rider CFRA rates based not only on anticipated differences but also past payments or credits, and implement monthly reconciliations beginning with the June 2023 delivery period. The ICC approved the proposal on January 19, 2023. In addition, on March 24, 2023, ComEd submitted revisions to Rider CFRA which clarified the methodology for calculating interest to be included in the annual reconciliation associated with the June 2022 through May 2023 delivery year. The ICC approved the proposal on April 20, 2023. On February 2, 2024, ComEd filed a petition with the ICC to initiate the reconciliation proceeding for the costs incurred in connection with the procurement of CMCs during the delivery year beginning June 1, 2022 and extending through May 31, 2023.\nExcess Deferred Income Taxes\nThe ICC initiated a docket to accelerate and fully credit to customers TCJA unprotected property-related EDIT no later than December 31, 2025. On July 7, 2022, the ICC issued a final order on the schedule for the acceleration of EDIT amortization, adopting the proposal as submitted by several parties, including ComEd, ICC Staff, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Citizens Utility Board. EDIT amortization will be credited to customers through a new rider from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025.\nBeneficial Electrification Plan\n173\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nOn March 23, 2023, the ICC issued its final order approving the beneficial electrification plan for ComEd. The ICC rejected ComEd's request to treat a large portion of  beneficial electrification costs as a regulatory asset and ordered ComEd to seek cost recovery through the multi-year rate plan filing for 2024 and 2025, and the final formula rate reconciliation docket for 2023, rather than through a separate charge. The order also authorized an overall annual budget of $\n77\nmillion per year for the three year plan period (2023 through 2025), with flexibility to roll forward unused funds to future years within the same plan period. On April 18, 2023, ComEd filed an application for rehearing in the beneficial electrification plan docket. The Chicago Transit Authority and City of Chicago, jointly, and the Office of the Illinois Attorney General (ILAG) also filed applications for rehearing. On April 27, 2023, ICC staff filed a motion for clarification, seeking clarification from the ICC on the precise budget described in the final order. On May 8, 2023, the ICC denied all applications for rehearing, and entered an amendatory order regarding the annual beneficial electrification plan budgets. ComEd has been directed to use good faith efforts to spend $\n77\nmillion annually. ComEd subsequently filed its compliance filing in May 2023, detailing project related spending, clarifying the procedure that will be used to seek stakeholder feedback related to beneficial electrification pilot programs, and including the timeline for tariff changes required to implement the programs. ComEd and the ILAG both filed appeals of the ICC’s interim order that addressed the permissible scope of utility beneficial electrification programs outside of transportation and the rate impact cap. The ILAG also filed an appeal seeking reversal of portions of the ICC’s final decision. The final order partly mooted ComEd’s appeal of the interim order and ComEd has decided not to pursue the other issues. As such, ComEd moved to voluntarily dismiss its appeal and the appellate court granted that request. The ILAG consolidated their appeals. Any ruling on the appeals, even a negative ruling removing programs from the BE Plan or lowering the overall budget of the BE Plan, will only impact forward-looking costs.\nEnergy Efficiency\nCEJA extends ComEd’s current cumulative annual energy efficiency MWh savings goals through 2040, adds expanded electrification measures to those goals, increases low-income commitments and adds a new performance adjustment to the energy efficiency formula rate.  ComEd expects its annual spend to increase in 2023 through 2040 to achieve these energy efficiency MWh savings goals, which will be deferred as a separate regulatory asset that will be recovered through the energy efficiency formula rate over the weighted average useful life, as approved by the ICC, of the related energy efficiency measures.\nEnergy Efficiency Formula Rate (Exelon and ComEd).\nFEJA allows ComEd to defer energy efficiency costs (except for any voltage optimization costs which are recovered through the electric distribution formula rate) as a separate regulatory asset that is recovered through the energy efficiency formula rate over the weighted average useful life, as approved by the ICC, of the related energy efficiency measures. ComEd earns a return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset at a rate equal to its weighted average cost of capital, which is based on a year-end capital structure and calculated using the same methodology applicable to ComEd’s electric distribution formula rate. Beginning January 1, 2018, the ROE that ComEd earns on its energy efficiency regulatory asset is subject to a maximum downward or upward adjustment of 200 basis points if ComEd’s cumulative persisting annual MWh savings falls short of or exceeds specified percentage benchmarks of its annual incremental savings goal. ComEd is required to file an update to its energy efficiency formula rate on or before June 1\nst\neach year, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year. The annual update is based on projected current year energy efficiency costs, PJM capacity revenues, and the projected year-end regulatory asset balance less any related deferred income taxes (initial year revenue requirement). The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred from the year (annual reconciliation). The approved energy efficiency formula rate also provides for revenue decoupling provisions similar to those in ComEd’s electric distribution formula rate.\n174\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nDuring 2023, the ICC approved the following total increases in ComEd's requested energy efficiency revenue requirement:\n_________\n(a)\nComEd's 2024 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of $\n71\nmillion for the initial year revenue requirement for 2024 and a increase of $\n47\nmillion related to the annual reconciliation for 2022. The revenue requirement for 2024 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset and rate base of\n6.48\n% inclusive of an allowed ROE of\n8.91\n%, reflecting the monthly average yields for 30-year treasury bonds plus\n580\nbasis points. The revenue requirement for the 2022 reconciliation year provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset and rate base of\n7.47\n% inclusive of an allowed ROE of\n10.89\n%, which includes an upward performance adjustment that increased the ROE. The performance adjustment can either increase or decrease the ROE based upon the achievement of energy efficiency savings goals. See table below for ComEd's regulatory assets associated with its energy efficiency formula rate.\nMaryland Regulatory Matters\nMaryland Revenue Decoupling (Exelon, BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL).\nIn 1998, the MDPSC approved natural gas monthly rate adjustments for BGE and in 2007, the MDPSC approved electric monthly rate adjustments for BGE and BSAs for Pepco and DPL, all of which are decoupling mechanisms. As a result of the decoupling mechanisms, certain Operating revenues from electric and natural gas distribution at BGE and Operating revenues from electric distribution at Pepco Maryland (see also District of Columbia Revenue Decoupling below for Pepco District of Columbia) and DPL are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer. For BGE, Pepco, and DPL, the decoupling mechanism eliminates the impacts of abnormal weather or customer usage by recognizing revenues based on an authorized distribution amount per customer by customer class. Operating revenues from electric and natural gas distribution at BGE and Operating revenues from electric distribution at Pepco Maryland and DPL are, however, impacted by changes in the number of customers.\nMaryland Order Directing the Distribution of Energy Assistance Funds (Exelon, BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL).\nOn June 15, 2021, the MDPSC issued an order authorizing the disbursal of funds to utilities in accordance with Maryland COVID-19 relief legislation. Under this order, BGE, Pepco, and DPL received funds of $\n50\nmillion, $\n12\nmillion, and $\n8\nmillion, respectively, in July 2021. The funds have been used to reduce or eliminate certain qualifying past-due residential customer receivables.\nEmPOWER Maryland Cost Recovery (Exelon, BGE, PHI, Pepco and DPL).\nOn December 29, 2023, the MDPSC issued an order authorizing the next three-year program cycle for EmPOWER Maryland and approved various proposals by the program administrators to implement new energy efficiency programs for the 2024-2026 program cycle, as well as continue operating core programs. Historically, BGE, Pepco, and DPL deferred most of their energy efficiency program costs to a regulatory asset and either deferred most of their demand response program costs to a regulatory asset or capitalized them. Beginning in 2024, BGE, Pepco, and DPL will begin deferring less energy efficiency and demand response program costs to a regulatory asset. Additionally, as part of the order, the MDPSC directed BGE, Pepco, and DPL to extend the amortization of unamortized costs as of December 31, 2023 from 5 to 7 years to mitigate customer bill impacts.\nDistrict of Columbia Regulatory Matters\nDistrict of Columbia Revenue Decoupling (Exelon, PHI, and Pepco).\nIn 2009, the DCPSC approved a BSA, which is a decoupling mechanism. As a result of the decoupling mechanism, Operating revenues from electric distribution at Pepco District of Columbia (see also Maryland Revenue Decoupling above for Pepco Maryland) are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer. The decoupling mechanism eliminates the impacts of abnormal weather or customer usage by recognizing revenues based on an authorized distribution amount per customer by customer class. Operating revenues from electric distribution at Pepco District of Columbia are, however, impacted by changes in the number of customers.\n175\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nNew Jersey Regulatory Matters\nConservation Incentive Program (CIP) (Exelon, PHI, and ACE).\nOn September 25, 2020, ACE filed an application with the NJBPU as was required seeking approval to implement a portfolio of energy efficiency programs pursuant to New Jersey’s clean energy legislation. The filing included a request to implement a CIP that would eliminate the favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and customer usage patterns on distribution revenues for most customers. The CIP compares current distribution revenues by customer class to approved target revenues established in ACE’s most recent distribution base rate case. The CIP is calculated annually and recovery is subject to certain conditions, including an earnings test and ceilings on customer rate increases.\nOn April 27, 2021, the NJBPU approved the settlement filed by ACE and the third parties to the proceeding. The approved settlement addresses all material aspects of ACE’s filing, including ACE’s ability to implement the CIP prospectively effective July 1, 2021. As a result of this decoupling mechanism, operating revenues will no longer be impacted by abnormal weather or usage for most customers. Starting in third quarter of 2021, ACE has recorded alternative revenue program revenues for its best estimate of the distribution revenue impacts resulting from future changes in CIP rates that it believes are probable of approval by the NJBPU in accordance with this mechanism.\nTermination of Energy Procurement Provisions of PPAs (Exelon, PHI, and ACE).\nOn December 22, 2021, ACE filed with the NJBPU a petition to terminate the provisions in the PPAs to purchase electricity from two coal-powered generation facilities located in the state of New Jersey. The petition was approved by the NJBPU on March 23, 2022. Upon closing of the transaction on March 31, 2022, ACE recognized a liability of $\n203\nmillion for the contract termination fee, which is to be paid by the end of 2024, and recognized a corresponding regulatory asset of\n$\n203\nmillion.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the $\n49\nmillion liability for the contract termination fee is included in Other current liabilities in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheet and PPA termination obligation in PHI's and ACE's Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, ACE has paid $\n88\nmillion and $\n66\nmillion of the liability, which is recorded in Changes in Other assets and liabilities in Exelon's, PHI's, and ACE's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nACE Infrastructure Investment Program Filings (Exelon, PHI, and ACE).\nOn February 28, 2018, ACE filed with the NJBPU the Registrants' IIP proposing to seek recovery of a series of investments through a new rider mechanism, totaling $\n338\nmillion, between 2019-2022 to provide safe and reliable service for its customers. The IIP will allow for more timely recovery of investments made to modernize and enhance ACE’s electric system. On April 15, 2019, ACE entered into a settlement agreement with other parties, which allows for a recovery totaling $\n96\nmillion of reliability related capital investments from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2023. On April 18, 2019, the NJBPU approved the settlement agreement.\nOn\nOctober 31, 2022, ACE filed with the NJBPU a second IIP, called “Powering the Future”, proposing to seek recovery through a new component of ACE’s rider mechanism, totaling $\n379\nmillion, over the four-year period of July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2027. The new IIP will allow ACE to invest in projects that are designed to enhance the reliability, resiliency, and safety of the service ACE provides to its customers.  On June 15, 2023, ACE entered into a settlement agreement with other parties, which allows for a recovery totaling $\n93\nmillion of reliability related capital investments from July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2027. ACE will have the option of seeking approval from the NJBPU to extend the end date of the IIP beyond June 30, 2027, if ACE determines an extension is necessary.  On June 29, 2023, the NJBPU adopted the settlement agreement and issued an order approving the program.\nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure Filing (Exelon, PHI, and ACE).\nOn August 26, 2020, ACE filed an application with the NJBPU as was required seeking approval to deploy a smart energy network in alignment with New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan and Clean Energy Act. The proposal consisted of estimated costs totaling $\n220\nmillion with deployment taking place over a 3-year implementation period from approximately 2021 to 2024 that involves the installation of an integrated system of smart meters for all customers accompanied by the requisite communications facilities and data management systems.\nOn July 14, 2021, the NJBPU approved the settlement filed by ACE and the third parties to the proceeding. The approved settlement addresses all material aspects of ACE's smart energy network deployment plan, including\n176\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\ncost recovery of the investment costs, incremental O&M expenses, and the unrecovered balance of existing infrastructure through future distribution rates.\nNew Jersey Clean Energy Legislation (Exelon, PHI, and ACE).\nOn May 23, 2018, New Jersey enacted legislation that established and modified New Jersey’s clean energy and energy efficiency programs and solar and RPS. On the same day, New Jersey enacted legislation that established a ZEC program that provides compensation for nuclear plants that demonstrate to the NJBPU that they meet certain requirements. Under the legislation, the NJBPU will issue ZECs to the qualifying nuclear power plants and the electric distribution utilities in New Jersey, including ACE, will be required to purchase those ZECs. ACE began collecting from retail distribution customers, through a non-bypassable charge, all costs associated with the procurement of the ZECs effective April 18, 2019.\nOther Federal Regulatory Matters\nFERC Audit (Exelon and ComEd).\nThe Utility Registrants are subject to periodic audits and investigations by FERC. FERC’s Division of Audits and Accounting initiated a nonpublic audit of ComEd in April 2021 evaluating ComEd’s compliance with (1) approved terms, rates and conditions of its federally regulated service; (2) accounting requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts; (3) reporting requirements of the FERC Form 1; and (4) the requirements for record retention. The audit period extends back to January 1, 2017. During the first quarter of  2023, ComEd was provided with information from FERC about several potential findings, including ComEd's methodology regarding the allocation of certain overhead costs to capital under FERC regulations. Based on the preliminary findings and discussions with FERC staff, ComEd determined that a loss was probable and recorded a regulatory liability to reflect its best estimate of that loss in the first quarter of 2023.\nOn July 27, 2023, FERC issued a final audit report which included, among other things, findings and recommendations related to ComEd's methodology regarding the allocation of certain overhead costs to capitalized construction costs under FERC regulations, including a suggestion that refunds may be due to customers for amounts collected in previous years. On August 28, 2023, ComEd filed a formal notice of the issues it will contest. On December 14, 2023, FERC appointed a settlement judge for the contested overhead allocation findings. The final outcome and resolution of any contested audit issues as well as a reasonable estimate of potential future losses cannot be accurately estimated at this stage; however, the final resolution of these matters could result in recognition of future losses, above the amounts currently accrued, that could be material to the Exelon and ComEd financial statements.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nRegulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates or represent billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs.\n177\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nThe following tables provide information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of the Registrants at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n178\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\n179\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\n180\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nDescriptions of the regulatory assets and liabilities included in the tables above are summarized below, including their recovery and amortization periods.\n181\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\n182\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\n183\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\n184\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\n185\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\n186\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\n187\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nDecommissioning the Regulatory Agreement Units\nThe regulatory agreements with the ICC and PAPUC dictate obligations related to the shortfall or excess of NDT funds necessary for decommissioning the former ComEd units on a unit-by-unit basis and the former PECO units in total.\nFor the former PECO units, given the symmetric settlement provisions that allow for continued recovery of decommissioning costs from PECO customers in the event of a shortfall and the obligation for Constellation to ultimately return excess funds to PECO customers (on an aggregate basis for all seven units), decommissioning-related activities prior to separation on February 1, 2022 were generally offset in Exelon’s Consolidated\n188\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Income with an offsetting adjustment to the regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets and an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from or payable to Generation at PECO. Following the separation, decommissioning-related activities result in an adjustment to the Receivable related to Regulatory Agreement Units and an equal adjustment to the regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets at PECO.\nFor the former ComEd units, given no further recovery from ComEd customers is permitted and Constellation retains an obligation to ultimately return excess funds to ComEd customers (on a unit-by-unit basis), to the extent excess funds are expected for each unit, decommissioning-related activities prior to separation on February 1, 2022  were offset in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income with an offsetting adjustment to regulatory liabilities and noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation at ComEd. Following the separation, decommissioning-related activities result in an adjustment to the Receivable related to Regulatory Agreement Units and an equal adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at ComEd. However, given the asymmetric settlement provision that does not allow for continued recovery from ComEd customers in the event of a shortfall, recognition of a regulatory asset at ComEd is not permissible.\nCapitalized Ratemaking Amounts Not Recognized\nThe following table presents authorized amounts capitalized for ratemaking purposes related to earnings on shareholders’ investment that are not recognized for financial reporting purposes in the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in the related Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the periods they are billable to the Utility Registrants' customers. PECO had\nno\nrelated amounts at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\n__________\n(a)\nReflects ComEd's unrecognized equity returns earned for ratemaking purposes on its energy efficiency and electric distribution formula rate regulatory assets.\n(b)\nBGE's amount capitalized for ratemaking purposes primarily relates to earnings on shareholders' investment on their AMI programs and on investments in rate base included in the multi-year plan reconciliations.\n(c)\nPepco's and DPL's authorized amounts capitalized for ratemaking purposes relate to earnings on shareholders' investment on their respective AMI programs and Energy efficiency and demand response programs, and for Pepco District of Columbia revenue decoupling program. The earnings on energy efficiency are on Pepco District of Columbia and DPL Delaware programs only.\n(d)\nACE's authorized amounts capitalized for ratemaking purposes primarily relate to earnings on shareholders' investment on AMI programs.\n4.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants recognize revenue from contracts with customers to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entities expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The primary sources of revenue include regulated electric and gas tariff sales, distribution, and transmission services. The performance obligations, revenue recognition, and payment terms associated with these sources of revenue are further discussed in the table below. There are no significant financing components for these sources of revenue and no variable consideration.\nUnless otherwise noted, for each of the significant revenue categories and related performance obligations described below, the Registrants have the right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value transferred to the customer for the performance completed to date. Therefore, the Registrants generally recognize revenue in the amount for which they have the right to invoice the customer. As a result, there are generally no significant judgments used in determining or allocating the transaction price.\n189\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n__________\n(a)\nElectric and natural gas utility customers have the choice to purchase electricity or natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. While the Utility Registrants are required under state legislation to bill their customers for the supply and distribution of electricity and/or natural gas, they recognize revenue related only to the distribution services when customers purchase their electricity or natural gas from competitive suppliers.\n(b)\nPassage of time is used for NITS and access to the wholesale grid and MWhs of energy transported over the wholesale grid is used for scheduling, system control and dispatch services.\nThe Utility Registrants do not incur any material costs to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers.\nContract Liabilities\nThe Registrants record contract liabilities when consideration is received or due prior to the satisfaction of the performance obligations. The Registrants record contract liabilities in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn July 1, 2020, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each entered into a collaborative arrangement (\"Agreement\") with an unrelated owner and manager of communication infrastructure (the \"Buyer\"). Under this arrangement, Pepco, DPL, and ACE sold a\n60\n% undivided interest in their respective portfolios of transmission tower attachment agreements with telecommunications companies to the Buyer, in addition to transitioning management of the day-to-day operations of the jointly-owned agreements to the Buyer for\n35\nyears, while retaining the safe and reliable operation of its utility assets. In return, Pepco, DPL, and ACE will provide the Buyer limited access on the portion of the towers where the equipment resides for the purposes of managing the agreements for the benefit of Pepco, DPL, ACE, and the Buyer. Pursuant to the Agreement, Pepco, DPL, and ACE have the option (\"Payment Option\"), but not obligation, to sell\ntwo\nadditional\n10\n% undivided interests in the tower attachment agreements to the Buyer for specified consideration. In addition, for an initial period of\nthree years\nand\ntwo\n,\ntwo-year\nextensions that are subject to certain conditions, the Buyer has the exclusive right to enter into new agreements with telecommunications companies and to receive a specified undivided percentage interest in those new agreements as set forth in the Agreement. Pepco, DPL, and ACE received cash and recorded contract liabilities as of July 1, 2020. The revenue attributable to this arrangement will be recognized as Electric operating revenues over the\n35\nyears under the Agreement.\n190\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, Pepco, DPL, and ACE entered into an amendment to the Agreement (“Amendment”) to modify the terms of the Payment Option and the conditions to exercise the exclusive right extensions. Concurrently, Pepco, DPL and ACE exercised both Payment Options which also triggered the extension of the exclusive right period until 2027. The Amendment and executed Payment Options represent a contract modification that is accounted for prospectively in accordance with authoritative guidance. Pepco, DPL and ACE received cash and recorded an increase to the contract liabilities as of December 31, 2023 as shown in the table below. The revenue will be recognized as Electric operating revenues over the remaining term of the Agreement (approximately\n31\nyears).\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the contract liabilities reflected in Exelon's, PHI's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE'S Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, ComEd's, PECO's, and BGE's contract liabilities were not material.\n__________\n(a)\nRevenues recognized in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were included in the contract liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nThe following table shows the amounts of future revenues expected to be recorded in each year for performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of December 31, 2023. This disclosure only includes contracts for which the total consideration is fixed and determinable at contract inception. The average contract term varies by customer type and commodity but ranges from one month to several years.\nThis disclosure excludes the Utility Registrants' gas and electric tariff sales contracts and transmission revenue contracts as they generally have an original expected duration of one year or less and, therefore, do not contain any future, unsatisfied performance obligations to be included in this disclosure.\nRevenue Disaggregation\nThe Registrants disaggregate revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. See Note 5 — Segment Information for the presentation of the Registrant's revenue disaggregation.\n5.\nSegment Information (All Registrants)\nOperating segments for each of the Registrants are determined based on information used by the CODMs in deciding how to evaluate performance and allocate resources at each of the Registrants.\n191\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 — Segment Information\nExelon has\nsix\nreportable segments, which include ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI's\nthree\nreportable segments consisting of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each represent a single reportable segment, and as such, no separate segment information is provided for these Registrants. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE's CODMs evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the segments based on net income.\nThe separation of Constellation Energy Corporation, including Generation and its subsidiaries, meets the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, results of operations are presented as discontinued operations and have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented. Furthermore, the reportable segment information related to the discontinued operations has been excluded from the tables presented below. See Note 2 — Discontinued Operations for additional information.\nAn analysis and reconciliation of the Registrants' reportable segment information to the respective information in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is as follows:\n192\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 — Segment Information\n193\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 — Segment Information\n__________\n(a)\nOther primarily includes Exelon’s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investment activities.\n(b)\nIncludes gross utility tax receipts from customers. The offsetting remittance of utility taxes to the governing bodies is recorded in Taxes other than income taxes in the Registrants’ Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note 22 — Supplemental Financial Information for additional information on total utility taxes.\n(c)\nSee Note 23 — Related Party Transactions for additional information on intersegment revenues.\n194\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 — Segment Information\nPHI:\n__________\n(a)\nOther primarily includes PHI’s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investment activities.\n195\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 — Segment Information\n(b)\nIncludes gross utility tax receipts from customers. The offsetting remittance of utility taxes to the governing bodies is recorded in Taxes other than income taxes in the Registrants’ Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note 22 — Supplemental Financial Information for additional information on total utility taxes.\n(c)\nIncludes intersegment revenues with ComEd, PECO, and BGE, which are eliminated at Exelon.\nElectric and Gas Revenue by Customer Class (Utility Registrants):\nThe following tables disaggregate the Registrants' revenues recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. For the Utility Registrants, the disaggregation of revenues reflects the two primary utility services of  electric sales and natural gas sales (where applicable), with further disaggregation of these tariff sales provided by major customer groups. Exelon's disaggregated revenues are consistent with the Utility Registrants, but exclude any intercompany revenues.\n196\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 — Segment Information\n197\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 — Segment Information\n__________\n(a)\nIncludes revenues from transmission revenue from PJM, wholesale electric revenue and mutual assistance revenue.\n(b)\nIncludes operating revenues from affiliates in 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively of:\n•\n$\n16\nmillion, $\n16\nmillion, and $\n41\nmillion at ComEd\n•\n$\n7\nmillion, $\n7\nmillion, and $\n20\nmillion at PECO\n•\n$\n6\nmillion, $\n7\nmillion, and $\n13\nmillion at BGE\n•\n$\n9\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion, and $\n13\nmillion at PHI\n•\n$\n9\nmillion, $\n5\nmillion, and $\n5\nmillion at Pepco\n•\n$\n8\nmillion, $\n6\nmillion, and $\n7\nmillion at DPL\n•\n$\n2\nmillion, $\n2\nmillion, and $\n2\nmillion at ACE\n(c)\nIncludes revenues from off-system natural gas sales.\n(d)\nIncludes operating revenues from affiliates in 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively of:\n•\n$\n2\nmillion, less than $1 million, and $\n1\nmillion at PECO\n•\n$\n3\nmillion, $\n8\nmillion, and $\n18\nmillion at BGE\n(e)\nIncludes late payment charge revenues.\n6.\nAccounts Receivable (All Registrants)\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Accounts Receivable\nThe following tables present the rollforward of Allowance for credit losses on Customer accounts receivable.\n_________\n(a)\nFor ComEd, the change in current period provision for expected credit losses is primarily a result of increased receivable balances.\n(b)\nFor BGE, DPL and ACE, the change in current period provision for expected credit losses is primarily a result of decreased receivable balances.\n(c)\nFor Pepco the change in current period provision for expected credit losses is primarily a result of receivables increasing at a slower pace versus the prior period.\n(d)\nFor PECO and BGE the change in write-offs is primarily a result of increased disconnection activities.\n(e)\nFor PHI, ACE, and Pepco, write-offs are primarily attributable to the termination of the moratorium in the service territory for each operating company, which beginning in 2020, prevented customer disconnections for non-payment. Disconnection activities across the service territories resumed from September 2020 through January 2022, resulting in write-offs of aged accounts receivable.\n(f)\nFor DPL, the change in write-offs is primarily attributable to unfavorable customer payment behavior.\n(g)\nRecoveries were not material to the Registrants.\nThe following tables present the rollforward of Allowance for credit losses on Other accounts receivable.\n198\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 6 — Accounts Receivable\n_________\n(a)\nRecoveries were not material to the Registrants.\nUnbilled Customer Revenue\nThe following table provides additional information about unbilled customer revenues recorded in the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n_________\n(a)\nUnbilled customer revenues are classified in Customer accounts receivables, net in the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther Purchases of Customer and Other Accounts Receivables\nThe Utility Registrants are required, under separate legislation and regulations in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, District of Columbia, and New Jersey, to purchase certain receivables from alternative retail electric and, as applicable, natural gas suppliers that participate in the utilities' consolidated billing.\nThe following tables present the total receivables purchased.\n_________\n(a)\nIncludes $\n4\nmillion of receivables purchased from Generation prior to the separation on February 1, 2022 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n199\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 7 — Property, Plant, and Equipment\n7.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment (All Registrants)\nThe following tables present a summary of property, plant, and equipment by asset category at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n__________\n(a)\nPrimarily composed of land and non-utility property.\n200\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 7 — Property, Plant, and Equipment\nThe following table presents the average service life for each asset category in number of years:\nThe following table presents the annual depreciation rates for each asset category.\nAFUDC\nThe following table summarizes credits to AFUDC by year:\nSee Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies for additional information regarding property, plant and equipment policies.

PECO, DPL, and ACE also own a\n42.55\n%,\n7.45\n%, and\n7.45\n% share, respectively, in\n2.5\nmiles of 500kV line located over the Delaware River. ACE also has a\n21.78\n% share in a 500kV New Freedom Switching substation.\nCertain facilities are fully owned by Exelon through its\n100\n% ownership in PECO, DPL, and ACE. These facilities are operated by Exelon Registrants. PECO's, DPL's, and ACE's material undivided ownership interests in Exelon owned facilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nPECO's, DPL's, and ACE's undivided ownership interests presented in the tables above are financed with their funds and all operations are accounted for as if such participating interests were wholly owned facilities. PECO's, DPL's, and ACE's share of direct expenses of the jointly owned plants are included in Operating and maintenance expenses in Exelon's, PECO's, PHI's, DPL's, and ACE's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n202\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 9 — Asset Retirement Obligations\n9.\nAsset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants have AROs primarily associated with the abatement and disposal of equipment and buildings contaminated with asbestos and PCBs. See Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the Registrants’ accounting policy for AROs.\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the AROs reflected in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2023:\n__________\n(a)\nFor ComEd, PECO, BGE, DPL and ACE, the majority of the accretion is recorded as an increase to a regulatory asset due to the associated regulatory treatment.\n10.\nLeases\n(All Registrants)\nLessee\nThe Registrants have operating and finance leases for which they are the lessees.\nThe following tables outline the significant types of leases at each of the Registrants and other terms and conditions of the lease agreements as of December 31, 2023. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, and BGE did not have material finance leases in 2023, 2022, or 2021.\n203\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 — Leases\nThe components of operating lease costs were as follows:\n__________\n(a)\nExcludes sublease income recorded at Exelon, PHI, and DPL of $\n4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nThe components of financing lease costs were as follows:\nThe following tables provide additional information regarding the presentation of operating and finance lease ROU assets and lease liabilities within the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n204\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 — Leases\n205\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 — Leases\nFuture minimum lease payments for operating and finance leases as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nThe weighted average remaining lease terms, in years, for operating and finance leases were as follows:\nThe weighted average discount rates for operating and finance leases were as follows:\n206\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 — Leases\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating and finance lease liabilities were as follows:\nROU assets obtained in exchange for operating and finance lease obligations were as follows:\nLessor\nThe Registrants have operating leases for which they are the lessors.\nThe following tables outline the significant types of leases at each of the Registrants and other terms and conditions of their lease agreements as of December 31, 2023.

BGE determined that the carrying value was not recoverable and that its fair value was less than carrying value. As a result, in 2022, a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n48\nmillion was recorded in Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon’s and BGE’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The fair value used in the analysis was based on an estimate of an expected sales price. The office building met all of the criteria for classification as held for sale as of December 31, 2023, and therefore is reported within Other current assets in Exelon’s and BGE’s Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023.\n12.\nIntangible Assets\nGoodwill (Exelon, ComEd, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE)\nThe following table presents the gross amount, accumulated impairment loss, and carrying amount of Goodwill at Exelon, ComEd, and PHI at December 31, 2023 and 2022. There were\nno\nadditions or impairments during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n__________\n(a)\nReflects goodwill recorded in 2000 from the PECO/Unicom merger (predecessor parent company of ComEd).\n(b)\nReflects goodwill recorded in 2016 from the PHI merger.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an assessment for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of ComEd's and PHI's reporting units below their carrying amounts. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is assessed for impairment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and its operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. ComEd has a single operating segment. PHI's operating segments are Pepco, DPL, and ACE. See Note 5 — Segment Information for additional information. There is no level below these operating segments for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. Therefore, the ComEd, Pepco, DPL, and ACE operating segments are also considered reporting units for goodwill impairment assessment purposes. Exelon's and ComEd's $\n2.6\nbillion of goodwill has been assigned entirely to the ComEd reporting unit, while Exelon's and PHI's $\n4.0\nbillion of goodwill has been assigned to the Pepco, DPL, and ACE reporting units in the amounts of $\n2.1\nbillion, $\n1.4\nbillion, and $\n0.5\nbillion, respectively.\nEntities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. As part of the qualitative assessments, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI evaluate, among other things, management's best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for their businesses, outcomes of recent regulatory proceedings, changes in certain market conditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility peer EBITDA multiples, and the passing margin from their last quantitative assessments performed. If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment, a quantitative, fair value-based assessment is performed, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the entity recognizes an impairment charge, which is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment assessment requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market\n209\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 12 — Intangible Assets\nperformance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's businesses, and the fair value of debt.\n2023 and 2022 Goodwill Impairment Assessment.\nComEd and PHI qualitatively determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of their reporting units exceeded their carrying values and, therefore, did not perform quantitative assessments as of November 1, 2023 and 2022. The last quantitative assessments performed for PHI was as of November 1, 2018.  On December 14, 2023, due to the issuance of the ICC's final order rejecting ComEd’s proposed Grid Plan and establishing retail rates for 2024-2027 as further discussed in Note 3 — Regulatory Matters, Exelon’s stock price decreased approximately\n10\n% triggering an interim quantitative assessment for potential goodwill impairment at ComEd. ComEd performed a quantitative assessment as of December 31, 2023, comparing the estimated fair value of ComEd to its carrying value, and determined there was no indication of goodwill impairment.\nWhile the annual and interim assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used to estimate reporting unit fair values are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon's, ComEd's, and PHI’s goodwill, which could be material.\nOther Intangible Assets and Liabilities (Exelon and PHI)\nExelon’s other intangible assets, included in Other current assets and Other deferred debits and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the following at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Exelon's and PHI's other intangible liabilities, included in current and noncurrent Unamortized energy contract liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the following at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The intangible assets and liabilities shown below are amortized on a straight-line basis, except for unamortized energy contracts which are amortized in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows:\nThe following table summarizes the amortization expense related to intangible assets and liabilities for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n__________\n(a)\nFor PHI unamortized energy contracts, the amortization of the fair value adjustment amounts and the corresponding offsetting regulatory asset amounts are amortized through Purchased power and fuel expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income resulting in no effect to net income.\n(b)\nOn March 23, 2022, the NJBPU approved a petition by ACE to terminate the provisions in its PPAs. As such, the contract was fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Negative percentages represent income tax benefit.\n(b)\nFor PECO, the lower effective tax rate is primarily related to plant basis differences attributable to tax repair deductions.\n(c)\nFor Exelon, the lower state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, is primarily due to the long-term marginal state income tax rate change of $\n54\nmillion.\n(d)\nFor PECO, the lower effective tax rate is primarily related to plant basis differences attributable to tax repair deductions partially offset by higher state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, related to a one-time expense of $\n38\nmillion  attributable to the change in the Pennsylvania corporate income tax rate. For BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE, the lower effective tax rate is primarily related to the acceleration of certain income tax benefits due to transmission and distribution rate case settlements.\n212\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 13 — Income Taxes\n(e)\nFor Exelon, the higher state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, is primarily due to the long-term marginal state income tax rate change of $\n67\nmillion and the recognition of a valuation allowance of $\n40\nmillion against the net deferred tax asset position for certain standalone state filing jurisdictions, partially offset by a one-time impact associated with a state tax benefit of $\n43\nmillion and indemnification adjustments pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement of $\n11\nmillion as a result of the separation. For PECO, the higher state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, related to a one-time expense of $\n38\nmillion attributable to the change in the Pennsylvania corporate income tax rate.\n(f)\nFor Exelon, reflects the income tax expense related to the write-off of federal tax credits subject to recapture of $\n15\nmillion as a result of the separation.\n(g)\nFor Exelon, reflects the nondeductible transaction costs of approximately $\n12\nmillion arising as part of the separation and indemnification adjustments pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement of $\n9\nmillion.\n(h)\nFor PECO, the lower effective tax rate is primarily related to plant basis differences attributable to tax repair deductions. For BGE, the income tax benefit is primarily due to the Maryland multi-year plan which resulted in the acceleration of certain income tax benefits. For Pepco, the lower effective tax rate is primarily related to the acceleration of certain income tax benefits due to transmission and distribution rate case settlements. For DPL, the higher effective tax rate is primarily related to a state income tax expense, net of federal income tax benefit, due to the recognition of a valuation allowance of approximately $\n31\nmillion against a deferred tax asset associated with Delaware net operating loss carryforwards as a result of a change in Delaware tax law. For ACE, the income tax benefit is primarily due to a distribution rate case settlement which allows ACE to retain certain tax benefits.\nTax Differences and Carryforwards\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards, which give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets (liabilities), at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented below:\n213\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 13 — Income Taxes\nThe following table provides Exelon’s, ComEd's, PECO’s, BGE’s, PHI’s, Pepco’s, DPL’s, and ACE’s carryforwards, of which the state related items are presented on a post-apportioned basis, as well as, any corresponding valuation allowances at December 31, 2023.\n__________\n(a)\nFor Exelon, the federal net operating loss carryforward has an indefinite carryforward period.\n(b)\nFor Exelon, the federal general business credit carryforward will begin expiring in 2035.\n(c)\nFor Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, DPL and ACE, the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax credit carryforward has an indefinite carryforward period.\n214\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 13 — Income Taxes\n(d)\nFor Exelon, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against certain separate company state net operating loss carryforwards that are expected to expire before realization. For PECO, a valuation allowance has been recorded against certain Pennsylvania net operating losses that are expected to expire before realization. For DPL, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against Delaware net operating losses carryforwards due to a change in Delaware tax law that restricts the ability for corporate taxpayers to monetize net operating losses.\n(e)\nA portion of Exelon's, BGE's, and DPL's Maryland state net operating loss carryforward have an indefinite carryforward period.\nTabular Reconciliation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe following table presents changes in unrecognized tax benefits, for Exelon, PHI, and ACE. ComEd's, PECO's, BGE's, Pepco's, and DPL's amounts are not material.\n______\n(a)\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, Exelon recorded a receivable of $\n31\nmillion and $\n50\nmillion, respectively, in noncurrent Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for Constellation’s share of unrecognized tax benefits for periods prior to the separation.\nRecognition of Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe following table presents Exelon's unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would decrease the effe\nctive tax rate. The Utility Registrants' amounts are not material.\nUnrecognized tax benefits for which significant increases or decreases are possible within 12 months after the reporting date\nAt December 31, 2023, ACE has approximately $\n14\nmillion of unrecognized state tax benefits that could significantly decrease within the 12 months after the reporting date based on the outcome of pending court cases involving other taxpayers. The unrecognized tax benefit, if recognized, may be included in future base rates and that portion would have no impact to the effective tax rate.\n215\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 13 — Income Taxes\nTotal Amounts of Interest and Penalties Recognized\nThe following table represents the net interest and penalties receivable (payable) related to tax positions reflected in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Utility Registrants' amounts are not material.\n__________\n(a)\nAt December 31, 2023, Exelon classified $\n21\nmillion and $\n41\nmillion of the interest receivable as current and noncurrent, respectively, based on the expected timing for settlement in cash. At December 31, 2023, Exelon recorded a receivable of $\n5\nmillion in noncurrent Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for Constellation's share of net interest for periods prior to the separation.\n(b)\nAt December 31, 2022, the interest receivable balance is not expected to be settled in cash within the next twelve months and is therefore classified as a noncurrent receivable. At December 31, 2022, Exelon recorded a receivable of $\n1\nmillion in noncurrent Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for Constellation's share of net interest for periods prior to the separation.\nThe Registrants did not record material interest and penalty expense related to tax positions reflected in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest expense and penalty expense are recorded in Interest expense, net and Other, net, respect\nively, in Other income and deductions in the Registrants Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nDescription of Tax Years Open to Assessment by Major Jurisdiction\n__________\n(a)\nCertain registrants are only open to assessment for tax years since joining the Exelon federal consolidated group; BGE beginning in 2012 and PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE beginning in 2016.\nOther Tax Matters\nSeparation (Exelon)\nIn the first quarter of 2022, in connection with the separation, Exelon recorded an income tax expense related to continuing operations of $\n148\nmillion primarily due to the long-term marginal state income tax rate change of $\n54\nmillion discussed further below, the recognition of valuation allowances of approximately $\n40\nmillion against the net deferred tax assets positions for certain standalone state filing jurisdictions, the write-off of federal and state tax credits subject to recapture of $\n17\nmillion, and nondeductible transaction costs for federal and state taxes of $\n24\nmillion.\nTax Matters Agreement (Exelon)\nIn connection with the separation, Exelon entered into a TMA with Constellation. The TMA governs the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations between Exelon and Constellation after the separation with respect to tax liabilities, refunds and attributes for open tax years that Constellation was part of Exelon’s consolidated group for U.S. federal, state, and local tax purposes.\n216\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 13 — Income Taxes\nIndemnification for Taxes.\nAs a former subsidiary of Exelon, Constellation has joint and several liability with Exelon to the IRS and certain state jurisdictions relating to the taxable periods prior to the separation. The TMA specifies that Constellation is liable for their share of taxes required to be paid by Exelon with respect to taxable periods prior to the separation to the extent Constellation would have been responsible for such taxes under the existing Exelon tax sharing agreement. In 2023, Exelon remitted $\n9\nmillion of payments to Constellation. At December 31, 2023, Exelon recorded a payable of $\n11\nmillion in Other current liabilities that is due to Constellation.\nTax Refunds.\nThe TMA specifies that Constellation is entitled to their share of any future tax refunds claimed by Exelon with respect to taxable periods prior to the separation to the extent that Constellation would have received such tax refunds under the existing Exelon tax sharing agreement.\nTax Attributes\n. At the date of separation certain tax attributes, primarily pre-closing tax credit carryforwards, that were generated by Constellation were required by law to be allocated to Exelon. The TMA also provides that Exelon will reimburse Constellation when those allocated tax attribute carryforwards are utilized. In 2023, Exelon remitted $\n21\nmillion of payments to Constellation for the utilization of pre-closing tax credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2023, Exelon recorded a payable of $\n182\nmillion and $\n331\nmillion in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for tax attribute carryforwards that are expected to be utilized and reimbursed to Constellation.\nCorporate Alternative Minimum Tax (All Registrants)\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law and implemented a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) that imposes a\n15.0\n% tax on modified GAAP net income. Corporations are entitled to a tax credit (minimum tax credit) to the extent the CAMT liability exceeds the regular tax liability. This amount can be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years when regular tax exceeds the CAMT.\nBased on the existing statue, Exelon and each of the Utility Registrants will be subject to and will report the CAMT on a separate Registrant basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred tax asset related to the minimum tax credit carryforward will be realized to the extent Exelon’s consolidated deferred tax liabilities exceed the minimum tax credit carryforward. Exelon’s deferred tax liabilities are expected to exceed the minimum tax credit carryforward for the foreseeable future and thus\nno\nvaluation allowance is required. Exelon is continuing to assess the financial statement impacts of the IRA and will update estimates based on future guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury.\nLong-Term Marginal State Income Tax Rate (All Registrants)\nQuarterly, Exelon reviews and updates its marginal state income tax rates for material changes in state tax laws and state apportionment. The Registrants remeasure their existing deferred income tax balances to reflect the changes in marginal rates, which results in either an increase or a decrease to their net deferred income tax liability balances. Utility Registrants record corresponding regulatory liabilities or assets to the extent such amounts are probable of settlement or recovery through customer rates and an adjustment to income tax expense for all other amounts. In the third quarter of 2023, Exelon updated its marginal state income tax rates for changes in state apportionment. The changes in marginal rates in the third quarter resulted in a decrease of $\n54\nmillion to the deferred tax liability at Exelon, and a corresponding adjustment to income tax expense, net of federal taxes.\nThere were no impacts to ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nPennsylvania Corporate Income Tax Rate Change (Exelon and PECO)\nOn July 8, 2022, Pennsylvania enacted House Bill 1342, which will permanently reduce the corporate income tax rate from\n9.99\n% to\n4.99\n%. The tax rate will be reduced to\n8.99\n% for the 2023 tax year. Starting with the 2024 tax year, the rate is reduced by\n0.50\n% annually until it reaches\n4.99\n% in 2031. As a result of the rate change, in the\n217\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 13 — Income Taxes\nthird quarter of 2022, Exelon and PECO recorded a one-time decrease to deferred income taxes of $\n390\nmillion with a corresponding decrease to the deferred income taxes regulatory asset of $\n428\nmillion for the amounts that are expected to be settled through future customer rates and an increase to income tax expense of $\n38\nmillion (net of federal taxes). The tax rate decrease is not expected to have a material ongoing impact to Exelon’s and PECO’s financial statements. There were no changes to PECO's marginal state income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021.\nAllocation of Tax Benefits (All Registrants)\nThe Utility Registrants are party to an agreement with Exelon and other subsidiaries of Exelon that provides for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits (Tax Sharing Agreement). The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax. In addition, any net federal and state benefits attributable to Exelon are reallocated to the other Registrants. That allocation is treated as a contribution from Exelon to the party receiving the benefit.\nThe following table presents the allocation of tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n__________\n(a)\nBGE and DPL did not record an allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss.\n(b)\nBGE did not record an allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss.\n(c)\nBGE, DPL, and ACE did not record an allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss.\n14.\nRetirement Benefits (All Registrants)\nExelon sponsors defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.  Substantially all non-union employees and electing union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective January 1, 2009, substantially all newly-hired union-represented employees participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective February 1, 2018 for most newly-hired BSC non-represented, non-craft, employees, January 1, 2021 for most newly-hired utility management employees, and for certain newly-hired union employees pursuant to their collective bargaining agreements, these newly-hired employees are not eligible for pension benefits, and will instead be eligible to receive an enhanced non-discretionary employer contribution in an Exelon defined contribution savings plan. Effective January 1, 2018, most newly-hired non-represented, non-craft, employees are not eligible for OPEB benefits and employees represented by Local 614 are not eligible for retiree health care benefits. Effective January 1, 2021, most non-represented, non-craft, employees who are under the age of 40 are not eligible for retiree health care benefits. Effective January 1, 2022, management employees retiring on or after that date are no longer eligible for retiree life insurance benefits.\nEffective February 1, 2022, in connection with the separation, pension and OPEB obligations and assets for current and former employees of the Constellation business and certain other former employees of Exelon and its subsidiaries transferred to pension and OPEB plans and trusts maintained by Constellation or its subsidiaries. The Exelon New England Union Employees Pension Plan and Constellation Mystic Power, LLC Union Employees Pension Plan Including Plan A and Plan B were transferred. The following OPEB plans were also transferred: Constellation Mystic Power, LLC Post-Employment Medical Savings Account Plan; Exelon New England Union Post-Employment Medical Savings Account Plan; and the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, LLC Medical Care and Prescription Drug Plan for Retired Employees.\nAs a result of the separation, Exelon restructured certain of its qualified pension plans. Pension obligations and assets for current and former employees continuing with Exelon and who were participants in the Exelon Employee Pension Plan for Clinton, TMI, and Oyster Creek, Pension Plan of Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC, and Nine Mile Point Pension Plan were merged into the Pension Plan of Constellation Energy\n218\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nGroup, Inc, which was subsequently renamed, Exelon Pension Plan (EPP). Exelon employees who participated in these plans prior to the separation now participate in the EPP. The merging of the plans did not change the benefits offered to the plan participants and, thus, had no impact on Exelon's pension obligations.\nThe tables below show the pension and OPEB plans in which current and former employees of each operating company participated as of December 31, 2023:\n__________\n(a)\nEmployees generally remain in their legacy benefit plans when transferring between operating companies.\n219\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nExelon’s traditional and cash balance pension plans are intended to be tax-qualified defined benefit plans. Exelon has elected that the trusts underlying these plans be treated as qualified trusts under the IRC. If certain conditions are met, Exelon can deduct payments made to the qualified trusts, subject to certain IRC limitations.\nBenefit Obligations, Plan Assets, and Funded Status\nAs of February 1, 2022, in connection with the separation, Exelon's pension and OPEB plans were remeasured. The remeasurement and separation resulted in a decrease to the Pension obligation, net of plan assets, of $\n921\nmillion and a decrease to the OPEB obligation of $\n893\nmillion. Additionally, AOCI decreased by $\n1,994\nmillion (after-tax) and Regulatory assets and liabilities increased by $\n14\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion, respectively. Key assumptions were held consistent with the year end December 31, 2021 assumptions with the exception of the discount rate.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, Exelon received an updated valuation of its pension and OPEB to reflect actual census data as of January 1, 2023. This valuation resulted in an increase to the pension obligation of $\n27\nmillion and an increase to the OPEB obligations of $\n2\nmillion. Additionally, AOCI increased by $\n10\nmillion (after-tax) and Regulatory assets and liabilities increased by $\n18\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion, respectively.\nThe following tables provide a rollforward of the changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets of Exelon for the most recent two years for all plans combined:\n__________\n(a)\nThe pension and OPEB losses in 2023  primarily reflect a decrease in the discount rate. The pension and OPEB gains in  2022 primarily reflect an increase in the discount rate.\n220\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nExelon presents its benefit obligations and plan assets net on its Consolidated Balance Sheets within the following line items:\nThe following table provides the ABO and fair value of plan assets for all pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan assets. Information for pension and OPEB plans with projected benefit obligations (PBO) and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO), respectively, in excess of plan assets has been disclosed in the Obligations and Plan Assets table above as all pension and OPEB plans are underfunded.\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Costs\nThe majority of the 2023 pension benefit cost for the Exelon-sponsored plans is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of\n7.00\n% and a discount rate of\n5.53\n%. The majority of the 2023 OPEB cost is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of\n6.50\n% for funded plans and a discount rate of\n5.51\n%.\nA portion of the net periodic benefit cost for all plans is capitalized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents the components of Exelon’s net periodic benefit costs, prior to capitalization, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n221\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nCost Allocation to Exelon Subsidiaries\nAll Registrants account for their participation in Exelon’s pension and OPEB plans by applying multi-employer accounting. Exelon allocates costs related to its pension and OPEB plans to its subsidiaries based on both active and retired employee participation in each plan.\nThe amounts below represent the Registrants' allocated pension and OPEB costs (benefit). For Exelon, the service cost component is included in Operating and maintenance expense and Property, plant, and equipment, net while the non-service cost components are included in Other, net and Regulatory assets. For the Utility Registrants, the service cost and non-service cost components are included in Operating and maintenance expense and Property, plant, and equipment, net in their consolidated financial statements.\nComponents of AOCI and Regulatory Assets\nExelon recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with offsetting entries to AOCI and Regulatory assets (liabilities). A portion of current year actuarial (gains) losses and prior service costs (credits) is capitalized in Exelon’s Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the expected regulatory recovery of these amounts, which would otherwise be recorded to AOCI.\nThe following tables provide the components of AOCI and Regulatory assets (liabilities) for Exelon for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 for all plans combined. The tables include amounts related to Generation prior to the separation.\n222\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nThe following table provides the components of gross AOCI and Regulatory assets (liabilities) for Exelon that have not been recognized as components of periodic benefit cost as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for all plans combined:\nAverage Remaining Service Period\nFor pension benefits, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs (credits) and certain actuarial (gains) losses, as applicable, based on participants’ average remaining service periods.\nFor OPEB, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs (credits) over participants’ average remaining service period to benefit eligibility age and amortizes certain actuarial (gains) losses over participants’ average remaining service period to expected retirement. The resulting average remaining service periods for pension and OPEB were as follows:\nAssumptions\nThe measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under Exelon’s defined benefit and OPEB plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and inputs and accounting policy elections. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is impacted by several assumptions and inputs, as shown below, among other factors. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations.\nExpected Rate of Return.\nIn determining the EROA, Exelon considers historical economic indicators (including inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectations regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon’s target asset class allocations.\nMortality\n. The mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, Exelon’s mortality assumption utilizes the SOA 2019 base table (Pri-2012) and MP-2021 improvement scale adjusted to use Proxy SSA ultimate improvement rates.\nFor Exelon, the following assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations for the plans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Assumptions used to determine year-end benefit obligations are the assumptions used to estimate the subsequent year’s net periodic benefit costs.\n223\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\n__________\n(a)\nThe discount rates above represent the blended rates used to determine the majority of Exelon’s pension and OPEB obligations. Certain benefit plans used individual rates, which range from\n5.11\n% -\n5.27\n% and\n5.15\n% -\n5.17\n% for pension and OPEB plans, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and\n5.46\n% -\n5.60\n% and\n5.49\n% -\n5.51\n% for pension and OPEB plans, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\n(b)\nThe investment crediting rate above represents a weighted average rate.\nThe following assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for Exelon for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n__________\n(a)\nThe discount rates above represent the blended rates used to establish the majority of Exelon’s pension and OPEB costs.  Certain benefit plans used individual rates, which range from\n5.46\n%-\n5.60\n% and\n5.49\n%-\n5.51\n% for pension and OPEB plans, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023;\n2.55\n%-\n3.24\n% and\n2.84\n%-\n3.20\n% for pension and OPEB plans; respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022; and\n2.11\n%-\n2.73\n% and\n2.45\n%-\n2.63\n% for pension and OPEB plans, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n(b)\nThe investment crediting rate above represents a weighted average rate.\n(c)\nNot applicable to pension and OPEB plans that do not have plan assets.\nContributions\nExelon allocates contributions related to its ECRP and PPBU pension plans and East and West OPEB plans to its subsidiaries based on accounting cost. For the EPP pension plan, PHI Qualified, and PHI PRW plans, pension and OPEB contributions are allocated to the subsidiaries based on employee participation (both active and retired). For Exelon, in connection with the separation, additional qualified pension contributions of $\n207\nmillion and $\n33\nmillion were completed on February 1, 2022 and March 2, 2022, respectively.\nThe following table provides contributions to the pension and OPEB plans:\n224\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nManagement considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \"Act\"), management of the pension obligation, and regulatory implications. The Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). The projected contributions below reflect a funding strategy to make annual contributions with the objective of achieving 100% funded status on an ABO basis over time. This funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions. Based on this funding strategy and current market conditions, which are subject to change, Exelon’s estimated annual qualified pension contributions will be approximately $\n93\nmillion in 2024. Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon’s non-qualified pension plans are not funded, given they are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements.\nWhile OPEB plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, Exelon does fund certain of its plans. For Exelon's funded OPEB plans, contributions generally equal accounting costs, however, Exelon’s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its OPEB plans, including liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid, and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery). The amounts below include benefit payments related to unfunded plans.\nThe following table provides all Registrants' planned contributions to the qualified pension plans, planned benefit payments to non-qualified pension plans, and planned contributions to OPEB plans in 2024:\n225\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nEstimated future benefit payments to participants in all of the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2023 were:\nPlan Assets\nInvestment Strategy.\nOn a regular basis, Exelon evaluates its investment strategy to ensure plan assets will be sufficient to pay plan benefits when due. As part of this ongoing evaluation, Exelon may make changes to its targeted asset allocation and investment strategy.\nExelon has developed and implemented a liability hedging investment strategy for its qualified pension plans that has reduced the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. Exelon is likely to continue to gradually increase the liability hedging portfolio as the funded status of its plans improves. The overall objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns that will balance the liquidity requirements of the plans’ liabilities while striving to minimize the risk of significant losses. Trust assets for Exelon’s OPEB plans are managed in a diversified investment strategy that prioritizes maximizing liquidity and returns while minimizing asset volatility.\nActual asset returns have an impact on the costs reported for the Exelon-sponsored pension and OPEB plans. The actual asset returns across Exelon’s pension and OPEB plans for the year ended December 31, 2023 were\n7.73\n% and\n9.20\n%, respectively, compared to an expected long-term return assumption of\n7.00\n% and\n6.50\n%, respectively. Exelon used an EROA of\n7.00\n% and\n6.50\n% to estimate its 2024 pension and OPEB costs, respectively.\nExelon’s pension and OPEB plan target asset allocations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n__________\n(a)\nAlternative investments include private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and private credit.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk.\nExelon evaluated its pension and OPEB plans’ asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2023. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund. As of December 31, 2023, there were\nno\nsignificant concentrations (defined as greater than 10% of plan assets) of risk in Exelon’s pension and OPEB plan assets.\n226\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nFair Value Measurements\nThe following tables present pension and OPEB plan assets measured and recorded at fair value in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n227\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\n__________\n(a)\nSee Note 17—Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for a description of levels within the fair value hierarchy.\n(b)\nIncludes derivative instruments of $\n51\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which have total notional amounts of $\n3,351\nmillion and $\n3,434\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The notional principal amounts for these instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of the fiscal years ended and do not represent the amount of Exelon's exposure to credit or market loss.\n(c)\nExcludes net liabilities of $\n388\nmillion and $\n318\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which include certain derivative assets that have notional amounts of $\n59\nmillion and $\n69\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These items are required to reconcile to the fair value of net plan assets and consist primarily of receivables or payables related to pending securities sales and purchases, interest and dividends receivable, and repurchase agreement obligations. The repurchase agreements generally have maturities ranging from\n3\n-\n6\nmonths.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities for Exelon measured at fair value for pension and OPEB plans for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n__________\n(a)\nRepresents cash settlements only.\n(b)\nIn 2022, transfers relate to changes in investment structure for certain investments due to the separation.\nValuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value\nThe techniques used to fair value the pension and OPEB assets invested in cash equivalents are the same as the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of financial assets. See Cash Equivalents in Note 17 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for further information. Below outlines the techniques used to fair value the pension and OPEB assets invested in equities, fixed income, derivatives, private credit, private equity, and real estate investments.\nEquities.\nThese investments consist of individually held equity securities, equity mutual funds, and equity commingled funds in domestic and foreign markets. With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are generally obtained from direct feeds from market\n228\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nexchanges, which Exelon is able to independently corroborate. Equity securities held individually, including real estate investment trusts, rights, and warrants, are primarily traded on exchanges that contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges. The equity securities that are held directly by the trust funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level 1. Certain equity securities have been categorized as Level 2 because they are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities. Certain private placement equity securities are categorized as Level 3 because they are not publicly traded and are priced using significant unobservable inputs.\nEquity commingled funds and mutual funds are maintained by investment companies, and fund investments are held in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For equity commingled funds and mutual funds that are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets on the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments can typically be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions.\nFixed income.\nFor fixed income securities, which consist primarily of corporate debt securities, U.S. government securities, foreign government securities, municipal bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities, commingled funds, mutual funds, and derivative instruments, the trustees obtain multiple prices from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class, or issue for each security. With respect to individually held fixed income securities, the trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine another price source is considered to be preferable. Exelon has obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Exelon selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain private placement fixed income securities have been categorized as Level 3 because they are priced using certain significant unobservable inputs and are typically illiquid. The remaining fixed income securities, including certain other fixed income investments, are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized as Level 2.\nOther fixed income investments primarily consist of fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds, which are maintained by investment companies and hold fund investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds that are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically can be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions.\nDerivative instruments.\nThese instruments, consisting primarily of futures and swaps to manage risk, are recorded at fair value. Over-the-counter derivatives are valued daily, based on quoted prices in active markets and trade in open markets, and have been categorized as Level 1. Derivative instruments other than over-the-counter derivatives are valued based on external price data of comparable securities and have been categorized as Level 2.\nPrivate credit.\nPrivate credit investments primarily consist of investments in private debt strategies. These investments are generally less liquid assets with an underlying term of 3 to 5 years and are intended to be held to maturity. The fair value of these investments is determined by the fund manager or administrator using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models, and income models and typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan. For managed private credit funds, the fair value is determined using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models, and income models and typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan. Managed private credit fund investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient.\n229\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nPrivate equity.\nThese investments include those in limited partnerships that invest in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange such as leveraged buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments, and investments in natural resources. These investments typically cannot be redeemed and are generally liquidated over a period of 8 to 10 years from the initial investment date, which is based on Exelon's understanding of the investment funds. Private equity valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include unobservable inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows, and market based comparable data. These valuation inputs are unobservable. The fair value of private equity investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nReal estate.\nThese investments are funds with a direct investment in pools of real estate properties. These funds are reported by the fund manager and are generally based on independent appraisals of the underlying investments from sources with professional qualifications, typically using a combination of market based comparable data and discounted cash flows. These valuation inputs are unobservable. Certain real estate investments cannot be redeemed and are generally liquidated over a period of 8 to 10 years from the initial investment date, which is based on Exelon's understanding of the investment funds. The remaining liquid real estate investments are generally redeemable from the investment vehicle quarterly, with 30 to 90 days of notice. The fair value of real estate investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nPension and OPEB assets also include investments in hedge funds. Hedge fund investments include those that employ a broad range of strategies to enhance returns and provide additional diversification. The fair value of hedge funds is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, hedge funds are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. Exelon has the ability to redeem these investments at NAV or its equivalent subject to certain restrictions that may include a lock-up period or a gate.\nDefined Contribution Savings Plan\nThe Registrants participate in a 401(k) defined contribution savings plan that is sponsored by Exelon. The plan is qualified under applicable sections of the IRC and allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. All Registrants match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. The following table presents the employer contributions and employer matching contributions to the savings plan for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n15.\nDerivative Financial Instruments (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk and interest rate risk related to ongoing business operations. The Registrants do not execute derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes.\nAuthoritative guidance requires that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value of the derivative recognized in earnings immediately. Other accounting treatments are available through special election and designation, provided they meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis. These alternative permissible accounting treatments include NPNS, cash flow hedges, and fair value hedges. At ComEd, derivative economic hedges related to commodities are recorded at fair value and offset by a corresponding regulatory asset or liability. At Exelon, derivative economic hedges related to interest rates are recorded at fair value and offsets are recorded to Electric operating revenues or Interest expense based on the activity the transaction is economically hedging. For all NPNS derivative instruments, accounts receivable or accounts payable are recorded when derivatives settle and revenue or expense is recognized in earnings as the underlying physical commodity is sold or consumed. At Exelon, derivative hedges that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value and offsets are recorded to AOCI.\n230\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments\nComEd’s use of cash collateral is generally unrestricted unless ComEd is downgraded below investment grade. Cash collateral held by PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE must be deposited in an unaffiliated major U.S. commercial bank or foreign bank with a U.S. branch office that meets certain qualifications.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe Utility Registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage their risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices by entering into physical and financial derivative contracts, which are either determined to be non-derivative or classified as economic hedges. The Utility Registrants procure electric and natural gas supply through a competitive procurement process approved by each of the respective state utility commissions. The Utility Registrants’ hedging programs are intended to reduce exposure to energy and natural gas price volatility and have no direct earnings impact as the costs are fully recovered from customers through regulatory-approved recovery mechanisms.\nThe following table provides a summary of the Utility Registrants’ primary derivative hedging instruments, listed by commodity and accounting treatment.\n_________\n(a)\nSee Note 3—Regulatory Matters for additional information.\n(b)\nThe fair value of the DPL economic hedge is not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe fair value of derivative economic hedges is presented in Other current assets and current and noncurrent Mark-to-market derivative liabilities in Exelon's and ComEd's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInterest Rate and Other Risk (Exelon)\nExelon Corporate uses a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. Exelon Corporate may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges. In addition, Exelon Corporate utilized interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure and manage potential fluctuations in Electric operating revenues at the corporate level in consolidation, which were directly correlated to yields on U.S. Treasury bonds under ComEd's distribution formula rate through December 31, 2023. These interest rate swaps were accounted for as economic hedges. A hypothetical 50 basis point change in the interest rates associated with Exelon's interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2023 would result in an immaterial impact to Exelon's Consolidated Net Income.\n231\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments\nBelow is a summary of the interest rate hedge balances at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCash Flow Hedges (Interest Rate Risk)\nFor derivative instruments that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value each period are initially recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction affects earnings. In January 2023, Exelon Corporate entered into $\n115\nmillion notional of 5-year maturity floating-to-fixed swaps and $\n115\nmillion notional of 10-year maturity floating-to-fixed swaps, for a total of $\n230\nmillion designated as cash flow hedges. In February 2023, Exelon terminated the previously issued floating-to-fixed swaps with a total notional of $\n1.5\nbillion upon issuance of $\n2.5\nbillion of debt. See Note 16 – Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information on the debt issuance. Prior to the termination, the AOCI derivative gain was $\n7\nmillion (net of tax). The settlements resulted in a cash receipt of $\n10\nmillion, which is being amortized into Interest expense in Exelon's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income over the 5-year and 10-year terms of the swaps.\nSince the termination in February 2023, Exelon has entered into additional floating-to-fixed swaps.\nThe following table provides the notional amounts outstanding held by Exelon at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe AOCI derivative loss (net of tax) was $\n10\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and gain was $\n2\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. See Note 21 – Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for additional information.\nEconomic Hedges (Interest Rate and Other Risk)\n232\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments\nExelon Corporate executes derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in interest rates but for which the fair value or cash flow hedge elections were not made. For derivatives intended to serve as economic hedges, fair value is recorded on the balance sheet and changes in fair value each period are recognized in earnings or as a regulatory asset or liability, if regulatory requirements are met, each period.\nExelon Corporate enters into floating-to-fixed interest rate cap swaps to manage a portion of interest rate exposure in connection with existing borrowings. In 2022, Exelon Corporate entered into $\n1\nbillion notional of 18-month maturity floating-to-fixed interest rate cap swaps and $\n850\nmillion notional of 6-month maturity floating-to-fixed interest rate cap swaps, for a total of $\n1,850\nmillion notional of floating-to-fixed interest rate cap swaps as of December 31, 2022. The 6-month maturity floating-to-fixed interest rate cap swaps of $\n850\nmillion notional matured in March 2023. Exelon receives payments on the interest rate cap when the floating rate exceeds the fixed rate. Settlements received are immaterial as of December 31, 2023.\nAdditionally, to manage potential fluctuations in Electric operating revenues related to ComEd's distribution formula rate, Exelon Corporate entered into a total of $\n4,875\nmillion notional of 30-year constant maturity treasury interest rate (Corporate 30-year treasury) swaps from 2022 through 2023. The Corporate 30-year treasury swaps matured on December 31, 2023 and Exelon recorded a Mark-to-market liability of $\n22\nmillion for the final settlement amount, which was paid in January 2024.\nThe following table provides the notional amounts outstanding held by Exelon at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Exelon Corporate recognized the following net pre-tax mark-to-market losses which are also recognized in Net fair value changes related to derivatives in Exelon's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nCredit Risk\nThe Registrants would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties on executed derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. The Utility Registrants have contracts to procure electric and natural gas supply that provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. If the exposure on the supply contract exceeds the amount of unsecured credit, the suppliers may be required to post collateral. The net credit exposure is mitigated primarily by the ability to recover procurement costs through customer rates. The amount of cash collateral received from external counterparties decreased as of December 31, 2023 due to decreasing energy prices.\nThe following table reflects the Registrants' cash collateral held from external counterparties, which is recorded in Other current liabilities on their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets, at December 31, 2023 and 2022\n233\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments\n__________\n(a)\nPECO had less than one million in cash collateral held with external parties as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Utility Registrants’ electric supply procurement contracts do not contain provisions that would require them to post collateral. PECO’s, BGE’s, and DPL’s natural gas procurement contracts contain provisions that could require PECO, BGE, and DPL to post collateral in the form of cash or credit support, which vary by contract and counterparty, with thresholds contingent upon PECO’s, BGE's, and DPL’s credit rating. As of December 31, 2023, PECO, BGE, and DPL were not required to post collateral for any of these agreements. If PECO, BGE, or DPL lost their investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2023, they could have been required to post collateral to their counterparties of $\n25\nmillion, $\n61\nmillion, and $\n10\nmillion, respectively.\n16.\nDebt and Credit Agreements (All Registrants)\nShort-Term Borrowings\nExelon Corporate, ComEd, and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. PECO meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. Pepco, DPL, and ACE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the PHI intercompany money pool. PHI Corporate meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of short-term notes and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. The Registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit.\nCommercial Paper\n234\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\nThe following table reflects the Registrants' commercial paper programs supported by the revolving credit agreements and bilateral credit agreements at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n__________\n(a)\nExcludes credit facility agreements arranged at minority and community banks. See below for additional information.\n(b)\nIncludes revolving credit agreements at Exelon Corporate with a maximum program size of $\n900\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Exelon Corporate had $\n527\nmillion in outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2023 and $\n449\nmillion outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2022.\n(c)\nRepresents the consolidated amounts of Pepco, DPL, and ACE.\n(d)\nThe standard maximum program size for revolving credit facilities is $\n300\nmillion each for Pepco, DPL and ACE based on the credit agreements in place. However, the facilities at Pepco, DPL, and ACE have the ability to flex to $\n500\nmillion, $\n500\nmillion, and $\n350\nmillion, respectively. The borrowing capacity may be increased or decreased during the term of the facility, except that (i) the sum of the borrowing capacity must equal the total amount of the facility, and (ii) the aggregate amount of credit used at any given time by each of Pepco, DPL, or ACE may not exceed $\n900\nmillion or the maximum amount of short-term debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities. The total number of the borrowing reallocations may not exceed eight per year during the term of the facility. In January 2024, this ability was utilized to increase ACE's program size to $\n350\nmillion. As a result, the program size for Pepco did not change and DPL was decreased to $\n250\nmillion, which prevents the aggregate amount of outstanding short-term debt from exceeding the $\n900\nmillion limit.\nIn order to maintain their respective commercial paper programs in the amounts indicated above, each Registrant must have credit facilities in place, at least equal to the amount of its commercial paper program. A registrant does not issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding the then available capacity under its credit facility.\n235\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\nAt December 31, 2023, the Registrants had the following aggregate bank commitments, credit facility borrowings, and available capacity under their respective credit facilities:\n__________\n(a)\nOn February 1, 2022, Exelon Corporate and the Utility Registrants' respective syndicated revolving credit facilities were replaced with a new\n5-year\nrevolving credit facility.\n(b)\nExcludes credit facility agreements arranged at minority and community banks. See below for additional information.\n(c)\nIncludes $\n900\nmillion aggregate bank commitment related to Exelon Corporate. Exelon Corporate had $\n3\nmillion outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2023. Exelon Corporate had $\n370\nmillion in available capacity to support additional commercial paper as of December 31, 2023.\n(d)\nRepresents the consolidated amounts of Pepco, DPL, and ACE.\nThe following table reflects the Registrants' credit facility agreements arranged at minority and community banks at December 31, 2023 and 2022. These are excluded from the Maximum Program Size and Aggregate Bank Commitment amounts within the two tables above and the facilities are solely used to issue letters of credit.\n__________\n(a)\nThese facilities were entered into on October 6, 2023 and expire on October 4, 2024.\n(b)\nRepresents the consolidated amounts of ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE.\n(c)\nRepresents the consolidated amounts of Pepco, DPL, and ACE.\nRevolving Credit Agreements\nOn February 1, 2022, Exelon Corporate and the Utility Registrants each entered into a new\n5-year\nrevolving credit facility that replaced its existing syndicated revolving credit facility. The following table reflects the credit agreements:\n236\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\nBorrowings under Exelon’s, ComEd’s, PECO’s, BGE's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's revolving credit agreements bear interest at a rate based upon either the prime rate or a SOFR-based rate, plus an adder based upon the particular Registrant’s credit rating. The adders for the prime based borrowings and SOFR-based borrowings are presented in the following table:\n__________\n(a)\nIncludes interest rate adders at Exelon Corporate of\n27.5\nbasis points and\n127.5\nbasis points for prime and SOFR-based borrowings, respectively.\nIf any registrant loses its investment grade rating, the maximum adders for prime rate borrowings and SOFR-based rate borrowings would be\n65\nbasis points and\n165\nbasis points, respectively. The credit agreements also require the borrower to pay a facility fee based upon the aggregate commitments. The fee varies depending upon the respective credit ratings of the borrower. Exelon Corporate and the Utility Registrants had\nno\noutstanding amounts on the revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2023.\nShort-Term Loan Agreements\nOn March 23, 2017, Exelon Corporate entered into a term loan agreement for $\n500\nmillion. The loan agreement was renewed in the first quarter of 2023 and was bifurcated into two tranches of $\n300\nmillion on March 14, 2023 and $\n200\nmillion on March 24, 2023. The agreements will expire on March 14, 2024 and March 22, 2024, respectively. Pursuant to the loan agreements, loans made thereunder bear interest at a variable rate equal to SOFR plus\n0.90\n% and all indebtedness thereunder is unsecured. The loan agreement is reflected in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Short-term borrowings.\nOn October 4, 2022, ComEd entered into a 364-day term loan agreement for $\n150\nmillion with a variable rate equal to SOFR plus\n0.75\n% and an expiration date of October 3, 2023. The proceeds from this loan were used to repay outstanding commercial paper obligations. The loan agreement is reflected in Exelon's and ComEd's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Short-term borrowings. The balance of the loan was repaid on January 13, 2023 in conjunction with the $\n400\nmillion and $\n575\nmillion First Mortgage Bond agreements that were entered into on January 3, 2023.\nOn May 9, 2023, ComEd entered into a 364-day term loan agreement for $\n400\nmillion with a variable rate equal to SOFR plus\n1.00\n% and an expiration date of May 7, 2024. The proceeds from this loan were used to repay outstanding commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes. The loan agreement is reflected in Exelon's and ComEd's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Short-term borrowings.\nVariable Rate Demand Bonds\nDPL has outstanding obligations in respect of Variable Rate Demand Bonds (VRDB). VRDBs are subject to repayment on the demand of the holders and, for this reason, are accounted for as short-term debt in accordance with GAAP. However, these bonds may be converted to a fixed-rate, fixed-term option to establish a maturity which corresponds to the date of final maturity of the bonds. On this basis, PHI views VRDBs as a source of long-term financing. At both December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $\n79\nmillion in variable rate demand bonds issued by DPL were outstanding and are included in the Long-term debt due within one year in Exelon's, PHI's, and DPL's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n237\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\nLong-Term Debt\nThe following tables present the outstanding long-term debt at the Registrants at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nExelon\n__________\n(a)\nSubstantially all of ComEd’s assets other than expressly excluded property and substantially all of PECO’s, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's assets are subject to the liens of their respective mortgage indentures.\n(b)\nPursuant to the loan agreement, loans made thereunder bear interest at a variable rate equal to SOFR plus\n0.85\n%.\n(c)\nAmounts owed to these financing trusts are recorded as Long-term debt to financing trusts within Exelon’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n238\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\nComEd\n__________\n(a)\nSubstantially all of ComEd’s assets, other than expressly excluded property, are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture.\n(b)\nAmount owed to this financing trust is recorded as Long-term debt to financing trust within ComEd’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPECO\n__________\n(a)\nSubstantially all of PECO’s assets are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture.\n(b)\nAmounts owed to this financing trust are recorded as Long-term debt to financing trusts within PECO’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n239\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\nBGE\n240\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\nPHI\n_________\n(a)\nSubstantially all of Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's assets are subject to the liens of their respective mortgage indentures.\nPepco\n________\n(a)\nSubstantially all of Pepco's assets are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture.\nDPL\n__________\n(a)\nSubstantially all of DPL's assets are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture.\n(b)\nThe amount in the Unamortized debt discount and premium, net category was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n241\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\nACE\n__________\n(a)\nSubstantially all of ACE's assets are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture.\nLong-term debt maturities at the Registrants in the periods 2024 through 2028 and thereafter are as follows:\n__________\n(a)\nIncludes $\n390\nmillion due to ComEd and PECO financing trusts.\n(b)\nIncludes $\n206\nmillion due to ComEd financing trust.\n(c)\nIncludes $\n184\nmillion due to PECO financing trusts.\nLong-Term Debt to Affiliates\nIn connection with the debt obligations assumed by Exelon as part of the Constellation merger, Exelon and subsidiaries of Generation (former Constellation subsidiaries) entered into intercompany loan agreements that mirror the terms and amounts of the third-party debt obligations of Exelon, resulting in intercompany notes receivable at Exelon Corporate from Generation. In connection with the separation, on January 31, 2022, Exelon Corporate received cash from Generation of $\n258\nmillion to settle the intercompany loan.\nDebt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Registrants are in compliance with debt covenants.\n17.\nFair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities (All Registrants)\nExelon measures and classifies fair value measurements in accordance with the hierarchy as defined by GAAP. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to liquidate as of the reporting date.\n•\nLevel 2 — inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.\n242\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\n•\nLevel 3 — unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models or third-party valuations for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability.\nFair Value of Financial Liabilities Recorded at Amortized Cost\nThe following tables present the carrying amounts and fair values of the Registrants’ short-term liabilities, long-term debt, and trust preferred securities (long-term debt to financing trusts or junior subordinated debentures) at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Registrants have\nno\nfinancial liabilities classified as Level 1 or measured using the NAV practical expedient.\nThe carrying amounts of the Registrants’ short-term liabilities as presented in their Consolidated Balance Sheets are representative of their fair value (Level 2) because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\n__________\n(a)\nIncludes unamortized debt issuance costs, unamortized debt discount and premium, net, purchase accounting fair value adjustments, and finance lease liabilities which are not fair valued. Refer to Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements for unamortized debt issuance costs, unamortized debt discount and premium, net, and purchase accounting fair value adjustments and Note 10 — Leases for finance lease liabilities.\n243\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nExelon uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value of financial liabilities recorded at carrying cost:\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables present assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value in the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Exelon and the Utility Registrants have immaterial and\nno\nfinancial assets or liabilities measured using the NAV practical expedient, respectively:\n244\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nExelon\n__________\n(a)\nExcludes cash of $\n334\nmillion and $\n345\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and restricted cash of $\n149\nmillion and $\n81\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and includes long-term restricted cash of $\n174\nmillion and $\n117\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is reported in Other deferred debits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nComEd, PECO, and BGE\n245\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\n__________\n(a)\nComEd excludes cash of $\n86\nmillion and $\n42\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and restricted cash of $\n147\nmillion and $\n77\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and includes long-term restricted cash of $\n174\nmillion and $\n117\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is reported in Other deferred debits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. PECO excludes cash of $\n42\nmillion and $\n58\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. BGE excludes cash of $\n47\nmillion and $\n43\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and restricted cash of $\n1\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(b)\nThe Level 3 balance consists of the current and noncurrent liability of $\n27\nmillion and $\n106\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2023, and $\n5\nmillion and $\n79\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2022 related to floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers.\nPHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE\n246\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\n__________\n(a)\nPHI excludes cash of $\n96\nmillion and $\n165\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and restricted cash of $\n1\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Pepco excludes cash of $\n48\nmillion and $\n45\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and restricted cash of $\n1\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. DPL excludes cash of $\n15\nmillion and $\n31\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. ACE excludes cash of $\n21\nmillion and $\n71\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nReconciliation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the fair value reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n247\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\n__________\n(a)\nClassified in Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(b)\nIncludes $\n83\nmillion of decreases in fair value and an increase for realized gains due to settlements of $\n34\nmillion recorded in Purchased power expense associated with floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the year ended December 31, 2023. Includes $\n136\nmillion of increases in fair value and a decrease for realized losses due to settlements of $\n1\nmillion recorded in Purchased power expense associated with floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(c)\nThe balance of the current and noncurrent asset was effectively\nzero\nas of December 31, 2023. The balance consists of a current and noncurrent liability of $\n27\nmillion and $\n106\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\nValuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value\nCash Equivalents (All Registrants).\nInvestments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased, including mutual and money market funds, are considered cash equivalents. The fair values are based on observable market prices and, therefore, are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.\nRabbi Trust Investments (Exelon, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE).\nThe Rabbi trusts were established to hold assets related to deferred compensation plans existing for certain active and retired members of Exelon’s executive management and directors. The Rabbi trusts' assets are included in Investments in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist primarily of money market funds, mutual funds, fixed income securities, and life insurance policies. Money market funds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and have been categorized as Level 1 given the clear observability of the prices. The fair values of fixed income securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2. The life insurance policies are valued using the cash surrender value of the policies, net of loans against those policies, which is provided by a third-party. Certain life insurance policies, which consist primarily of mutual funds that are priced based on observable market data, have been categorized as Level 2 because the life insurance policies can be liquidated at the reporting date for the value of the underlying assets. Life insurance policies that are valued using unobservable inputs have been categorized as Level 3, where the fair value is determined based on the cash surrender value of the policy, which contains unobservable inputs and assumptions. Because Exelon  relies on its third-party insurance provider to develop the inputs without adjustment for the valuations of its Level 3 investments, quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in valuing these investments is not reasonably available to Exelon. Therefore, Exelon has not disclosed such inputs.\nInterest Rate Derivatives (Exelon)\nExelon may utilize fixed-to-floating or floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps as a means to manage interest rate risk. These interest rate swaps are typically accounted for as economic hedges. In addition, Exelon may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in interest rate levels in anticipation of future financings. These interest rate derivatives are typically designated as cash flow hedges. Exelon determines the current fair value by calculating the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement, based on and discounted by the market's expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk and other market parameters. As these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments\nfor additional information on mark-to-market derivatives.\n248\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nDeferred Compensation Obligations (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants’ deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into a notional investment account. The Registrants include such plans in other current and noncurrent liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Registrants’ deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants’ notional investment accounts. The underlying notional investments are comprised primarily of equities, mutual funds, commingled funds, and fixed income securities which are based on directly and indirectly observable market prices. Since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe value of certain employment agreement obligations (which are included with the Deferred Compensation Obligation in the tables above) are based on a known and certain stream of payments to be made over time and are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nCommodity Derivatives (Exelon and ComEd).\nOn December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year floating to fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. Delivery under the contracts began in June 2012. The fair value of these swaps has been designated as a Level 3 valuation due to the long tenure of the positions and the internal modeling assumptions. The modeling assumptions include using forward power prices. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information on mark-to-market derivatives.\nThe following table discloses the significant unobservable inputs to the forward curve used to value mark-to-market derivatives:\n__________\n(a)\nAn increase to the forward power price would increase the fair value.\n18.\nCommitments and Contingencies (All Registrants)\nCommitments\nPHI Merger Commitments (Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE).\nApproval of the PHI Merger in Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and the District of Columbia was conditioned upon Exelon and PHI agreeing to certain commitments.\nThe following amounts represent total commitment costs that have been recorded since the acquisition date and the total remaining obligations for Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE at December 31, 2023:\n__________\n(a)\nRemaining commitments extend through 2026 and include escrow funds, charitable contributions, and rate credits.\n249\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\nCommercial Commitments (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants' commercial commitments at December 31, 2023, representing commitments potentially triggered by future events were as follows:\n250\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\n__________\n(a)\nExelon and certain of its subsidiaries maintain non-debt letters of credit to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties.\n(b)\nSurety bonds—Guarantees issued related to contract and commercial agreements, excluding bid bonds. Historically, payments under the guarantees have not been made and the likelihood of payments being required is remote.\n(c)\nReflects guarantee of ComEd and PECO securities held by ComEd Financing III, PECO Trust III, and PECO Trust IV.\n(d)\nRepresents the maximum potential obligation in the event that the fair value of certain leased equipment and fleet vehicles is zero at the end of the maximum lease term. The lease term associated with these assets ranges from\n1\nto\n8\nyears. The maximum potential obligation at the end of the minimum lease term would be $\n61\nmillion guaranteed by Exelon and PHI, of which $\n20\nmillion\n,\n$\n24\nmillion, and $\n17\nmillion is guaranteed by Pepco, DPL, and ACE, respectively. Historically, payments under the guarantees have not been made and PHI believes the likelihood of payments being required under the guarantees is remote.\nEnvironmental Remediation Matters\nGeneral (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants’ operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under federal and state environmental laws, the Registrants are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. Unless otherwise disclosed, the Registrants cannot reasonably estimate whether they will incur significant liabilities for additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by the Registrants, environmental agencies or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable from third parties, including customers. Additional costs could have a material, unfavorable impact on the Registrants' financial statements.\nMGP Sites (All Registrants).\nComEd, PECO, BGE, and DPL have identified sites where former MGP or gas purification activities have or may have resulted in actual site contamination. For some sites, there are additional PRPs that may share responsibility for the ultimate remediation of each location.\n•\nComEd has\n17\nsites that are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. ComEd expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2031.\n•\nPECO has\n6\nsites that are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. PECO expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2025.\n•\nBGE has\n4\nsites that currently require some level of remediation and/or ongoing activity. BGE expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2025.\n•\nDPL has\n1\nsite that is currently under study and the required cost at the site is not expected to be material.\nThe historical nature of the MGP and gas purification sites and the fact that many of the sites have been buried and built over, impacts the ability to determine a precise estimate of the ultimate costs prior to initial sampling and determination of the exact scope and method of remedial activity. Management determines its best estimate of remediation costs using all available information at the time of each study, including probabilistic and deterministic modeling for ComEd and PECO, and the remediation standards currently required by the applicable state environmental agency. Prior to completion of any significant clean up, each site remediation plan is approved by the appropriate state environmental agency.\nComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to a PAPUC order, are currently recovering environmental remediation costs of former MGP facility sites through customer rates. While BGE and DPL do not have riders for MGP clean-up costs, they have historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs in distribution rates.\nIn 2023, ComEd and PECO completed an annual study of their future estimated MGP remediation requirements. The study resulted in a $\n25\nmillion increase to the environmental liability and related regulatory asset for ComEd.\n251\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\nThe increase was primarily due to increased costs resulting from inflation and changes in remediation plans. The study did not result in a material change to the environmental liability for PECO.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Registrants had accrued the following undiscounted amounts for environmental liabilities in Accrued expenses, Other current liabilities, and Other deferred credits and other liabilities in their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nBenning Road Site (Exelon, PHI, and Pepco).\nIn September 2010, PHI received a letter from EPA identifying the Benning Road site as one of six land-based sites potentially contributing to contamination of the lower Anacostia River. A portion of the site, which is owned by Pepco, was formerly the location of an electric generating facility owned by Pepco subsidiary, Pepco Energy Services (PES), which became a part of Generation, following the 2016 merger between PHI and Exelon. This  generating facility was deactivated in June 2012. The remaining portion of the site consists of a Pepco transmission and distribution service center that remains in operation. In December 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia approved a Consent Decree entered into by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services (hereinafter \"Pepco Entities\") with the DOEE, which requires the Pepco Entities to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the Benning Road site and an approximately 10 to 15-acre portion of the adjacent Anacostia River. The purpose of this RI/FS is to define the nature and extent of contamination from the Benning Road site and to evaluate remedial alternatives.\nPursuant to an internal agreement between the Pepco Entities, since 2013, Pepco has performed the work required by the Consent Decree and has been reimbursed for that work by an agreed upon allocation of costs between the Pepco Entities. In September 2019, the Pepco Entities issued a draft “final” RI report which DOEE approved on February 3, 2020. The Pepco Entities are completing a FS to evaluate possible remedial alternatives for submission to DOEE. In October, 2022, DOEE approved dividing the work to complete the landside portion of the FS from the waterside portion to expedite the overall schedule for completion of the project. It is currently anticipated that the landside FS will be complete and approved by DOEE by the end of the first quarter of 2024 and the waterside FS will be complete and approved by DOEE by the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.  Following the completion of each FS, DOEE will issue a Proposed Plan for public comment and then issue a Record of Decision (ROD) identifying the remedial actions determined to be necessary for the area in question. On October 3, 2023, DOEE and Pepco entered into an addendum to the Benning Consent Decree pursuant to which Pepco has agreed to fund or perform the remedial actions to be selected by DOEE for the landslide and water areas. This addendum to the Benning Consent Decree has been lodged with the court in January 2024.  Once the addendum is signed and entered by the court it will become effective.\nAs part of the separation between Exelon and Constellation in February 2022, the internal agreement between the Pepco Entities for completion and payment for the remaining Consent Decree work was memorialized in a formal agreement for post-separation activities. A second post-separation assumption agreement between Exelon and Constellation transferred any of the potential remaining remediation liability, if any, of PES/Generation to a non-utility subsidiary of Exelon which going forward will be responsible for those liabilities. Exelon, PHI, and Pepco have determined that a loss associated with this matter is probable and have accrued an estimated liability, which is included in the table above.\nAnacostia River Tidal Reach (Exelon, PHI, and Pepco).\nContemporaneous with the Benning Road site RI/FS being performed by the Pepco Entities, DOEE and NPS have been conducting a separate RI/FS focused on the\n252\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\nentire tidal reach of the Anacostia River extending from just north of the Maryland-District of Columbia boundary line to the confluence of the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. The river-wide RI incorporated the results of the river sampling performed by the Pepco Entities as part of the Benning RI/FS, as well as similar sampling efforts conducted by owners of other sites adjacent to this segment of the river and supplemental river sampling conducted by DOEE’s contractor.\nOn September 30, 2020, DOEE released its Interim ROD for the Anacostia River sediments. The Interim ROD reflects an adaptive management approach which will require several identified “hot spots” in the river to be addressed first while continuing to conduct studies and to monitor the river to evaluate improvements and determine potential future remediation plans. The adaptive management process chosen by DOEE is less intrusive, provides more long-term environmental certainty, is less costly, and allows for site specific remediation plans already underway, including the plan for the Benning Road site to proceed to conclusion.\nOn July 15, 2022, Pepco received a letter from the District of Columbia's Office of the Attorney General (D.C. OAG) on behalf of DOEE conveying a settlement offer to resolve all PRPs' liability to the District of Columbia (District) for their past costs and their anticipated future costs to complete the work for the Interim ROD. Pepco responded on July 27, 2022 to enter into settlement discussions. On October 3, 2023, Pepco and the District entered into another consent decree (the “Anacostia River Consent Decree”) pursuant to which Pepco agreed to pay $\n47\nmillion to resolve its liability to the District for all past costs to perform the river-wide RI/FS and all future costs to complete the work required by the Interim ROD. This amount will be paid in four equal annual installments beginning a year after the effective date of the Anacostia River Consent Decree. The funds will be deposited into the DOEE’s Clean Land Fund for the District’s costs of the Interim ROD work.  The Anacostia River Consent Decree caps Pepco’s liability for these costs and provides Pepco with the right to seek contribution from other potentially responsible parties.  The Anacostia River Consent Decree was lodged with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in January 2024. Once the court signs and approves the Anacostia River Consent Decree it will become effective. Exelon, PHI, and Pepco have accrued a liability for Pepco’s payment obligations under the Anacostia Consent Decree and management's best estimate of its share of any other future Anacostia River response costs. Pepco has concluded that incremental exposure remains reasonably possible, but management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss beyond the amounts recorded, which are included in the table above.\nIn addition to the activities associated with the remedial process outlined above, CERCLA separately requires federal and state (here including Washington, D.C.) Natural Resource Trustees (federal or state agencies designated by the President or the relevant state, respectively, or Indian tribes) to conduct an assessment of any damages to natural resources within their jurisdiction as a result of the contamination that is being remediated. The Trustees can seek compensation from responsible parties for such damages, including restoration costs. During the second quarter of 2018, Pepco became aware that the Trustees are in the beginning stages of a NRD assessment, a process that often takes many years beyond the remedial decision to complete. Pepco has concluded that a loss associated with the eventual NRD assessment is reasonably possible. Due to the very early stage of the NRD process, Pepco cannot reasonably estimate the final range of loss potentially resulting from this process.\nAs noted in the Benning Road Site disclosure above, as part of the separation of Exelon and Constellation in February 2022, an assumption agreement was executed transferring any potential future remediation liabilities associated with the Benning Site remediation to a non-utility subsidiary of Exelon. Similarly, any potential future liability associated with the Anacostia River Sediment Project (ARSP) was also assumed by this entity.\nBuzzard Point Site (Exelon, PHI, and Pepco).\nOn December 8, 2022, Pepco received a letter from the D.C. OAG, alleging wholly past violations of the District's stormwater discharge and waste disposal requirements related to operations at the Buzzard Point facility, a 9-acre parcel of waterfront property in Washington, D.C. occupied by an active substation and former steam plant building. The letter also alleged wholly past violations by Pepco of stormwater discharge requirements related to its district-wide system of underground vaults. On October 3, 2023, Pepco entered into a Consent Order with the District of Columbia to resolve the alleged violations without any admission of liability. The Consent Order requires Pepco to pay a civil penalty of $\n10\nmillion. In addition, Pepco has agreed to assess the environmental conditions at its Buzzard Point facility and conduct any remedial actions deemed necessary as a result of the assessment, and also to assess potential environmental impacts associated with the operation of its underground vaults. The Consent Order was lodged with the District of Columbia Superior Court in January 2024. The court signed and entered the Consent Order, and it became effective on February 2, 2024. Exelon, PHI, and Pepco have accrued a liability for the penalty\n253\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\npayments and for the projected costs for the required environmental assessments and remediation. Pepco has concluded that incremental exposure is reasonably possible, but the range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated beyond the amounts included in the table above.\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters\nFund Transfer Restrictions (All Registrants).\nUnder applicable law, Exelon may borrow or receive an extension of credit from its subsidiaries. Under the terms of Exelon’s intercompany money pool agreement, Exelon can lend to, but not borrow from the money pool.\nUnder applicable law, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, or ACE may limit the dividends that these Registrants can distribute to Exelon.\nComEd has agreed in connection with financings arranged through ComEd Financing III that it will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued. No such event has occurred.\nPECO has agreed in connection with financings arranged through PEC L.P. and PECO Trust IV that PECO will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debentures, which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are issued.

No such events have occurred.\nDPA and Related Matters (Exelon and ComEd).\nExelon and ComEd received a grand jury subpoena in the second quarter of 2019 from the USAO requiring production of information concerning their lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. On October 4, 2019, Exelon and ComEd received a second grand jury subpoena from the USAO requiring production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities. On October 22, 2019, the SEC notified Exelon and ComEd that it had also opened an investigation into their lobbying activities. On July 17, 2020, ComEd entered into a DPA with the USAO to resolve the USAO investigation. Under the DPA, the USAO filed a single charge alleging that ComEd improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor\n254\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\nsubcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the former Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Speaker’s associates, with the intent to influence the Speaker’s action regarding legislation affecting ComEd’s interests. The DPA provided that the USAO would defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against ComEd in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period subject to certain obligations of ComEd, including payment to the U.S. Treasury of $\n200\nmillion, which was paid in November 2020. Exelon was not made a party to the DPA, and therefore the investigation by the USAO into Exelon’s activities ended with no charges being brought against Exelon. The three-year term of the DPA ended on July 17, 2023, and on that same date the court granted the USAO’s motion to dismiss the pending charge against ComEd that had been deferred by the DPA.\nOn September 28, 2023, Exelon and ComEd reached a settlement with the SEC, concluding and resolving in its entirety the SEC investigation, which related to the conduct identified in the DPA that was entered into by ComEd in July 2020 and successfully exited in July 2023. Under the terms of the settlement, Exelon agreed to pay a civil penalty of $\n46.2\nmillion and Exelon and ComEd agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of specified provisions of the federal securities laws and rules promulgated thereunder. Exelon recorded an accrual for the full amount of the penalty in the second quarter of 2023, which was reflected in Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and in Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Exelon paid the civil penalty in full on October 4, 2023.\nSubsequent to Exelon announcing the receipt of the subpoenas, various lawsuits were filed, and various demand letters were received related to the subject of the subpoenas and, the conduct described in the DPA and the SEC's investigation, including:\n•\nFour putative class action lawsuits against ComEd and Exelon were filed in federal court on behalf of ComEd customers in the third quarter of 2020 alleging, among other things, civil violations of federal racketeering laws. In addition, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) filed a motion to intervene in these cases on October 22, 2020 which was granted on December 23, 2020. On September 9, 2021, the federal court granted Exelon’s and ComEd’s motion to dismiss and dismissed the plaintiffs’ and CUB’s federal law claim with prejudice. The federal court also dismissed the related state law claims made by the federal plaintiffs and CUB on jurisdictional grounds. Plaintiffs appealed dismissal of the federal law claim to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Plaintiffs and CUB also refiled their state law claims in state court and moved to consolidate them with the already pending consumer state court class action, discussed below. On August 22, 2022, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the consolidated federal cases in their entirety. The time to further appeal has passed and the Seventh Circuit’s decision is final.\n•\nThree putative class action lawsuits against ComEd and Exelon were filed in Illinois state court in the third quarter of 2020 seeking restitution and compensatory damages on behalf of ComEd customers. The cases were consolidated into a single action in October of 2020. In November 2020, CUB filed a motion to intervene in the cases pursuant to an Illinois statute allowing CUB to intervene as a party or otherwise participate on behalf of utility consumers in any proceeding which affects the interest of utility consumers. On November 23, 2020, the court allowed CUB’s intervention, but denied CUB's request to stay these cases. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a consolidated complaint, and ComEd and Exelon filed a motion to dismiss on jurisdictional and substantive grounds on January 11, 2021. Briefing on that motion was completed on March 2, 2021. The parties agreed, on March 25, 2021, along with the federal court plaintiffs discussed above, to jointly engage in mediation. The parties participated in a one-day mediation on June 7, 2021 but no settlement was reached. On December 23, 2021, the state court granted ComEd and Exelon’s motion to dismiss with prejudice. On December 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider that dismissal and for permission to amend their complaint. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion on January 21, 2022. Plaintiffs have appealed the court's ruling dismissing their complaint to the First District Court of Appeals. On February 15, 2022, Exelon and ComEd moved to dismiss the federal plaintiffs' refiled state law claims, seeking dismissal on the same legal grounds asserted in their motion to dismiss the original state court plaintiffs' complaint. The court granted dismissal of the refiled state claims on February 16, 2022. The original federal plaintiffs appealed that dismissal on February 18, 2022. The two state appeals were consolidated on March 21, 2022. On September 8, 2023, the Illinois appellate court affirmed the dismissal. Plaintiffs have asked the Illinois Supreme Court to grant them leave to further appeal, but such appeal is not allowed as a matter of right.\n255\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\nExelon and ComEd filed a response in opposition to the request for leave to further appeal on January 12, 2024.\n•\nOn November 3, 2022, a plaintiff filed a putative class action complaint in Lake County, Illinois Circuit Court against ComEd and Exelon for unjust enrichment and deceptive business practices in connection with the conduct giving rise to the DPA. Plaintiff seeks an accounting and disgorgement of any benefits ComEd allegedly obtained from said conduct. Plaintiff served initial discovery requests on ComEd in December 2022, to which ComEd has responded. ComEd and Exelon filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint on February 3, 2023. On June 16, 2023, the court granted Exelon and ComEd's motion to dismiss the action with prejudice. Plaintiff filed its notice of appeal of that dismissal on July 17, 2023. Plaintiff's opening appellate brief was filed on October 19, 2023. ComEd and Exelon filed a response on January 2, 2024. Plaintiff filed its reply brief on February 2, 2024. With leave of court, Exelon and ComEd filed a sur-reply on February 14, 2024. The appellate court has set oral argument for April 3, 2024.\n•\nA putative class action lawsuit against Exelon and certain officers of Exelon and ComEd was filed in federal court in December 2019 alleging misrepresentations and omissions in Exelon’s SEC filings related to ComEd’s lobbying activities and the related investigations. The complaint was amended on September 16, 2020, to dismiss two of the original defendants and add other defendants, including ComEd. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in November 2020. The court denied the motion in April 2021. On May 26, 2021, defendants moved the court to certify its order denying the motion to dismiss for interlocutory appeal. Briefing on the motion was completed in June 2021, and that motion was denied on January 28, 2022. In May 2021, the parties each filed respective initial discovery disclosures. On June 9, 2021, defendants filed their answer and affirmative defenses to the complaint and the parties engaged thereafter in discovery. On September 9, 2021, the U.S. government moved to intervene in the lawsuit and stay discovery until the parties entered into an amendment to their protective order that would prohibit the parties from requesting discovery into certain matters, including communications with the U.S. government. The court ordered said amendment to the protective order on November 15, 2021 and discovery resumed. The court further amended the protective order on October 17, 2022 and extended it until May 15, 2023. Following mediation, the parties reached a settlement of the lawsuit, under which defendants agreed to pay plaintiffs $\n173\nmillion. On May 26, 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement, which the court granted on June 9, 2023. The court granted final settlement approval on September 7, 2023. The settlement was fully covered by insurance and has been paid in full.\n•\nSeveral shareholders have sent letters to the Exelon Board of Directors since 2020 demanding, among other things, that the Exelon Board of Directors investigate and address alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and other alleged violations by Exelon and ComEd officers and directors related to the conduct described in the DPA. In the first quarter of 2021, the Exelon Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee (SLC) consisting of disinterested and independent parties to investigate and address these shareholders' allegations and make recommendations to the Exelon Board of Directors based on the outcome of the SLC's investigation. In July 2021, one of the demand letter shareholders filed a derivative action against current and former Exelon and ComEd officers and directors, and against Exelon, as nominal defendant, asserting the same claims made in its demand letter. On October 12, 2021, the parties to the derivative action filed an agreed motion to stay that litigation for 120 days in order to allow the SLC to continue its investigation, which the court granted. The stay has been extended several times. The parties participated in a mediation in February 2023, but the matter did not resolve at that time. On April 26 and May 1, 2023, two additional demand letter shareholders each filed a separate derivative lawsuit against current and former Exelon and ComEd officers and directors, and certain third parties, and against Exelon as nominal defendant, asserting claims similar to those made in their respective demand letters. On May 25, 2023, certain demand letter shareholders (Settling Shareholders) filed a separate derivative lawsuit against current and former Exelon and ComEd officers and directors, and against Exelon as nominal defendant, asserting claims similar to those made in their respective demand letters. The then pending derivative lawsuits were subsequently consolidated. On May 26, 2023, prior to lawsuit consolidation, the SLC filed a Notice of Determination and Intent to Seek Court Approval of Settlement (Notice of Determination). The Notice of Determination stated that, through mediation efforts, a settlement of the derivative claims had been approved by the SLC, the Independent Review Committee of the Board (which had been formed in the third quarter of 2022, to ensure the Board’s consideration of any SLC recommendations would be independent and objective),\n256\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\nthe Board, and the Settling Shareholders (the Settling Parties). The Notice of Determination further specified the process by which the Settling Parties would seek court approval of the proposed settlement and resolution and dismissal of all derivative claims and lawsuits, including any lawsuits or actions brought by demand letter shareholders who are not participating in the proposed settlement. In furtherance of the proposed settlement, on June 16, 2023, the SLC filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement, attaching the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (Stipulation), which contains the terms of the proposed settlement. The proposed settlement terms include but are not limited to: a payment of $\n40\nmillion to Exelon by Exelon’s insurers of which $\n10\nmillion constitutes the attorneys’ fee award to be paid to the Settling Shareholders’ counsel; various compliance and disclosure-related reforms; and certain changes in Board and Committee composition. On June 13, 2023, the non-settling derivative shareholders filed a motion asking the court to set a status conference to discuss lifting the discovery stay. On June 29, 2023, an additional shareholder filed a separate derivative lawsuit against current and former Exelon and ComEd officers and directors, and against Exelon as nominal defendant, asserting claims similar to those made in its demand letter. That lawsuit has been consolidated into the other pending derivative lawsuits. On June 30, 2023, the non-settling shareholders’ motion for status and the SLC’s motion for preliminary approval was heard by the court, during which the court set a briefing schedule on the appropriate standard for evaluating the settlement and the proper scope of requested discovery. Following briefing and a hearing, the court allowed the non-settling shareholders to seek certain, limited discovery, which the SLC, Independent Review Committee, and Exelon responded to on October 5, 2023. On October 11, 2023, an additional non-settling shareholder filed a separate derivative lawsuit against current and former Exelon and ComEd officers and directors, and against Exelon as a nominal defendant, asserting claims similar to those made in its demand letter. That lawsuit has been consolidated into the other pending derivative lawsuits. The SLC filed its renewed motion for preliminary approval on October 26, 2023, with supporting submissions filed by the Independent Review Committee, Exelon, and the settling shareholders on that same day. The non-settling plaintiffs filed a response to the renewed motion for preliminary approval and supporting submissions on November 29, 2023, and the SLC Independent Review Committee, Exelon and the Settling Shareholders filed their respective reply briefs on December 21, 2023. On January 16, 2024, the non-settling plaintiffs sought leave of court to file a sur-reply, which the court granted on January 18, 2024.\nIn August 2022, the ICC concluded its investigation initiated on August 12, 2021 into rate impacts of conduct admitted in the DPA, including the costs recovered from customers related to the DPA and Exelon's funding of the fine paid by ComEd. On August 17, 2022, the ICC issued its final order accepting ComEd's voluntary customer refund offer of approximately $\n38\nmillion (of which about $\n31\nmillion is ICC jurisdictional; the remaining balance is FERC jurisdictional) that resolves the question of whether customer funds were used for DPA related activities. The customer refund includes the cost of every individual or entity that was either (i) identified in the DPA or (ii) identified by ComEd as an associate of the former Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives in the ICC proceeding. The ICC’s DPA investigation is now closed. The ICC jurisdictional refund was made to customers during the April 2023 billing cycle, as required by the ICC. The FERC jurisdictional refund was included in ComEd's transmission formula rate update proceeding, filed on May 12, 2023. The filed transmission rate, inclusive of the FERC jurisdictional DPA refund, will appear on ComEd retail customers' bills for the June 2023 through May 2024 monthly billing periods, in the line designated as \"Transmission Services Charge.\" The customer refund will not be recovered in rates or charged to customers and ComEd will not seek or accept reimbursement or indemnification from any source other than Exelon. An accrual for the amount of the customer refund has been recorded in Regulatory assets in Exelon’s and ComEd’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023.\nSavings Plan Claim (Exelon).\nOn December 6, 2021, seven current and former employees filed a putative ERISA class action suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Exelon, its Board of Directors, the former Board Investment Oversight Committee, the Corporate Investment Committee, individual defendants, and other unnamed fiduciaries of the Exelon Corporation Employee Savings Plan (Plan). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties under the Plan by including certain investment options that allegedly were more expensive than and underperformed similar passively-managed or other funds available in the marketplace and permitting a third-party administrative service provider/recordkeeper and an investment adviser to charge excessive fees for the services provided. The plaintiffs seek declaratory, equitable and monetary relief on behalf of the Plan and participants. On February 16, 2022, the court granted the parties' stipulated dismissal of the individual named defendants without prejudice. The remaining defendants filed\n257\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\na motion to dismiss the complaint on February 25, 2022. On March 4, 2022, the Chamber of Commerce filed a brief of amicus curiae in support of the defendants' motion to dismiss. On September 22, 2022, the court granted Exelon’s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The court granted plaintiffs leave until October 31, 2022 to file an amended complaint, which was later extended to November 30, 2022. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on November 30, 2022. Defendants filed their motion to dismiss the amended complaint on January 20, 2023. On September 29, 2023, the court again granted Exelon's motion to dismiss but granted plaintiffs leave until October 20, 2023 to file a second amended complaint. Plaintiffs did not file an amended complaint by the deadline. On October 25, 2023, the parties filed a joint Stipulation of Dismissal, which provides that plaintiffs agreed that they will not initiate an appeal from the dismissal of this matter, and the parties agree that each side shall bear their own costs and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs also acknowledge in the Stipulation that defendants have neither paid nor agreed to pay or provide any monetary or equitable remedy in connection with the dismissal of this action. On October 27, 2023, the court entered final judgment dismissing the matter with prejudice. No loss contingencies have been reflected in Exelon’s consolidated financial statements with respect to this matter.\nGeneral (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are involved in various other litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. The Registrants are also from time to time subject to audits and investigations by the FERC and other regulators. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. The Registrants maintain accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss, particularly where (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.\n19.\nShareholders' Equity (All Registrants)\nEquity Securities Offering (Exelon)\nOn August 4, 2022, Exelon entered into an agreement with certain underwriters in connection with an underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of\n11.3\nmillion shares (the “Shares”) of its Common stock,\nno\npar value (“Common Stock”). The Shares were sold to the underwriters at a price per share of $\n43.32\n. Exelon also granted the underwriters an option to purchase an additional\n1.695\nmillion shares of Common stock also at the price per share of $\n43.32\n. On August 5, 2022, the underwriters exercised the option in full. The net proceeds from the Offering and the exercise of the underwriters’ option were $\n563\nmillion before expenses paid by Exelon. Exelon used the proceeds, together with available cash balances, to repay $\n575\nmillion in borrowings under a $\n1.15\nbillion term loan credit facility. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information on Exelon’s term loan.\nAt-the-Market Program (Exelon)\nOn August 4, 2022, Exelon executed an equity distribution agreement (“Equity Distribution Agreement”), with certain sales agents and forward sellers and certain forward purchasers, establishing an ATM equity distribution program under which it may offer and sell shares of its Common stock, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $\n1.0\nbillion. Exelon has no obligation to offer or sell any shares of Common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may, at any time, suspend or terminate offers and sales under the Equity Distribution Agreement. In November and December 2023, Exelon issued approximately\n3.6\nmillion shares of Common stock at an average gross price of $\n39.58\nper share. The net proceeds from these issuances were $\n140\nmillion, which were used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2023, $\n858\nmillion of Common stock remained available for sale pursuant to the ATM program.\nComEd Common Stock Warrants\n258\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 — Shareholders' Equity\nThe following table presents warrants outstanding to purchase ComEd common stock and shares of common stock reserved for the conversion of warrants. The warrants entitle the holders to convert such warrants into common stock of ComEd at a conversion rate of one share of common stock for three warrants.\nShare Repurchases\nThere currently is\nno\nExelon Board of Director authority to repurchase shares. Any previous shares repurchased are held as treasury shares, at cost, unless cancelled or reissued at the discretion of Exelon’s management.\nPreferred and Preference Securities\nThe following table presents Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, and ACE's shares of preferred securities authorized,\nnone\nof which were outstanding, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

At December 31, 2023, there were approximately\n33\nmillion shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, exercised and distributed stock-based awards were primarily issued from authorized but unissued Common stock shares.\nSeparation-related Adjustments.\nIn connection with the separation, Exelon and Constellation entered into an Employee Matters Agreement, effective February 1, 2022. Under the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement, and pursuant to the terms of the LTIP, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Exelon approved an\n259\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 20 — Stock-Based Compensation Plans\nadjustment to outstanding awards granted under the LTIP in order to preserve the intrinsic aggregate value of such awards before the separation. The separation-related adjustments did not have a material impact on either compensation expense or the potentially dilutive securities to be considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of Common stock. Former Exelon employees transferred to Constellation as a result of the separation surrendered their outstanding unvested Exelon awards effective February 1, 2022.\nThe Registrants grant cash awards. The following table does not include expense related to these plans as they are not considered stock-based compensation plans under the applicable authoritative guidance.\nThe following table presents the stock-based compensation expense included in Exelon's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The Utility Registrants' stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was not material.\nExelon receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award on the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for performance share awards and restricted stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, Exelon recognizes the tax benefit related to compensation costs.\nThe following table presents information regarding Exelon’s realized tax benefit when distributed:\nPerformance Share Awards\nPerformance share awards are granted under the LTIP. The performance share awards are settled\n50\n% in common stock and\n50\n% in cash at the end of the\nthree-year\nperformance period, except for awards that are settled\n100\n% in cash if certain ownership requirements are satisfied.\nThe common stock portion of the performance share awards is considered an equity award and is valued based on Exelon's stock price on the grant date. The cash portion of the performance share awards is considered a liability award which is remeasured each reporting period based on Exelon’s current stock price. As the value of the common stock and cash portions of the awards are based on Exelon’s stock price during the performance period, coupled with changes in the total shareholder return modifier and expected payout of the award, the compensation costs are subject to volatility until payout is established.\nFor nonretirement-eligible employees, stock-based compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period of\nthree years\nusing the straight-line method. For performance share awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, the value of the performance shares is recognized ratably over the vesting period, which is the year of grant. Exelon processes forfeitures as they occur for employees who do not complete the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes Exelon’s nonvested performance share awards activity:\n260\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 20 — Stock-Based Compensation Plans\n__________\n(a)\nExcludes\n1,198,093\nand\n1,539,819\nof performance share awards issued to retirement-eligible employees as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as they are fully vested.\n(b)\nRepresents performance share awards that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2023\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average grant date fair value and the total fair value of performance share awards vested.\n__________\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2023, $\n11\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance shares are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of\n1.8\nyears.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units are granted under the LTIP with the majority being settled in a specific number of shares of common stock after the service condition has been met. The corresponding cost of services is measured based on the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit issued.\nThe value of the restricted stock units is expensed over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for restricted stock units is generally\nthree\nto\nfive years\n. However, certain restricted stock unit awards become fully vested upon the employee reaching retirement-eligibility. The value of the restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized ratably over the first\nsix months\nin the year of grant if the employee reaches retirement eligibility prior to July 1st of the grant year or  through the date of which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. Exelon processes forfeitures as they occur for employees who do not complete the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes Exelon’s nonvested restricted stock unit activity:\n261\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 20 — Stock-Based Compensation Plans\n__________\n(a)\nExcludes\n205,855\nand\n476,592\nof restricted stock units issued to retirement-eligible employees as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as they are fully vested.\n(b)\nRepresents restricted stock units that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average grant date fair value and the total fair value of restricted stock units vested.\n__________\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2023, $\n9\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of\n1.6\nyears.\nStock Options\nNon-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Exelon’s common stock were granted through 2012 under the LTIP. The exercise price of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of option grant. Stock options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.\nThere were\nno\nstock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2023.

    "text": "All Registrants—Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, each of the Registrant's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting of information in that Registrant’s periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed by the Registrants to ensure that (a) material information relating to that Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is accumulated and made known to that Registrant’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, by other employees of that Registrant and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated, and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people.\nAccordingly, as of December 31, 2023, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of the Registrants concluded that such Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish its objectives.\nAll Registrants—Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nEach Registrant continually strives to improve its disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. However, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.\nAll Registrants—Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is required to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. As a result of that assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of December 31, 2023 and, therefore, concluded that each Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA."
