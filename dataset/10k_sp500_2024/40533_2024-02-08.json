We offer a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; ship construction and repair; land combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; and technology products and services. Our leadership positions in attractive business aviation and defense markets enable us to deliver superior and enduring shareholder returns.\nOur company consists of 10 business units, which are organized into four operating segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies. We refer to the latter three collectively as our defense segments. To optimize market focus, customer intimacy, agility and operating expertise, each business unit is responsible for the development and execution of its strategy and operating results. This structure allows for a lean corporate function, which sets the overall strategy and governance for the company and is responsible for allocating and deploying capital.\nOur business units seek to deliver superior operating results by building industry-leading franchises. To achieve this goal, we invest in advanced technologies, pursue a culture of continuous improvement, and strive to be the low-cost, high-quality provider in each of our markets. The result is long-term value creation measured by strong earnings and cash flow and an attractive return on capital.\nOver the past decade, we have invested in our business to create, renew or expand our portfolio of products and services across our businesses. This includes product development investments in Aerospace to bring to market an all-new lineup of business jet aircraft, capital investments in Marine Systems to support significant growth in U.S. Navy ship and submarine construction plans over the next two decades, development of next-generation platforms and technologies to meet customers’ emerging requirements in Combat Systems, and strategic acquisitions to achieve critical mass and build out a complete spectrum of solutions for our Technologies customers. We expect to realize an attractive return from these investments in each of our segments and we will continue to evaluate our capital deployment opportunities to deliver long-term growth and enduring value to our shareholders.\nFollowing is additional information on each of our operating segments. For a supplemental discussion of segment performance and backlog, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.\nAEROSPACE\nOur Aerospace segment is recognized as a leading producer of business jets and the standard bearer in new technology aircraft, aircraft repair, support and completion services. The segment consists of our Gulfstream and Jet Aviation business units. We have earned our reputation through:\n•\nsuperior aircraft design, quality, performance, safety and reliability;\n•\ntechnologically advanced flight deck and cabin systems; and\n•\nindustry-leading customer support.\n3\nWe believe the key to long-term value creation in the business jet industry is steady investment in new aircraft models and technologies and in customer service capabilities. Since acquiring Gulfstream more than 20 years ago, we have made significant investments in research and development (R&D), state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and maintenance and support through a combination of product development efforts, capital expansion and Jet Aviation’s global support network. We are also the industry leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and energy efficient engines.\nWe are committed to continual investment in R&D to create new aircraft that consistently broaden customer offerings while raising the bar for safety and performance. The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. The Gulfstream family of aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes.\nThe following represents Gulfstream’s current product line, along with the maximum range, maximum speed, cabin length (excluding baggage), and total number of city-pair speed records held for each aircraft:\nThe most recent additions to the in-service Gulfstream fleet are two large-cabin aircraft, the G500 and G600, which entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These clean-sheet (i.e., all-new) aircraft replace the G450 and G550 models, whose combined family has an installed base of more than 1,650 aircraft around the world. Our investment included development of a new wing, new avionics,\n4\nnew fuselage and new ergonomically designed larger interiors, as well as systems and technologies to improve the manufacturing process and quality of the platform. As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, more fuel efficient, and have greater cabin volume, reduced emissions, more range and improved flight controls compared with the aircraft they are replacing. These aircraft hold more than 90 city-pair speed records, and at year-end 2023, cumulative deliveries for the aircraft totaled over 250.\nThe next model to join the Gulfstream lineup is the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700. It combines our most spacious cabin with our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck, the industry’s most technologically advanced flight deck, which we launched on our G500 and G600 aircraft, and the superior high-speed performance of all-new engines to create best-in-class capabilities. We expect the G700 to enter service following certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in early 2024.\nIn 2021, we introduced two new aircraft, the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G800 and large-cabin G400, completing a nearly two-decade effort to develop an all-new family of Gulfstream aircraft. Both aircraft combine our industry-leading high-speed range and efficiency, safety enhancements, and our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck. The G800 is Gulfstream’s longest-range aircraft, with an 8,000 nautical mile range at Mach 0.85. The G400 is a clean-sheet design developed in concert with the G500 and G600, thus expanding the commonality across the Gulfstream family of aircraft. The G400 will join a market segment in which Gulfstream has not participated for several decades. Both aircraft will enter service following FAA certification.\nThe ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G650 and G650ER continue to generate significant customer interest, with approximately 550 aircraft of this family currently operating in 55 countries. Since the first G650 entered service in 2012, its capabilities and reliability have led to significant sales and expansion of our installed base around the globe. Gulfstream’s current product line holds more than 355 city-pair speed records, more than any other business jet manufacturer, led by the G650ER, which holds the National Aeronautic Association’s polar and westbound around-the-world speed records.\nOur disciplined and consistent approach to new product development has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-market capabilities that set industry standards for safety, performance, quality, speed and comfort. Product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, composites, flight-control and vision systems, acoustics, and cabin technologies.\nGulfstream designs, develops and manufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including all large-cabin models. The mid-cabin G280 is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in Gulfstream’s U.S. facilities. As Gulfstream’s aircraft portfolio and customer base have grown and become increasingly global in reach over the years, we have invested in our facilities and operations around the world. At our Savannah campus, we added new purpose-built manufacturing facilities, increased aircraft service capacity, opened a customer-support distribution center, and expanded our R&D capabilities.\nWe offer comprehensive support for the more than 3,000 Gulfstream aircraft in service around the world and operate an extensive network of factory-owned service centers. We continue to invest in these maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities and inventory to accommodate fleet growth. We also operate a 24/7 year-round customer support center and offer on-call Gulfstream aircraft technicians ready to deploy around the world for customer service requirements under our Field and Airborne Support Team (FAST) rapid-response unit.\n5\nIn addition to expanding the reach of Gulfstream’s aircraft maintenance network outside the United States, Jet Aviation provides a comprehensive suite of innovative aircraft services for aircraft owners and operators around the world. With approximately 50 locations throughout North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, our offerings include maintenance, completion, aircraft management, charter, staffing and fixed-base operator (FBO) services.\nJet Aviation manages approximately 300 business aircraft globally on behalf of individuals and corporate owners. We operate a leading global FBO network of approximately 30 facilities on four continents and support all aircraft types with a full range of maintenance services, including 24/7 global aircraft-on-ground support. We also operate one of the world’s largest custom completion and refurbishment centers for both narrow- and wide-body aircraft and perform modifications, upgrades and lifecycle sustainment support for various government fleets. We continue to grow our global footprint through acquisitions, expansions and significant renovations in strategic business aviation markets most frequented by these customers. In 2023, we expanded hangar capacity in Scottsdale, Arizona, and in Bozeman, Montana, bringing total U.S. hangar capacity to approximately one million square feet and providing additional capacity for large-cabin aircraft.\nThe following map displays the broad reach of our combined Gulfstream and Jet Aviation services network, including authorized service centers:\nThe Aerospace segment places a priority on sustainability throughout its manufacturing and service operations, producing aircraft that maximize fuel efficiency while offering customers options to reduce or eliminate their carbon footprints. Gulfstream and Jet Aviation have been at the forefront of the industry by adopting and expanding the availability of SAF, which achieves as much as an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per gallon over its lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. Gulfstream’s service and test aircraft have flown more than two million nautical miles on SAF since 2016, and in 2019 Gulfstream became the first business jet manufacturer to make SAF available to customers. In November 2023, Gulfstream conducted the world’s first transatlantic flight using 100% SAF. Gulfstream also offers operators the ability to achieve carbon-neutral travel by facilitating the\n6\npurchase of carbon-offset credits. In addition to actively expanding the availability of SAF at its FBO locations, Jet Aviation allows customers to purchase SAF at locations where it is not available through a book-and-claim system. Since 2019, Jet Aviation has uploaded more than 10 million gallons of blended SAF to its customers.\nRevenue for the Aerospace segment was 20% of our consolidated revenue in 2023, 22% in 2022 and 21% in 2021.

Revenue by major products and services was as follows:\nCUSTOMERS\nIn 2023, 72% of our consolidated revenue was from the U.S. government, 14% was from U.S. commercial customers, 8% was from non-U.S. government customers and the remaining 6% was from non-U.S. commercial customers.\n15\nU.S. GOVERNMENT\nOur primary customer is the DoD. We also contract with other U.S. government customers, including the intelligence community and the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. Our revenue from the U.S. government was as follows:\n*\nIn addition to our direct non-U.S. sales, we sell to non-U.S. governments through the FMS program. Under the FMS program, we contract with and are paid by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government assumes the risk of collection from the non-U.S. government customer.\nOur U.S. government revenue is derived from fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Our production contracts are primarily fixed-price. Under these contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount. Contracts for research, engineering, repair and maintenance, and other services are typically cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs incurred and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. The amount for an incentive or award fee is determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials.\nOf our U.S. government revenue, fixed-price contracts accounted for 53% in 2023, 56% in 2022 and 57% in 2021; cost-reimbursement contracts accounted for 41% in 2023, 38% in 2022 and 36% in 2021; and time-and-materials contracts accounted for 6% in 2023 and 2022, and 7% in 2021.\nFor information on the advantages and disadvantages of each of these contract types, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nU.S. COMMERCIAL\nOur U.S. commercial revenue was $5.8 billion in 2023, $5.7 billion in 2022 and $4.8 billion in 2021, which represented 14%, 15% and 12% of our consolidated revenue in each of the respective years. The majority of this revenue was for business jet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries.\nNON-U.S.\nOur revenue from non-U.S. government and commercial customers was $6.1 billion in 2023, $6 billion in 2022 and $6.8 billion in 2021, which represented 14% of our consolidated revenue in 2023, 15% in 2022 and 18% in  2021.\nWe conduct business with customers around the world. Our non-U.S. defense subsidiaries maintain long-term relationships with their customers and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers, providing a broad portfolio of products and services.\nOur non-U.S. commercial revenue consists primarily of business jet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services. While the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in North America, orders from\n16\ncustomers outside North America represent a significant portion of our aircraft business with approximately 40% of the Aerospace segment’s aircraft backlog on December 31, 2023.\nCOMPETITION\nSeveral factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and business aviation markets. While customers’ evaluation criteria vary, the principal competitive elements include:\n•\nthe technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services;\n•\nour ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats;\n•\nsuccessful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems;\n•\nour global footprint and accessibility to customers;\n•\nthe reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; and\n•\nthe successful management of customer relationships.\nDEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION\nThe U.S. government contracts with numerous domestic and non-U.S. companies for products and services. We compete against other contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability. Outside the United States, we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of local, private and state-owned defense manufacturers. Our Marine Systems segment has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the Virginia-class submarine program, and to which it subcontracts on the Columbia-class submarine program. For commercial and repair work, the Marine Systems segment competes with several additional U.S. shipyards. Our Combat Systems segment competes with a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. businesses. Our Technologies segment competes with many companies, from large government contracting and commercial technology companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise. The operating cycle of many of our major programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully.\nWe are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors. Competitions for major defense and other government contracting programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements. Opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator, overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team, or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem.\nBUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT MARKET COMPETITION\nThe Aerospace segment has several competitors for each of its Gulfstream products. Key competitive factors include aircraft safety, reliability and performance; comfort and in-flight productivity; service quality, global footprint and responsiveness; technological and new-product innovation; and price. We believe that Gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas.\nThe Aerospace segment competes worldwide in the business jet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of quality, price and timeliness. While competition for each type of service varies somewhat, the segment faces a number of competitors of varying sizes for each of its offerings.\n17\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe develop technology, manufacturing processes and systems-integration practices. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to and from others. The U.S. government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents. Although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business, no existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nOur company is a global community of approximately 111,600 employees dedicated to our Ethos of transparency, trust, honesty and alignment. These four core values drive how we operate our business; govern how we interact with each other, our customers, partners and suppliers; guide the way that we treat our workforce; and determine how we connect with our communities. Our commitment to ethical business practices is outlined in our\nStandards of Business Ethics and Conduct\n, which states our expectation that all employees conduct business in accordance with our Ethos, applicable laws and our policies. Each employee is asked to acknowledge receipt, understanding of and compliance with our standards.\nDue to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and train skilled and qualified people to design and build the products and perform the services required by our customers. This includes upskilling employees to advance within the workplace. The health, welfare and safety of our employees is paramount throughout our workplaces. This effort starts with treating all employees with dignity and respect and providing them with fair, market-based, competitive and equitable compensation. We recognize and reward the performance of our employees in line with our pay-for-performance philosophy and provide a comprehensive suite of benefit options that aim to enable our employees and their dependents to live healthy and productive lives.\nAcross our businesses, we take measures to prevent workplace hazards, encourage healthy and safe behaviors and enforce a culture of continuous improvement to ensure that our processes help reduce safety incidents and illnesses and comply with applicable health and safety laws.\nWe recognize that our success as a company depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified people. Our commitment to promoting diversity of thought, experience, perspectives, backgrounds and capabilities to drive innovation strengthens the solutions we deliver to our customers. General Dynamics works hard to promote an environment that values and supports all employees. We proudly support a work environment that respects diverse opinions, values individual skills, celebrates unique experiences and cultivates teamwork. These efforts are a demonstration of our dedication to equal employment opportunities that foster and support a principled, productive and inclusive work environment. We stand for basic universal human rights, including that employment must be voluntary. We track, measure and analyze our workforce trends to establish accountability for putting people first across our businesses and at every level of our company.\nOur values motivate us to promote strong workplace practices with opportunities for development and training. Our training and development efforts focus on ensuring that our people are appropriately trained on critical job skills as well as on leadership behaviors that are consistent with our Ethos. We conduct rigorous succession planning exercises to ensure that key positions have the appropriate level of\n18\nbench strength to provide for future key positions and leadership transitions. We listen to our people to assess areas of concern and levels of engagement.\n2023 WORKFORCE STATISTICS\n•\nApproximately 84% of our employees are based in the United States, of which roughly 70% are white, 30% are people of color, 19% are veterans of the U.S. armed forces and 8% have self-reported having a disability. The remaining 16% of our workforce is based internationally in over 65 countries with the primary concentrations being in North America and Europe. Approximately 22% of our workforce is represented by collective bargaining agreements. In 2023, we renewed the collective bargaining agreements for the majority of our represented employees.\n•\nOur global workforce is 76% male and 24% female, and our senior leadership teams across the business are represented by 73% males and 27% females. During 2023, the diversity profile of our workforce continued to improve across our businesses, as we hired more than 23,400 individuals of which 73% were male and 27% were female. For our approximately 19,400 U.S.-based hires in 2023, 60% were white and 40% were people of color.\nRAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS\nWe depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials, components and subsystems. Our U.S. government customer is a supplier for some of our programs. These supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints, which can put pressure on our costs. Effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance. If our sources of supply are disrupted, particularly in instances where we rely on only one or two sources of supply, or in the event that international conflicts result in the disruption of manufacturing or trade relations for some supply components, our ability to meet our customer commitments could be adversely impacted. We attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into long-term agreements and leveraging company-wide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nU.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) govern the majority of our contracts. The FAR mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. government acquisitions and purchased services. Also, individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR. For example, the DoD implements the FAR through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). For all federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including:\n•\nacquisition planning;\n•\ncompetition requirements;\n•\ncontractor qualifications;\n•\nprotection of source selection and supplier information; and\n•\nacquisition procedures.\n19\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\nNON-U.S. REGULATORY\nOur non-U.S. operations are subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\nBUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness. Aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority, which is often accomplished through a supplemental type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\nENVIRONMENTAL\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency. As a PRP, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination. In cases where we have been designated a PRP, we generally seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate cost-recovery actions. In the unlikely event that we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other PRPs. We regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters.\nOperating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. Historically, these costs have not been material. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, the timing and effect of which are difficult to assess.\nChanges in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs or facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs. Environmental costs are often recoverable under our contracts with the U.S. government. Based on information currently available and current U.S. government policies relating to cost recovery, we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations, including costs associated with changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, to have a material impact on our\n20\nresults of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters, see Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe file reports and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). These reports and information include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements. Free copies of these items, and any amendments to those items filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are made available on our website (gd.com) as soon as practicable after we electronically file such items with, or furnish them to, the SEC. The SEC maintains a website (sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information.\nIn addition to the information contained in this Form 10-K, information about the company can be found on our website and our Investor Relations website (investorrelations.gd.com). Our Investor Relations website contains a significant amount of information about the company, including financial information, our corporate governance principles and practices, and other information for investors. We encourage investors to visit our website, as we frequently update and post new information about our company, and it is possible that this information could be deemed material information.\nReferences to our website and the SEC’s website in this Form 10-K do not constitute, and should not be viewed as, incorporation by reference of the information contained on, or available through, the websites. The information should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K, unless otherwise expressly incorporated by reference."

    "text": "An investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. Investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our securities.\nInvestment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. The market risks faced by an investor in our securities are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. There are some risks that apply more specifically to our business.\nOur revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government. This customer relationship involves some specific risks. In addition, our sales to non-U.S. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. Despite the varying nature of our government and commercial operations and the markets they serve, each segment shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe U.S. government provides a significant portion of our revenue.\nIn 2023, approximately 70% of our consolidated revenue was from the U.S. government. Levels of U.S. defense spending may be impacted by numerous factors, such as the domestic political environment, changes in national and international priorities, and threats to national security. Competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending. Decreases in U.S. government defense and other spending or\n21\nchanges in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance.\nFor additional information relating to U.S. government budget and funding matters, see the Business Environment section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.\nU.S. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay.\nOur U.S. government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an October-to-September fiscal year. Early each calendar year, the President of the United States presents to the Congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. This budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. For the remainder of the year, the Appropriations and Authorization Committees of the Congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. Once these levels are enacted into law, the Executive Office of the President administers the funds to the agencies.\nThere are two primary risks associated with the U.S. government budget cycle. First, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted. If the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the U.S. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels, which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards. Second, the Congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. Future revenue under existing multi-year contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. Changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content.\nGovernment contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer.\nU.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. If a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. The government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. If a contract is terminated for default, the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted. Many foreign contracts have similar termination rights by customers. The termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings.\nGovernment contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the U.S. government.\nNumerous U.S. government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. government also reviews the adequacy of, and compliance with, internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, material, earned value management and accounting systems. In some cases, audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. If an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities, civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made. In some cases, audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements, arbitration or litigation. Moreover, new laws, regulations or standards, or\n22\nchanges to existing ones, can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our revenue and earnings.\nOur Aerospace segment is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft.\nThe\nbusiness jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by corporate, individual and government customers in the United States and around the world. Customer demand can be affected by a number of factors, including changes in general economic conditions, the availability and cost of credit, pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets. An adverse change in customer demand for our business-aviation products and services could materially affect our future revenue and earnings. In addition, if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced, the segment’s anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially.\nEarnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts.\nWhen agreeing to contractual terms, our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events. The accounting for our contracts requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events. These projections and estimates assess, among other things:\n•\nthe productivity and availability of labor;\n•\nthe complexity of the work to be performed;\n•\nthe cost and availability of materials and components; and\n•\nschedule requirements.\nIf there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances, estimates or assumptions, or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately, the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected. This could affect earnings and margin materially.\nRevenue, earnings and margin depend in part on supplier performance.\nWe rely on other companies and our government customers to provide materials, components and subsystems for our products. Suppliers, including subcontractors, sometimes perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these suppliers and government entities to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law. Misconduct by suppliers, such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities, may harm our future revenue, earnings and margin.\nWe sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply, and any disruption in our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments. For example, some of our operating segments rely on the supply of semiconductors for the manufacture of our products, and any inability of or delay by our suppliers to meet our order demands (including due to the suppliers’ competing commercial priorities, any military conflict resulting in a disruption of manufacturing or trade relations, or any other business disruption) could delay or disrupt our ability to procure semiconductors. Our ability to perform our obligations to our customers, and our future revenue, earnings and margin, may be materially adversely affected if (1) any one or more of our suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon materials, or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or engages in misconduct or other improper activities or (2) we are unable to otherwise obtain necessary materials, components, subsystems or services in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers.\nMany of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system-integration processes. Our customers’ requirements change and evolve\n23\nregularly. Accordingly, our performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. Many of our new products must meet extensive and time-consuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control and may result in unanticipated delays. Additionally, due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers and to develop and manufacture our products. To the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees. If we were unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our International Operations\nOperations outside the United States are subject to various risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nIn some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political instability, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. Our non-U.S. operations may be sensitive to and impacted by (1) changes in a foreign government’s national policies and priorities, political leadership and budgets, which may be influenced by changes in threat environments, geopolitical uncertainties, volatility in economic conditions and other economic and political factors including inflationary pressures; (2) changes in U.S., foreign, and international laws, regulations, and policies; (3) energy, natural resource and other commodity shortages; and (4) global trade disputes and supply chain disruptions. For example, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in the imposition of numerous economic and trade sanctions, export controls, and other restrictions targeting Russia and Belarus, and the Russian government has implemented counter-sanctions and export controls targeting the U.S. and various foreign countries in which we operate. These actions have caused some economic disruptions around the world and have exacerbated global supply chain challenges. Changes and developments in any of these matters or factors may occur suddenly and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments.\nNon-U.S. transactions can involve increased risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability, which could, among other things, negatively impact sales and the translation of our international revenue from local currencies into U.S. dollars, and differing legal systems. Our non-U.S. operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). An unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with U.S. or foreign laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings.\nIn addition, some non-U.S. government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements. We may also be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy investment or other commitments or face penalties. Offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these commitments. If we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected.\n24\nRisks Relating to Our Acquisitions and Similar Investment Activities\nWe have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties.\nWhen evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved; the performance of the underlying products, capabilities, or technologies; market conditions following the acquisition; and acquired liabilities, including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition. These factors could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired.\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business. We review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50%. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. We face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including the risk factors discussed in this section. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets. Future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOther Business and Operational Risks\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity events and other disruptions.\nWe face various cybersecurity threats, including threats to our IT infrastructure and attempts to gain unauthorized access to our proprietary or classified information, denial-of-service attacks, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts. We also design and manage IT systems and products for various customers. We generally face the same security threats for these systems and products as for our own internal systems. In addition, we face cybersecurity threats from entities and persons that may seek to target us through our customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. Many of these cybersecurity threats are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. Accordingly, we maintain information security staff, policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems, and we review and update our policies, procedures and practices in light of evolving threats. We conduct employee training on cybersecurity to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats, and we report cybersecurity events or losses of customer data to affected customers and applicable regulatory authorities. However, there can be no assurance that any such actions, including the timeliness of our efforts to review, update or implement policies, procedures and practices in light of evolving threats, or the safeguards put in place by our customers, suppliers and other parties on which we rely, will be sufficient to detect, prevent and mitigate cybersecurity breaches or disruptions, or the unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data.\nWe have experienced cybersecurity events and disruptions such as viruses and attacks targeting our IT systems. Such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, future threats could have a materially adverse impact on our company by, among other things, causing harm to our business, financial condition, results of operations or\n25\nreputation; disrupting our operations; exposing us to potential liability, regulatory actions and loss of business; and challenging our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.\nOur business may continue to be negatively impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and could be negatively impacted by other pandemics and outbreaks.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. This includes disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work effectively, temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers, and the imposition of quarantine and travel restrictions that have and may in the future negatively affect demand for our products and services and result in supply-chain disruptions. Any such effects could materially adversely affect our ability to perform on our contracts. Any cost increases that result from these effects may not be fully recoverable on our contracts or adequately covered by insurance.\nOther outbreaks of contagious diseases, including new variants of COVID-19, or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate or our customers are located, could similarly adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nGlobal climate change could negatively affect our business.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in state, federal or international requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming, such as the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms, stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, or other business restrictions or compliance requirements regarding reducing or mitigating global climate change. If environmental or climate-change laws or regulations are adopted or changed that directly or indirectly impose significant new costs, operational restrictions or compliance requirements on our business, products, customers or suppliers, they could increase our costs, require additional capital expenditures, reduce our margins and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, while we continuously evaluate and seek opportunities to improve our climate-related measures, there can be no assurance that changes in customer demand patterns and competition, as well as potential reputational risks, related to climate change will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “believes,” “forecasts,” “scheduled,” “outlook,” “estimates,” “should” and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

    "text": "We face various cybersecurity threats. The purpose of our cybersecurity program is to assess, identify, manage and mitigate cybersecurity risk while supporting the achievement of our business objectives.\nUnder our comprehensive risk management program, the board of directors (Board) of the company maintains oversight of the most significant risks facing the company, including cybersecurity risks, while senior management is responsible for the identification and prioritization of risks that are material to our business, corresponding risk-mitigation efforts and day-to-day management of our risk management program. The full Board retains oversight over management’s cybersecurity efforts. At least annually, and often more frequently, the Board receives cybersecurity briefings from senior executives, including, when appropriate, executives focused on cybersecurity matters.\nOur companywide cybersecurity policy sets the framework for our approach to cybersecurity. Each business unit and our corporate headquarters designates individuals with appropriate qualifications and experience to be responsible for addressing cybersecurity matters, including assessing, identifying and managing risks from cybersecurity threats, with a direct reporting line to senior management. Under our approach to cybersecurity, each business unit designs and operates its own information and cybersecurity program tailored to its market, customer requirements, regulatory requirements and threats. Our cybersecurity policy and procedures are designed to ensure senior management receives timely and adequate information regarding cybersecurity matters, including threats and incident response, as appropriate to the matter. Our policies and procedures are also designed to oversee and identify material cybersecurity risks related to third-party vendors and service providers.\nOur companywide Cyber Council, comprised of information technology and cybersecurity executives from our business units, shares information and cybersecurity practices throughout the company, recommends policy and procedure updates and tracks emerging trends. The chair of the Cyber Council reports directly to the company’s chief executive officer.\nAs part of our approach to cyber risk management, we regularly perform internal audits of internal processes and controls relating to cybersecurity. From time to time, as appropriate under our overall cybersecurity program, we engage third-party experts to support the assessment of cyber related risks, including to conduct cyber penetration testing.\n27\nSee Item 1A—Risk Factors above for additional discussion of various risks related to cybersecurity that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition."

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2023 compared with 2022 should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, while a discussion of 2022 compared with 2021 can be found in Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nGLOBAL EVENTS\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities, including supply chain and staffing challenges. Additionally, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions, export controls and other restrictions (collectively, global sanctions) targeting Russia and Belarus. The conflict and these sanctions have caused some disruptions to global economies and some global businesses, including heightened cybersecurity risks, increased energy costs and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as exacerbated existing supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures. Lastly, the impact of the war between Israel and Hamas continues to evolve.\nThe disruptions caused by these events continue to impact global economies and businesses. The primary impact to our business is supply chain challenges, including inflationary pressures. In our Aerospace segment, supply chain challenges have paced our ability to ramp up production in response to strong customer demand for our aircraft and have caused out-of-sequence manufacturing, which increases costs and decreases operational efficiency. This includes the Israel-Hamas war’s impact on our Israel-based supplier of mid-cabin aircraft. Within our defense segments, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in supply chain challenges and impacted the regional availability of skilled labor, which we continue to experience, particularly in our Marine Systems segment. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and increased threat environment has created additional demand for our products and services, particularly in our Combat Systems segment.\nAny longer-term impact of these global events to our business is currently unknown due to the uncertainty around duration and their broader impact. For additional information, see the Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.\nOUR MARKETS\nWith approximately 70% of our revenue from the U.S. government, government spending levels\n—\nparticularly defense spending\n—\ninfluence our financial performance. The Congress has not yet passed a defense appropriations bill for the government’s current fiscal year. However, the government has been operating under a continuing resolution (CR) that provides funding for some federal agencies through March 1, 2024, and other federal agencies through March 8, 2024. When the government operates under a CR, all programs of record are funded at the prior year’s appropriated levels until the current year appropriations bill is signed into law. Therefore, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is prohibited\n33\nfrom starting new programs or increasing funding on existing programs unless there is an exception for the program included in the CR. The current CR included an exception allowing the DoD to obligate funds for the construction of the second submarine under the existing Columbia-class submarine program. We do not anticipate the current CR having a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the impact to our business from an extended CR or government shutdown that may result from any continuing delay by Congress to pass a new defense appropriations bill would depend on the duration and government implementation of the CR or shutdown.\nThe long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the U.S. military’s funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution.\nInternational demand for military equipment and technologies presents opportunities for our non-U.S. operations and exports from our North American businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, there are risks to doing business in foreign countries, including changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country.\nIn our Aerospace segment, we expect our investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the segment’s long-term growth. Similarly, we believe our aircraft services business will be a source of steady revenue growth as the global business jet fleet continues to grow.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following paragraphs explain how we recognize revenue and operating costs in our operating segments and the terminology we use to describe our operating results.\nIn the Aerospace segment, we record revenue on contracts for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft. Revenue associated with the segment’s services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries, and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period.\nThe majority of the Aerospace segment’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots, recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace segment’s services businesses are recognized generally as incurred.\nFor new aircraft, operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of ultra-large-cabin, large-cabin and mid-cabin aircraft deliveries. Aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft models. A new aircraft model typically has lower margins in its initial production lots, and then margins generally increase as we realize efficiencies in the production process.\n34\nAdditional factors affecting the segment’s earnings and margin include the volume, mix and profitability of services work performed, the market for pre-owned aircraft, and the level of general and administrative (G&A) and net research and development (R&D) costs incurred by the segment.\nIn the defense segments, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized generally over time as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&A expenses. Variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts. Because costs are used as a measure of progress, year-over-year variances in costs result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volume.\nOperating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the estimated costs to complete the contract or both. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value (or vice versa) that the profitability of that contract may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- versus lower-margin work. Higher or lower margins can result from a number of factors, including contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) and type of work (e.g., development/production). Contract mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our long-term production contracts. New long-term production contracts typically have lower margins initially, and then margins generally increase as we achieve learning curve improvements or realize other cost reductions.\nCONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW\n2023 IN REVIEW\n•\nStrong operating performance:\n◦\nRecord-high revenue of $42.3 billion, an increase of 7.3% from 2022\n◦\nOperating earnings of $4.2 billion with sequential growth throughout the year\n◦\nRecord-high cash provided by operating activities of $4.7 billion, or 142% of net earnings\n•\nRecord-high year-end backlog of $93.6 billion increased $2.5 billion, or 2.7%, from 2022, driven by significant order activity during the year supporting our long-term growth expectations:\n◦\nStrong Gulfstream aircraft order activity, including orders across all aircraft models\n◦\nSeveral significant contract awards received in our defense segments, including $3 billion of combined awards from the U.S. Navy for advance procurement and other work for the Virginia-class submarine program\n35\nOur consolidated revenue increased in 2023 driven by growth in each of our defense segments, particularly submarine construction and engineering in our Marine Systems segment. Operating margin decreased in 2023 due primarily to supply-chain cost pressure in our Marine Systems segment and lower-margin artillery facilities expansion work in our Combat Systems segment.\nREVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS\nFollowing is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our operating segments. For the Aerospace segment, results are analyzed by specific types of products and services, consistent with how the segment is managed. For the defense segments, the discussion is based on markets and the lines of products and services offered with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the results. Additional information regarding our segments can be found in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nAEROSPACE\nOperating Results\nThe increase in the Aerospace segment’s revenue in 2023 consisted of the following:\nAircraft services revenue was higher in 2023 due to an increase in demand for maintenance work based on established maintenance cycles, a larger installed base of aircraft, and strong customer flight activity. Aircraft manufacturing revenue decreased in 2023 due primarily to fewer deliveries of our large-cabin aircraft resulting from supply chain constraints.\n36\nThe increase in the segment’s operating earnings in 2023 consisted of the following:\nAircraft services operating earnings were up in 2023 due to higher volume and a favorable mix of services. While aircraft manufacturing operating earnings in 2023 reflected the impact of higher production costs resulting from supply chain challenges, 2022 earnings were impacted to a greater extent by customer accommodation costs associated with a G500/G600 airworthiness directive. G&A expenses decreased in 2023, offset partially by increased R&D expenses associated with ongoing product development efforts, particularly those related to the G700 certification. In total, the Aerospace segment’s operating margin increased 50 basis points in 2023 to 13.7%.\n2024 Outlook\nWe expect the Aerospace segment’s 2024 revenue to increase to approximately $12 billion due to an increase in new aircraft deliveries to approximately 160, including the entry into service of the new G700 aircraft. We expect the segment’s operating margin to be approximately 15%.\nMARINE SYSTEMS\nOperating Results\nThe increase in the Marine Systems segment’s revenue in 2023 consisted of the following:\nRevenue from U.S. Navy ship construction and engineering was up in 2023 due primarily to increased volume on the Columbia-class submarine program. The Marine Systems segment’s operating margin decreased 110 basis points in 2023 due to supply chain impacts to the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost growth on the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer program.\n2024 Outlook\nWe expect the Marine Systems segment’s 2024 revenue to increase to approximately $12.8-12.9 billion with operating margin of approximately 7.6%.\n37\nCOMBAT SYSTEMS\nOperating Results\nThe increase in the Combat Systems segment’s revenue in 2023 consisted of the following:\nRevenue from international military vehicles increased in 2023 due to higher volume on several wheeled and tracked vehicle contracts, including the sale of the Abrams main battle tank to U.S. allies and partners. Weapons systems and munitions revenue was up due to increased demand and facility expansion efforts associated with increased artillery production. Revenue from U.S. military vehicles increased due primarily to higher volume on the U.S. Army’s M10 Booker combat vehicle program (formerly known as Mobile Protected Firepower). The Combat Systems segment’s operating margin decreased 80 basis points compared with 2022 driven primarily by lower-margin artillery facilities expansion work.\n2024 Outlook\nWe expect the Combat Systems segment’s 2024 revenue to increase to approximately $8.5 billion with operating margin of approximately 14.4%.\nTECHNOLOGIES\n38\nOperating Results\nThe increase in the Technologies segment’s revenue in 2023 consisted of the following:\n*\nCommand, control, communications, computers, cyber, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance\nThe Technologies segment’s revenue was up due primarily to strong demand for IT services and the acquisition of a C5ISR solutions business in 2022. Overall, the segment’s margin decreased 50 basis points compared with 2022 due to program mix.\n2024 Outlook\nWe expect the Technologies segment’s 2024 revenue to increase to $13 billion with operating margin of around 9.5%.\nCORPORATE\nCorporate operating costs totaled $160 in 2023 and $118 in 2022 and consisted primarily of equity-based compensation expense. Corporate operating costs are expected to be approximately $125 in 2024.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nPRODUCT AND SERVICE REVENUE AND OPERATING COSTS\nThe increase in product revenue in 2023 consisted of the following:\nShip construction revenue increased due primarily to higher volume on the Columbia-class submarine program. Military vehicle production revenue was up due primarily to higher volume on several international wheeled and tracked vehicle contracts. Weapons systems and munitions revenue was up due to increased demand and facility expansion efforts associated with increased artillery\n39\nproduction. In 2023, product operating costs increased at a higher rate than revenue due to supply chain impacts and cost growth within our Marine Systems segment.\nThe increase in service revenue in 2023 consisted of the following:\nServices revenue increased in 2023 due to a higher volume of engineering work on the Columbia-class submarine program, increased demand for IT services and additional aircraft maintenance work. In 2023, the primary driver of the increase in service operating costs was the change in volume described above.\nG&A EXPENSES\nAs a percentage of revenue, G&A expenses decreased to 5.7% in 2023 compared with 6.1% in 2022 due to growth in revenue. We expect G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2024 to be generally consistent with 2023.\nOTHER, NET\nNet other income was $82 in 2023 and $189 in 2022 and represents primarily the non-service components of pension and other post-retirement benefits. The decrease in pension income was driven primarily by higher interest rates and a change in investment mix in one of our plans due to its improved funded status. In 2024, we expect net other income to be approximately $50.\nINTEREST, NET\nNet interest expense was $343 in 2023 and $364 in 2022, reflecting the repayment of our scheduled debt maturities in 2023 and 2022. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including interest rates. We expect 2024 net interest expense to be approximately $320.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAX, NET\nOur effective tax rate increased to 16.8% in 2023 from 16% in 2022. For further discussion, including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate, see Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. For 2024, we anticipate a slightly higher full-year effective tax rate of approximately 17.5%. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2023 and the expected increase in 2024 are due principally to higher taxes on foreign earnings.\nBACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE\nOur total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $93.6 billion on December 31, 2023, compared to $91.1 billion at the end of 2022. Our total backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts with customers as discussed in Note B to the Consolidated Financial\n40\nStatements in Item 8. Our total estimated contract value, which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value, was $132 billion on December 31, 2023.\nThe following table details the backlog and estimated potential contract value of each segment at the end of 2023 and 2022:\nFor additional information about our major products and services in backlog see the Business discussion contained in Item 1.\nAEROSPACE\nAerospace funded backlog represents primarily new aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers. Unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Aerospace segment ended 2023 with backlog of $20.5 billion, up 4.8% from $19.5 billion at year-end 2022.\nOrders in 2023 reflected strong demand across our portfolio of products and services, including orders for all models of Gulfstream aircraft. The segment’s book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenue) was 1.2-to-1 in 2023.\nBeyond total backlog, estimated potential contract value represents primarily options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase new aircraft and long-term aircraft services agreements. On December 31, 2023, estimated potential contract value in the Aerospace segment was $451.\nDemand for Gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions, generating orders from public and privately held companies, individuals, and governments around the world. Geographically, U.S. customers represented 68% of the segment’s orders in 2023 and 59% of the segment’s backlog on December 31, 2023, demonstrating continued strong domestic demand.\n41\nThe following represents Gulfstream aircraft (in units) in backlog by region on December 31, 2023:\nDEFENSE SEGMENTS\nThe total backlog in our defense segments represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of total backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by customers, as well as commitments by international customers that are approved and funded similarly by their governments. The unfunded portion of total backlog includes the amounts we believe are likely to be funded, but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the same funding level currently anticipated for a given program.\nEstimated potential contract value in our defense segments includes unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts and unfunded work on indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Contract options represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. For IDIQ contracts, we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value. This amount is often less than the total IDIQ contract value, particularly when the contract has multiple awardees. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value.\nTotal backlog in our defense segments was $73.2 billion on December 31, 2023, compared with $71.6 billion at year-end 2022. In 2023, the total book-to-bill ratio in our defense segments was slightly above 1-to-1. Estimated potential contract value in our defense segments was $37.9 billion on December 31, 2023, compared with $35.9 billion at year-end 2022.\n42\nMARINE SYSTEMS\nThe Marine Systems segment’s backlog consists of very long-term submarine and surface ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts. The segment’s backlog and estimated potential contract value remained steady compared with year-end 2022.\nSignificant contract awards in the Marine Systems segment during 2023 include:\n•\n$1.7 billion from the U.S. Navy for lead yard services, development studies and design efforts, procurement and delivery of initial spare parts to support maintenance availabilities for Virginia-class submarines.\n•\n$300 for advanced nuclear plant studies (ANPS) in support of the Columbia-class submarine program. The contracts, including options, have a maximum potential value of $1.5 billion.\n•\n$1.3 billion from the Navy for long-lead materials and advance construction for Block V and long-lead materials for Block VI Virginia-class submarines.\n•\n$720 from the Navy to provide maintenance and modernization services for the DDG-51 destroyer, San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock and Wasp-class amphibious assault ship programs. The awards including options have a maximum potential value of $1.2 billion.\n•\n$735 from the Navy for construction of an additional John Lewis-class (T-AO-205) fleet replenishment oiler.\n•\n$95 from the Navy to provide maintenance and support non-nuclear maintenance on submarines based at the New London Naval Submarine Support Facility in Connecticut. The awards have a maximum potential value of $460.\n•\nA contract from the Navy to provide ongoing lead yard services for the DDG-51 program. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $420.\n•\n$220 from the Navy to provide in-service support of systems and components on the USS Jimmy Carter (SSN 23).\n•\nA contract from the Navy for the construction of three Flight III DDG-51 destroyers.\n43\nThe following represents the Marine Systems segment’s total estimated contract value by major program on December 31, 2023:\nCOMBAT SYSTEMS\nThe Combat Systems segment’s backlog consists of a mix of U.S. and international combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions programs. The vehicle programs are generally long-term franchise programs, while the weapons systems and munitions programs tend to be shorter-term in nature. The segment’s backlog was up 9.7% from year-end 2022 to $14.5 billion. The segment’s estimated potential contract value was $6.2 billion on December 31, 2023, compared with $5.4 billion at year-end 2022.\nSignificant contract awards in the Combat Systems segment during 2023 include:\n•\n$1.7 billion for various munitions and ordnance. The awards have a maximum potential value of $3.2 billion.\n•\n$1 billion from the U.S. Army to establish additional capacity for 155mm projectile metal parts and M795 load, assemble and pack (LAP) production and artillery propellant. The contracts, including follow-on production, have a maximum potential value of $2.4 billion.\n•\n$920 from the Army for Stryker vehicle upgrades, spare parts, and inventory management and support services.\n•\n$695 from the Army to advance to the detailed design and prototype build and test phases of the XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle (MICV) competition, formerly known as the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV). The award including options has a maximum potential value of $770.\n•\n$755 from the Army to upgrade Abrams main battle tanks to the system enhancement package version 3 (SEPv3) configuration and provide system and sustainment technical support services for the Abrams program.\n44\n•\n$305 to produce light armored vehicles (LAVs) and provide the associated spares and logistics support services for Colombia.\n•\n$260 from the Army for the second phase of low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the M10 Booker Combat Vehicle.\n•\n$230 to provide maintenance and modernization for the Leopard fleet of vehicles for the Spanish Ministry of Defence.\n•\n$205 to produce Abrams main battle tanks in the SEPv3 configuration for Poland, bringing the total firm backlog for the program to $1.1 billion.\nThe following represents the Combat Systems segment’s total estimated contract value by market on December 31, 2023:\nTECHNOLOGIES\nThe Technologies segment’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and task orders across a mix of U.S. and non-U.S. government and commercial customers. These contracts can be shorter-cycle or span multiple years, but commonly include a small, initially funded order. Therefore, our estimated potential contract value of $28 billion is an important indicator of future orders and revenue. In 2023, approximately 80% of the segment’s orders were from additional work on IDIQ contracts or the exercise of options. The segment’s total estimated contract value was $40.8 billion on December 31, 2023, compared with $39.6 billion at year-end 2022.\n45\nSignificant contract awards in the Technologies segment during 2023 include:\n•\nAn IDIQ contract to provide full spectrum security support services to protect mission critical infrastructure for the U.S. Air Force. The contract has a maximum potential value of $4.5 billion between two awardees.\n•\n$1.4 billion for several key classified contracts. The contracts have a maximum potential value of $3.1 billion.\n•\nAn IDIQ contract from the Indian Health Service (IHS) to modernize its electronic health record (EHR) system. The contract has a maximum potential value of $2.5 billion.\n•\n$130 to provide flight simulation and training services for the Army. The contract has a maximum potential value of $1.7 billion.\n•\nAn IDIQ contract to provide mission command training and technical support services for the Army. The contract has a maximum potential value of $975 among multiple awardees.\n•\n$55 to continue infrastructure modernization of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) St. Elizabeth’s Campus in Washington, D.C. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $710.\n•\n$95 from U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to provide a full range of activities to support USSOCOM operations, including program management, mission infrastructure and training services. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $490.\n•\nAn IDIQ contract to provide sustainment services, spare parts and obsolescence risk management services, and system readiness for the Army’s Prophet Enhanced sensor systems. The contract has a maximum potential value of $480.\n•\nA contract from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to continue operating and modernizing the agency’s Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) application. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $450.\n46\nThe following represents the Technologies segment’s total estimated contract value by customer on December 31, 2023:\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation, which is underpinned by an operating discipline focused on cost control and working capital management. This emphasis gives us the flexibility for prudent capital deployment, while allowing us to step down debt over time, and preserves a strong balance sheet for future opportunities.\nWe evaluate a variety of capital deployment options based on current market conditions and our long-term outlook, and we believe agility is a key component of our capital deployment strategy as market conditions change over time. Our capital deployment priorities include investments in our products and services to drive long-term growth, a predictable dividend, strategic acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases.\nWe believe cash generated by operating activities, supplemented by commercial paper issuances, is sufficient to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs. An additional potential source of capital is the issuance of long-term debt in capital market transactions.\n47\nWe ended 2023 with a cash and equivalents balance of $1.9 billion compared with $1.2 billion at the end of 2022. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities in 2023 and 2022, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Item 8:\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.7 billion in 2023\ncompared with\n$4.6 billion in 2022\n.\nThe primary driver of cash inflows in both years was net earnings. Cash flows in both periods were affected positively by an increase in customer deposits driven by Gulfstream aircraft orders, offset partially by an increase in inventory due primarily to new aircraft models awaiting certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Cash flows in 2023 were also affected positively by a decrease in unbilled receivables due to the receipt of progress payments on large international vehicle contracts in our Combat Systems segment.\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES\nCash used by investing activities was $941 in 2023 and $1.5 billion in 2022. Our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions; purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities; and proceeds from asset sales.\nCapital Expenditures.\nThe primary use of cash for investing activities in both years was capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $904 in 2023 and\n$1.1 billion in 2022. Capital expenditures include equipment and facility enhancements to support new and existing programs across our businesses.\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES\nCash used by financing activities was $3.1 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in 2022. Financing activities include the use of cash for repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends, and debt and commercial paper repayments. Our financing activities also include proceeds received from debt and commercial paper issuances and employee stock option exercises.\nDividends.\nOn March 8, 2023, our board of directors (Board) declared an increased quarterly dividend of $1.32 per share, the 26th consecutive annual increase. Previously, the Board had increased the quarterly dividend to $1.26 per share in March 2022. Cash dividends paid were $1.4 billion in 2023 and 2022.\nShare Repurchases.\nOur Board from time to time authorizes management to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market. We paid $434 and $1.2 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively, to repurchase our outstanding shares. On December 31, 2023, 4.7 million shares remained authorized by our Board for repurchase, representing 1.7% of our total shares outstanding.\n48\nDebt Issuances and Repayments.\nIn May and August 2023, we repaid fixed-rate notes of $750 and $500, respectively, and in November 2022, we repaid fixed-rate notes of $1 billion, all at their respective scheduled maturities using cash on hand. Fixed-rate notes of $500 mature in November 2024. We currently plan to repay these notes at maturity using cash on hand, potentially supplemented by commercial paper or other borrowings. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates, see Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nOn December 31, 2023, we had no commercial paper outstanding, but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future. Separately, we have a $4 billion committed bank credit facility for general corporate purposes and working capital needs and to support our commercial paper issuances. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows us to access the debt markets.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) to measure our performance in these areas. While we believe these metrics provide useful information, they are not defined operating measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and there are limitations associated with their use. Our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. As a result, the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP measures.\nFree Cash Flow.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Item 8:\nReturn on Invested Capital.\nWe believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as net earnings plus after-tax interest and amortization expense, calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and average shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss. Average debt and average shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss are calculated using the\n49\nrespective balances at the end of the preceding year and the respective balances at the end of each of the four quarters of the year presented. ROIC excludes goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance.\nROIC is calculated as follows:\nCASH REQUIREMENTS\nThe following is a discussion of how we expect to meet the future cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. We similarly enter into long-term agreements with suppliers and subcontractors for goods and services in support of these contracts and programs with payment terms that are generally aligned with the payment terms from our customers. In some instances, we require advance payments or deposits from our customers, which help fund our purchase commitments and reduce the risk of customer performance.\nAdditionally, we have significant liabilities under our defined benefit retirement plans. As these liabilities are settled using plan assets, our future cash requirements associated with these liabilities are generally limited to the annual cash contributions to these plans required in accordance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations. See Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.\nOther obligations, such as scheduled principal and interest payments on our fixed-rate notes, and scheduled payments in accordance with our lease agreements are expected to be satisfied using cash generated from operations. See Notes J and K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.\nADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We employ judgment in making our estimates, but they are based on historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We\n50\nbelieve our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts our results of operations for all periods presented.\nIn our opinion, the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application:\nRevenue.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account for revenue. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time.\nSubstantially all of our revenue in the defense segments is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customers. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer.\nMost of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our Aerospace segment. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. For discussion of our contract estimates, the assumptions used, and the impact of changes in estimates, see Footnote B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nConsistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term contracts as current, even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year. The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nLong-lived Assets and Goodwill.\nWe review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows.\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50%. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. When determining the approach to be used, we consider the current facts and circumstances of each\n51\nreporting unit as well as the excess of each reporting unit’s estimated fair value over its carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessments. Our qualitative approach evaluates the business environment and various events impacting the reporting unit including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, changes in the business environment and reporting unit-specific events. If, based on the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, then a quantitative assessment is not necessary. However, if a quantitative assessment is determined to be necessary, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and, if necessary, recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nOur estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value is based primarily on the discounted cash flows of the underlying operations and requires the use of judgment by management. The process requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows, and terminal-value growth rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows. Due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis. To assess the reasonableness of our discounted cash flows, we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization. Additionally, we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit’s fair value by comparing the fair value to peer companies and recent relevant market transactions.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed qualitative assessments for our Aerospace, Marine Systems and Combat Systems reporting units as the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded the respective carrying values based on our most recent quantitative assessments, which were performed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our qualitative assessments did not present indicators of impairment for the reporting units.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we also completed a qualitative assessment for our Technologies reporting unit as its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25% at the time of our last quantitative assessment in the fourth quarter of 2022. Interest rates rose over the last year, but the increase was within the tolerances established in our previous quantitative analysis. Our qualitative assessment this year did not present any other indicators of impairment. However, if interest rates were to continue to increase without an offsetting increase in future cash flow projections, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would decrease and could put the reporting unit at risk of goodwill impairment.\nCommitments and Contingencies.\nWe are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the normal course of business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known.\nRetirement Plans.\nOur pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates, which are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. For a discussion of our assumptions and any changes to these assumptions, as well as the impact of these changes, which is reported as an actuarial gain or loss in the reconciliation of the change in the benefit obligation, see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The key assumption is the interest rates used to discount estimated future pension benefits. We base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality,\n52\nfixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period. The effect of a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption on the December 31, 2023, pension benefit obligation is ($317) or $332, respectively.\nAs described in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts. Therefore, the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the retirement benefit cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results.\nGUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe outstanding notes described in Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, issued by General Dynamics Corporation (the parent), are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured, joint and several basis by several of the parent’s 100%-owned subsidiaries (the guarantors). The guarantee of each guarantor ranks equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of such guarantor. A listing of the guarantors is included in an exhibit to this Form 10-K.\nBecause the parent is a holding company, its cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the outstanding notes, depends on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to distribute cash to the parent, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the outstanding notes have a direct claim only against the parent and the guarantors.\nUnder the relevant indenture, the guarantee of each guarantor is limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without rendering the guarantee voidable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Each indenture also provides that, in the event (1) of a merger, consolidation or sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor (other than a transaction with the parent or any of its subsidiaries) or (2) there occurs a transfer, sale or other disposition of the voting stock of a guarantor so that the guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the parent, then the guarantor or the entity acquiring the assets (in the event of the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under the guarantee.\nThe following summarized financial information presents the parent and guarantors (collectively, the combined obligor group) on a combined basis. The summarized financial information of the combined obligor group excludes net investment in and earnings of subsidiaries related to interests held by the combined obligor group in subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes.\nSTATEMENT OF EARNINGS INFORMATION\n53\nBALANCE SHEET INFORMATION\nThe summarized balance sheet information presented above includes the funded status of the company’s primary qualified U.S. government pension plans as the parent has the ultimate obligation for the plans."

    "text": "CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these financial statements.\n55\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these financial statements.\n56\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these financial statements.\n57\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these financial statements.\n58\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these financial statements.\n59\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)\nA.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nGeneral Dynamics is a global aerospace and defense company that offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; ship construction and repair; land combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; and technology products and services.\nThe following is a discussion of certain significant accounting policies, and further discussion is contained in the notes to these financial statements.\nBasis of Consolidation and Classification.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Dynamics Corporation and our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. We eliminate all intercompany balances and transactions in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term contracts as current, even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year.\nUse of Estimates.\nThe nature of our business requires that we make estimates and assumptions in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nResearch and Development Expenses.\nCompany-sponsored research and development (R&D) expenses, including Aerospace product-development costs, were $\n510\nin 2023, $\n480\nin 2022 and $\n415\nin 2021. R&D expenses have trended upward driven by activities primarily associated with ongoing new aircraft development efforts. R&D expenses are included in operating costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period in which they are incurred. Customer-sponsored R&D expenses are charged directly to the related contracts.\nThe Aerospace segment has cost-sharing arrangements with some of its suppliers that enhance the segment’s internal development capabilities and offset a portion of the financial cost associated with the segment’s product development efforts. These arrangements explicitly state that supplier contributions are for reimbursement of costs we incur in the development of new aircraft models and technologies, and we retain substantial rights in the products developed under these arrangements. We record amounts received from these cost-sharing arrangements as a reduction of R&D expenses. We have no obligation to refund any amounts received under the agreements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Under the typical terms of an agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are based on milestones and are recognized as received. Our policy is to defer payments in excess of the costs we have incurred.\n60\nInterest, Net.\nNet interest expense consisted of the following:\nSee Note K for information regarding our debt obligations, including interest rates.\nCash and Equivalents and Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.\nWe consider securities with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits rated A-/A3 or higher. Our investments in other securities are included in other current and noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We report our equity securities at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. We report our available-for-sale debt securities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nWe had\nno\nmaterial trading or held-to-maturity debt securities on December 31, 2023 or 2022. See Note P for additional information regarding our investments in debt and equity securities.\nAcquisitions.\nIn the last three years, we acquired a business in our Aerospace segment and a business in our Technologies segment. The operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our reported results since their respective closing dates. The purchase prices of the acquisitions have been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.\nLong-lived Assets and Goodwill.\nWe review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows.\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50%. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments in Note O. We use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. When determining the approach to be used, we consider the current facts and circumstances of each reporting unit as well as the excess of each reporting unit’s estimated fair value over its carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessments. Our qualitative approach evaluates the business environment and various events impacting the reporting unit including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, changes in the business environment and reporting unit-specific events. If, based on the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, then a quantitative assessment is not necessary. However, if a quantitative assessment is determined to be necessary, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and, if necessary, recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Our estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value is based primarily on the discounted cash flows of the underlying operations.\n61\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed qualitative assessments for our Aerospace, Marine Systems and Combat Systems reporting units as the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded the respective carrying values based on our most recent quantitative assessments, which were performed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our qualitative assessments did not present indicators of impairment for the reporting units.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we also completed a qualitative assessment for our Technologies reporting unit as its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25% at the time of our last quantitative assessment in the fourth quarter of 2022. Interest rates rose over the last year, but the increase was within the tolerances established in our previous quantitative analysis. Our qualitative assessment this year did not present any other indicators of impairment.\nFor a summary of our goodwill by reporting unit, see Note H.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The ASU adds disclosure requirements for segment expense information. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The ASU requires disclosure of disaggregated income tax information, including the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. There are other ASUs that have been issued by the FASB but are not yet effective. We expect to implement these new standards by their effective dates, and do not expect their adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nB.\nREVENUE\nPerformance Obligations.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account for revenue. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and is, therefore, not distinct. Some of our contracts have multiple performance obligations, most commonly due to the contract covering multiple phases of the product life cycle (development, production, maintenance and support). For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service.\nContract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.\nOur performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers over time accounted for\n79\n% of our revenue in 2023,\n77\n% in 2022 and\n78\n% in 2021. Substantially all of our revenue in the defense segments\n62\nis recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customers. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&A expenses.\nRevenue from goods and services transferred to customers at a point in time accounted for\n21\n% of our revenue in 2023,\n23\n% in 2022 and\n22\n% in 2021. Most of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our Aerospace segment. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft.\nOn December 31, 2023, we had $\n93.6\nbillion of remaining performance obligations, which we also refer to as total backlog. We expect to recognize approximately\n40\n% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2024, an additional\n40\n% by the end of 2026 and the balance thereafter.\nContract Estimates.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.\nContract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer.\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, award fees and incentive fees. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include award fees or incentive fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time.\nAs a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our contract-related estimates regularly. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.\n63\nThe impact of adjustments in contract estimates on our operating earnings can be reflected in either operating costs and expenses or revenue.\nThe aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our revenue, operating earnings and diluted earnings per share as follows:\nWhile no adjustment on any one contract was material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 2023, 2022 or 2021, our Marine Systems segment’s 2023 results were affected negatively by supply chain impacts to the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost growth on the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer program, offset partially by improved performance on the John Lewis-class (T-AO-205) fleet replenishment oiler program.\nWe have large, long-term contracts with the U.S. Navy for Virginia-class submarines and an international customer for tracked vehicles in which our estimates for contract revenue include variable consideration from anticipated contract modifications. For both contracts, it is reasonably possible that the actual amount of variable consideration realized could be less than our estimate, which could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations.\nRevenue by Category.\nOur portfolio of products and services consists of more than\n9,000\nactive contracts. The following series of tables presents our revenue disaggregated by several categories.\nRevenue by major products and services was as follows:\n*\nCommand, control, communications, computers, cyber, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance\n64\nRevenue by contract type was as follows:\nOur segments operate under fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Our production contracts are primarily fixed-price. Under these contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount. Contracts for research, engineering, repair and maintenance, and other services are typically cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs incurred and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. The amount for an incentive or award fee is determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials.\nEach of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages. Typically, we assume more risk with fixed-price contracts. However, these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the work for less than originally estimated. Cost-reimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk. Accordingly, the associated base fees are usually lower than fees earned on fixed-price contracts. Under time-and-materials contracts, our profit may vary if actual labor-hour rates vary significantly from the negotiated rates. Also, because these contracts may provide little or no fee for managing material costs, the content mix can impact profitability.\n65\nRevenue by customer was as follows:\nContract Balances.\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In our defense segments, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., biweekly or monthly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Generally, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets. However, we sometimes receive advances or deposits from our customers, particularly on our international contracts, before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. In our Aerospace segment, we generally receive deposits from customers upon contract execution and upon achievement of contractual milestones. These deposits are liquidated when revenue is recognized.\nChanges in the contract asset and\n66\nliability balances during the year ended December 31, 2023, were not materially impacted by any other factors.\nRevenue recognized in 2023, 2022 and 2021 that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of each year was $\n4.2\nbillion, $\n4\nbillion and $\n3.4\nbillion, respectively. This revenue represented primarily the sale of business jet aircraft.\nC.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nWe compute basic earnings per share (EPS) using net earnings for the period and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding decreased in 2023 and 2022 due to share repurchases. See Note N for further discussion of our share repurchases.\nDiluted EPS incorporates the additional shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and the release of restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs).\nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding were as follows (in thousands):\n*\nExcludes outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock that had exercise prices in excess of the average market price of our common stock during the year and, therefore, the effect of including these options would be antidilutive. These options to\ntaled\n2,961\nin 2023\n,\n1,466\nin 2022 and\n5,037\nin 2021.\nD.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome Tax Provision.\nWe calculate our provision for federal, state and foreign income taxes based on current tax law.\nThe following is a summary of our net provision for income taxes for continuing operations:\n67\nThe reported tax provision differs from the amounts paid because some income and expense items are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax purposes. This includes the impact of the requirement, effective January 1, 2022, to capitalize and amortize over five years certain research and development expenditures that were previously deductible immediately for tax purposes, which contributed to increased net income tax payments.\nState and local income taxes allocable to U.S. government contracts are included in operating costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and, therefore, are not included in the provision above.\nThe reconciliation from the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate follows:\nNet Deferred Tax Liability.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences between reported earnings and taxable income consisted of the following:\n68\nOur deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in other noncurrent assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nOur net deferred tax liability consisted of the following:\nWe believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize our deferred tax assets, subject to the valuation allowances recognized.\nOur deferred tax balance associated with our retirement benefits includes a deferred tax asset of $\n488\non December 31, 2023, and $\n637\non December 31, 2022, related to the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) to recognize the funded status of our retirement plans. For a reconciliation of the increase in funded status of our defined benefit plans in 2023, see Note S.\nOne of our deferred tax liabilities results from our participation in the Capital Construction Fund (CCF), a program established by the U.S. government and administered by the Maritime Administration that supports the acquisition, construction, reconstruction or operation of U.S. flag merchant marine vessels. The program allows us to defer federal and state income taxes on earnings derived from eligible programs as long as the proceeds are deposited in the fund and withdrawals are used for qualified activities. We had U.S. government accounts receivable pledged (and thereby deposited) to the CCF of $\n315\nand $\n299\non December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOn December 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $\n945\n, substantially all of which are associated with jurisdictions that have an indefinite carryforward period.\nTax Uncertainties.\nWe participate in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Compliance Assurance Process (CAP), a real-time audit of our consolidated federal corporate income tax return. The IRS has examined our consolidated federal income tax returns through 2022.\nFor all periods open to examination by tax authorities, we periodically assess our liabilities and contingencies based on the latest available information. Where we believe there is more than a 50% chance that our tax position will not be sustained, we record our best estimate of the resulting tax liability, including interest, in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We include any interest or penalties incurred in connection with income taxes as part of income tax expense.\nBased on all known facts and circumstances and applicable tax law, we believe the total amount of any unrecognized tax benefits on December 31, 2023, was not material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, there are\nno\ntax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will vary significantly over the next 12 months, producing, individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n69\nE.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nAccounts receivable represent amounts billed and currently due from customers. Payment is typically received from our customers either at periodic intervals (e.g., biweekly or monthly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.\nAccounts receivable consisted of the following:\nReceivables from non-U.S. government customers included amounts related to long-term production programs for the Spanish Ministry of Defence of $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion on December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A different ministry, the Spanish Ministry of Industry, has funded work on these programs in advance of costs incurred by the company. The cash advances are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in current customer advances and deposits and will be repaid to the Ministry of Industry as we collect on the outstanding receivables from the Ministry of Defence. The net amounts for these programs on December 31, 2023 and 2022, were advance payments of $\n271\nand $\n91\n, respectively. With respect to our other receivables, we expect to collect substantially all of the year-end 2023 balance during 2024.\nF.\nUNBILLED RECEIVABLES\nUnbilled receivables represent revenue recognized on long-term contracts (contract costs and estimated profits) less associated advances and progress billings. These amounts will be billed in accordance with the agreed-upon contractual terms.\nUnbilled receivables consisted of the following:\nOn December 31, 2023 and 2022, net unbilled receivables included $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n1.7\nbillion, respectively, associated with a large international tracked vehicle contract in our Combat Systems segment. The contract, signed in 2010, had been experiencing an unbilled receivables build-up since 2021. Based on ongoing discussions with the customer and continued successful program activity, the customer resumed payments on the contract in the first quarter of 2023. Other than the balance related to the tracked vehicle contract, we expect to bill substantially all of the remaining year-end 2023 net unbilled receivables balance during 2024, and the amount not expected to be billed in 2024 results primarily from the agreed-upon contractual billing terms.\nG&A costs in unbilled revenue on December 31, 2023 and 2022, were $\n483\nand $\n559\n, respectively.\n70\nG.\nINVENTORIES\nThe majority of our inventories are for business jet aircraft. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Work in process represents largely labor, material and overhead costs associated with aircraft in the manufacturing process and is based primarily on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. Substantially all of our raw materials are valued on either the average cost or the first-in, first-out method. We record pre-owned aircraft acquired in connection with the sale of new aircraft at the lower of the trade-in value or the estimated net realizable value.\nInventories consisted of the following:\nThe increase in total inventories during 2023 was due to the ramp-up in production of new Gulfstream aircraft models, including the G700 in anticipation of its certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, as well as increased production of in-service aircraft reflecting strong customer demand. Customer deposits associated with firm orders for these aircraft, which are reported in customer advances and deposits and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, have correspondingly increased.\nH.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit were as follows:\n(a)\nGoodwill in the Technologies reporting unit was net of $\n1.8\nbillion of\naccumulated impairment losses.\n(b)\nIncluded adjustments during the purchase price allocation period.\n(c)\nConsisted primarily of adjustments for foreign currency translation.\n71\nIntangible Assets.\nIntangible assets consisted of the following:\n(a)\nChanges in gross carrying amounts consisted primarily of adjustments for foreign currency translation and write-offs of fully amortized intangible assets.\n(b)\nConsisted of acquired backlog and probable follow-on work and associated customer relationships.\nWe did not recognize any impairments of our intangible assets in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nThe amortization lives (in years) of our intangible assets on December 31, 2023, were as follows:\nAmortization expense is included in operating costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $\n194\nin 2023, $\n202\nin 2022 and $\n226\nin 2021.\nWe expect to record annual amortization expense over the next five years as follows:\n72\nI.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) is carried at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation.\nNet PP&E by major asset class consisted of the following:\nWe depreciate most of our assets using the straight-line method and the remainder using accelerated methods. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over periods of up to\n50\nyears. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods of up to\n30\nyears.\nOur government customers provide certain facilities and equipment for our use that are not included above.\nJ.\nLEASES\nWe determine at its inception whether an arrangement that provides us control over the use of an asset is a lease. We recognize at lease commencement a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. We have elected not to recognize an ROU asset and lease liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less. Some of our leases include options to extend the term of the lease for up to\n29\nyears or to terminate the lease within\none year\n. When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we include the impact of the option in the lease term for purposes of determining total future lease payments. As most of our lease agreements do not explicitly state the discount rate implicit in the lease, we use our incremental borrowing rate on the commencement date to calculate the present value of future payments.\nCertain of our leases include variable payments, which may be calculated based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or similar indices at the lease commencement date. To the extent these variable payments are not considered fixed, we exclude such payments from the ROU asset and lease liability  and expense as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments, the calculation of the ROU asset also includes any deferred rent, lease pre-payments and initial direct costs of obtaining the lease, such as commissions.\nIn addition to the base rent, real estate leases typically contain provisions for common-area maintenance and other similar services, which are considered non-lease components for accounting purposes. For our real estate leases, we apply a practical expedient to include these non-lease components in calculating the ROU asset and lease liability. For all other types of leases, non-lease components are excluded from our ROU assets and lease liabilities and expensed as incurred.\nOur leases are for office space, manufacturing facilities, and machinery and equipment. Real estate represents more than\n75\n% of our lease obligations.\n73\nThe components of lease costs were as follows:\nAdditional information related to leases was as follows:\nAdditional quantitative lease information was as follows:\n74\nThe following is a reconciliation of future undiscounted cash flows to the operating and finance lease liabilities, and the related ROU assets, presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on December 31, 2023:\nOn December 31, 2022, operating and finance lease liabilities and the related ROU assets were as follows:\nLease liabilities are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in\ncurrent\nand\nnoncurrent other liabilities\n, while ROU assets are included in\nnoncurrent other assets\n.\nOn December 31, 2023, we had additional future payments on leases that had not yet commenced of $\n216\n. These leases will commence in 2024 and 2025, and have lease terms ranging from\none\nto\n9\nyears.\n75\nK.\nDEBT\nDebt consisted of the following:\nIn May and August of 2023, we repaid fixed-rate notes of $\n750\nand $\n500\n, respectively, at their respective scheduled maturities using cash on hand. Interest payments associated with our debt were $\n378\nin 2023, $\n383\nin 2022 and $\n433\nin 2021.\nThe aggregate amounts of scheduled principal maturities of our debt are as follows:\n76\nOn December 31, 2023, we had\nno\ncommercial paper outstanding, but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future. Separately, we have a $\n4\nbillion committed bank credit facility for general corporate purposes and working capital needs and to support our commercial paper issuances. This credit facility expires in March 2027. We may renew or replace this credit facility in whole or in part at or prior to its expiration date. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows us to access the debt markets.\nOur financing arrangements contain a number of customary covenants and restrictions. We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions on December 31, 2023.\nL.\nOTHER LIABILITIES\nA summary of significant other liabilities by balance sheet caption follows:\nM.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\nIn 2015, Electric Boat Corporation, a subsidiary of General Dynamics Corporation, received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding an investigation of potential False Claims Act violations relating to alleged failures of Electric Boat’s quality system with respect to allegedly non-conforming parts purchased from a supplier. In 2016, Electric Boat was made aware that it is a defendant in a lawsuit related to this matter which had been filed under seal in U.S. district court. Also in 2016, the Suspending and Debarring Official for the U.S. Department of the Navy issued a show cause letter to Electric Boat requesting that Electric Boat respond to the official’s concerns regarding Electric Boat’s oversight and management with respect to its quality assurance systems for subcontractors and suppliers. Electric Boat responded to the show cause letter and engaged in discussions with the U.S. government.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Department of Justice declined to intervene in the qui tam action, noting that its investigation continues, and the court unsealed the relator’s complaint. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the relator filed a second amended complaint. In the third quarter of 2021, the court dismissed the relator’s complaint with prejudice. The relator appealed the dismissal of the complaint to the United States Court of Appeals, which was not granted. In the third quarter of 2023, the Court of Appeals affirmed dismissal of the relator’s complaint with prejudice. The relator thereafter filed a\n77\npetition for rehearing with the Court of Appeals. Given the current status of these matters, we are unable to express a view regarding the ultimate outcome or, if the outcome is adverse, to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss. Depending on the outcome of these matters, there could be a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOn October 6, 2023, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against General Dynamics Corporation, certain of its subsidiaries and various other companies alleging that they conspired, in violation of the Sherman Act, not to solicit naval architects and marine engineers from each other. The named plaintiffs purport to represent a class of individuals consisting of all naval architects and marine engineers employed by the shipyard and consultancy defendants, their predecessors, their subsidiaries and/or their related entities in the United States at any time since January 1, 2000. The plaintiffs allege that the conspiracy suppressed compensation paid to the putative class members, and the plaintiffs seek trebled monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, injunctive and other equitable relief. We are defending the matter. However, given the current status of this matter, we are unable to express a view regarding the ultimate outcome or, if the outcome is adverse, to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss. Depending on the outcome of this matter, there could be a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAdditionally, various other claims and legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against us. These other matters relate to such issues as government investigations and claims, the protection of the environment, asbestos-related claims and employee-related matters. The nature of litigation is such that we cannot predict the outcome of these other matters. However, based on information currently available, we believe any potential liabilities in these other proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nEnvironmental\nWe are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and third-party sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency. Based on historical experience, we expect that a significant percentage of the total remediation and compliance costs associated with these facilities will continue to be allowable contract costs and, therefore, recoverable under U.S. government contracts.\nAs required, we provide financial assurance for certain sites undergoing or subject to investigation or remediation. We accrue environmental costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Where applicable, we seek insurance recovery for costs related to environmental liabilities. We do not record insurance recoveries before collection is considered probable. Based on all known facts and analyses, we do not believe that our liability at any individual site, or in the aggregate, arising from such environmental conditions will be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We also do not believe that the range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond what has been recorded would be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOther\nGovernment Contracts.\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. government audits and investigations relating to our operations, including claims for fines, penalties, and compensatory and\n78\ntreble damages. We believe the outcome of such ongoing government audits and investigations will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIn the performance of our contracts, we routinely request contract modifications that require additional funding from the customer. Most often, these requests are due to customer-directed changes in the scope of work. While we are entitled to recovery of these costs under our contracts, the administrative process with our customer may be protracted. Based on the circumstances, we periodically file requests for equitable adjustment (REAs) that are sometimes converted into claims. In some cases, these requests are disputed by our customer. We believe our outstanding modifications, REAs and other claims will be resolved without material impact to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nLetters of Credit and Guarantees.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have entered into letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other similar arrangements with financial institutions and insurance carriers\ntotaling approximately $\n1.6\nbillion on December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, from time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we contractually guarantee the payment or performance of our subsidiaries arising under certain contracts.\nAircraft Trade-ins.\nIn connection with orders for new aircraft in contract backlog, some Gulfstream customers hold options to trade in aircraft as partial consideration in their new-aircraft transaction. These trade-in commitments are generally structured to establish the fair market value of the trade-in aircraft at a date generally\n45\nor fewer days preceding delivery of the new aircraft to the customer. At that time, the customer is required to either exercise the option or allow its expiration. Other trade-in commitments are structured to guarantee a predetermined trade-in value. These commitments present more risk in the event of an adverse change in market conditions. In either case, any excess of the preestablished trade-in price above the fair market value at the time the new aircraft is delivered is treated as a reduction of revenue in the new-aircraft sales transaction.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the estimated change in fair market values from the date of the commitments was not material.\nLabor Agreements.\nOn December 31, 2023, approximately one-fifth of the employees of our subsidiaries were working under collectively bargained terms and conditions, including\n62\ncollective agreements that we have negotiated directly with unions and works councils. A number of these agreements expire within any given year. Historically, we have been successful at renegotiating these labor agreements without any material disruption of operating activities. In 2024, we expect to negotiate the terms of\n20\nagreements covering approximately\n2,100\nemployees. We do not expect the renegotiations will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nProduct Warranties.\nWe provide warranties to our customers associated with certain product sales. We record estimated warranty costs in the period in which the related products are delivered. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date is based generally on the number of months of warranty coverage remaining for the products delivered and the average historical monthly warranty payments. Warranty obligations incurred in connection with long-term production contracts are accounted for within the contract estimates at completion. Our other warranty obligations, primarily for business jet aircraft, are included in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n79\nThe changes in the carrying amount of warranty liabilities for each of the past three years were as follows:\nN.\nSHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nAuthorized Stock.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of\n500\nmillion shares of $\n1\nper share par value common stock and\n50\nmillion shares of $\n1\nper share par value preferred stock. The preferred stock is issuable in series, with the rights, preferences and limitations of each series to be determined by our board of directors (Board).\nShares Issued and Outstanding.\nOn December 31, 2023, we had\n481,880,634\nshares of common stock issued and\n273,599,948\nshares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted stock of\n441,075\nshares. On December 31, 2022, we had\n481,880,634\nshares of common stock issued and\n274,411,106\nshares of common stock outstanding.\nNo\nshares of our preferred stock were outstanding on either date. The only changes in our shares outstanding during 2023 and 2022 resulted from shares repurchased in the open market and share activity under our equity compensation plans. See Note R for additional details.\nShare Repurchases.\nOur Board, from time to time, authorizes management to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market. In 2023, we repurchased\n2\nmillion of our outstanding shares for $\n434\n. On December 31, 2023,\n4.7\nmillion shares remained authorized by our Board for repurchase, representing\n1.7\n% of our total shares outstanding. We repurchased\n5.3\nmillion shares for $\n1.2\nbillion in 2022 and\n10.3\nmillion shares for $\n1.8\nbillion in 2021.\nDividends per Share.\nOur Board declared dividends per share of $\n5.28\nin 2023\n,\n$\n5.04\nin 2022\nand\n$\n4.76\nin 2021. We paid cash dividends of $\n1.4\nbillion in 2023 and 2022, and $\n1.3\nbillion in 2021.\n80\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.\nThe changes, pretax and net of tax, in each component of AOCL consisted of the following:\nAmounts reclassified out of AOCL related primarily to changes in our retirement plans’ funded status and included pretax recognized net actuarial losses and amortization of prior service credit. See Note S for these amounts, which are included in our net annual pension and other post-retirement benefit cost (credit).\nO.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe have\nfour\noperating segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies. We organize our segments in accordance with the nature of products and services offered. We measure each segment’s profitability based on operating earnings. As a result, we do not allocate net interest, other income and expense items, and income taxes to our segments.\nSummary financial information for each of our segments follows:\n(a)\nSee Note B for additional revenue information by segment.\n(b)\nCorporate operating costs consisted primarily of equity-based compensation expense.\n81\nThe following is additional summary financial information for each of our segments:\nThe following table presents our revenue by geographic area based on the location of our customers:\nOur revenue from non-U.S. operations was $\n4.3\nbillion in 2023, $\n4\nbillion in 2022 and $\n4.4\nbillion in 2021, and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes from non-U.S. operations were $\n631\nin 2023, $\n567\nin 2022 and $\n588\nin 2021. The long-lived assets associated with these operations were\n4\n% of our total long-lived assets on December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nP.\nFAIR VALUE\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants. Various valuation approaches can be used to determine fair value, each requiring different valuation inputs. The following hierarchy classifies the inputs used to determine fair value into three levels:\n•\nLevel 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 – inputs, other than quoted prices, observable by a marketplace participant either directly or indirectly.\n•\nLevel 3 – unobservable inputs significant to the fair value measurement.\nWe did not have any significant non-financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nOur financial instruments include cash and equivalents, accounts receivable and payable, marketable securities held in trust and other investments, short- and long-term debt, and derivative financial instruments. The carrying values of cash and equivalents and accounts receivable and payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair value.\nThe following tables present the fair values of\n82\nour other financial assets and liabilities on December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the basis for determining their fair values:\nOur Level 1 assets include commingled equity and fixed-income funds that are valued using a unit price or net asset value (NAV). These funds are actively traded and valued using quoted prices for identical securities from the market exchanges. The fair value of our Level 2 assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of fixed-income securities, cash flow hedges and our fixed-rate notes, is determined under a market approach using valuation models that incorporate observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields and quoted prices for similar assets. Our Level 3 assets include direct private equity investments that are measured using inputs unobservable to a marketplace participant.\nQ.\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nWe are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and investments. We may use derivative financial instruments to hedge some of these risks as described below. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n83\nForeign Currency Risk.\nOur foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. To the extent possible, we include terms in our contracts that are designed to protect us from this risk. Otherwise, we enter into derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts, designed to offset and minimize our risk. The dollar-weighted\none-year\naverage maturity of these instruments generally matches the duration of the activities that are at risk.\nCommodity Price Risk.\nWe are subject to commodity price risk, primarily on long-term, fixed-price contracts. To the extent possible, we include terms in our contracts that are designed to protect us from these risks. Some of the protective terms included in our contracts are considered derivative financial instruments but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract. We have not entered into any material commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant. We do not believe that changes in commodity prices will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nInvestment Risk.\nOur investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to\nfive years\n. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, we held $\n1.9\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion in cash and equivalents, respectively, but held no material marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some of our obligations under workers’ compensation and non-qualified pension plans. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, we held marketable securities in trust of $\n191\nand $\n162\n, respectively. These marketable securities are reflected at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in other current and noncurrent assets. See Note P for additional details.\nHedging Activities.\nWe had notional forward exchange contracts outstanding of $\n5.7\nbillion and $\n6.9\nbillion on December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These derivative financial instruments are cash flow hedges and are reflected at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in other current assets and liabilities. See Note P for additional details.\nChanges in fair value (gains and losses) related to derivative financial instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCL until the underlying transaction is reflected in earnings. Alternatively, gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded each period in earnings. All gains and losses from derivative financial instruments recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings are presented in the same line item as the underlying transaction, generally operating costs and expenses.\nNet gains and losses recognized in earnings on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting were not material to our results of operations in any of the past three years. Net gains and losses reclassified to earnings from AOCL related to qualified hedges were also not material to our results of operations in any of the past three years, and we do not expect the amount of these gains and losses that will be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months to be material.\nWe had no material derivative financial instruments designated as fair value or net investment hedges on December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nForeign Currency Financial Statement Translation.\nWe translate foreign currency balance sheets from our international businesses’ functional currency (generally the respective local currency) to U.S. dollars at the end-of-period exchange rates, and statements of earnings at the average exchange rates for each period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are a component of AOCL.\n84\nWe do not hedge the fluctuation in reported revenue and earnings resulting from the translation of these international operations’ results into U.S. dollars. The impact of translating our non-U.S. operations’ revenue and earnings into U.S. dollars was not material to our results of operations in any of the past three years. In addition, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on non-U.S. cash balances was not material in any of the past three years.\nR.\nEQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS\nEquity Compensation Overview.\nWe have equity compensation plans for employees, as well as for non-employee members of our Board. The equity compensation plans seek to provide an effective means of attracting and retaining directors, officers and key employees, and to provide them with incentives to enhance our growth and profitability. Under the equity compensation plans, awards may be granted to officers, employees or non-employee directors in common stock, options to purchase common stock, restricted shares of common stock, participation units (including RSUs, stock appreciation rights and phantom stock units) or any combination of these.\nAnnually, we grant awards of stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to participants in our equity compensation plans in early March. Additionally, we may make limited ad hoc grants on a quarterly basis for new hires or promotions. We issue common stock under our equity compensation plans from treasury stock.\nOn December 31, 2023, in addition to the shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, approximately\n17\nmillion shares have been authorized for awards that may be granted in the future.\nEquity-based Compensation Expense.\nEquity-based compensation expense is included in G&A expenses.\nThe following table details the components of equity-based compensation expense recognized in net earnings in each of the past three years:\nStock Options.\nStock options granted under our equity compensation plans are issued with an exercise price at the fair value of our common stock determined by the average of the high and low stock prices as listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the date of grant. Participants generally vest in stock options over\nthree years\n– with\n50\n% of the options vesting after two years and the remaining\n50\n% vesting the following year – and expire\n10\nyears after the grant date.\nWe recognize compensation expense related to stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures, except for awards to retirement-eligible participants that are recognized on an accelerated basis effective with the 2022 grant. Estimated forfeitures are based on our historical forfeiture experience.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model\nwith the following assumptions for each of the past three years:\n85\nWe determine the above assumptions based on the following:\n•\nExpected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock\n•\nExpected term is based on assumptions used by a set of comparable peer companies\n•\nRisk-free interest rate is the yield on a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option at the grant date\n•\nExpected dividend yield is based on our historical dividend yield\nThe resulting weighted average fair value per stock option granted (in dollars) was $\n47.46\nin 2023, $\n38.93\nin 2022 and $\n28.87\nin 2021. Stock option expense reduced pretax operating earnings (and on a diluted per-share basis) by $\n82\n($\n0.24\n) in 2023\n,\n$\n91\n($\n0.26\n) in 2022 and $\n58\n($\n0.16\n) in 2021. On December 31, 2023, we had $\n34\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.7\nyears.\nA summary of stock option activity during 2023 follows:\nSummary information with respect to our stock options’ intrinsic value and remaining contractual term on December 31, 2023, follows:\nIn the table above, intrinsic value is calculated as the excess, if any, of the market price of our stock on the last trading day of the year over the exercise price of the options. For stock options exercised, intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $\n75\nin 2023, $\n205\nin 2022 and $\n62\nin 2021.\n86\nRestricted Stock/RSUs.\nGrants of restricted stock are awards of shares of common stock. RSUs represent obligations that have a value derived from or related to the value of our common stock, and are payable in cash or common stock. The fair value of restricted stock and RSUs equals the average of the high and low market prices of our common stock as listed on the NYSE on the date of grant.\nParticipants generally vest in restricted stock and RSUs, over a\nthree-year\nrestriction period after the grant date, during which recipients may not sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise convey their restricted shares to another party. During this period, restricted stock recipients receive cash dividends on their restricted shares and are entitled to vote those shares, while RSU recipients receive dividend-equivalent units instead of cash dividends and are not entitled to vote their RSUs or dividend-equivalent units.\nWe grant RSUs with one or more performance measures (performance stock units or PSUs) determined by the compensation committee of the Board as described in our proxy statement. Depending on the company’s performance, the number of PSUs earned may be less than, equal to or greater than the original number of PSUs awarded subject to a payout range.\nWe recognize compensation expense related to restricted stock and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards, except for restricted stock awards to retirement-eligible participants that are recognized on an accelerated basis.\nCompensation expense related to restricted stock and RSUs reduced pretax operating earnings (and on a diluted per-share basis) by $\n99\n($\n0.28\n) in 2023, $\n74\n($\n0.21\n) in 2022 and $\n68\n($\n0.19\n) in 2021. On December 31, 2023, we had $\n88\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock and RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.8\nyears.\nA summary of restricted stock and RSU activity during 2023 follows:\nThe total fair value of vesting shares was $\n96\nin 2023, $\n95\nin 2022 and $\n52\nin 2021.\nS.\nRETIREMENT PLANS\nWe provide retirement benefits to eligible employees through a variety of plans:\n•\nDefined contribution\n•\nDefined benefit\n◦\nPension (qualified and non-qualified)\n◦\nOther post-retirement benefit\nSubstantially all of our plans use a December 31 measurement date, consistent with our fiscal year.\n87\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe provide eligible employees the opportunity to participate in defined contribution plans (commonly known as 401(k) plans), which permit contributions on a before-tax and after-tax basis. Employees may contribute to various investment alternatives. In most of these plans, we match a portion of the employees’ contributions.\nOur contributions to these plans totaled $\n462\nin 2023, $\n415\nin 2022\nand\n$\n398\nin 2021. The defined-contribution plans held approximately\n16\nmillion shares of our common stock, representing approximately\n6\n% of our outstanding shares, on December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nPlan Descriptions.\nWe have trusteed, qualified pension plans covering eligible employees aligned with the markets in our business: U.S. government, non-U.S. government and commercial. Some of these plans require employees to make contributions to the plan. We also sponsor several non-qualified pension plans, which provide eligible executives with additional benefits, including excess benefits over limits imposed on qualified plans by federal tax law. The principal factors affecting the benefits earned by participants in our pension plans are employees’ years of service and compensation levels. Our primary U.S. pension plans, which comprise the majority of our unfunded obligation, were closed to new salaried participants on January 1, 2007, and were closed to new hourly participants in subsequent collective bargaining agreements over the next several years. Additionally, we have made several changes to these plans for certain participants that limit or cease the benefits that accrue for future service.\nIn addition to pension benefits, we maintain plans that provide post-retirement health care and life insurance coverage for certain employees and retirees. These benefits vary by employment status, age, service and salary level at retirement. The coverage provided and the extent to which the retirees share in the cost of the program vary throughout the company. The plans provide health care and life insurance benefits only to those employees who retire directly from our service and not to those who terminate service prior to eligibility for retirement.\nContributions.\nIt is our policy to fund our qualified pension plans in a manner that optimizes the tax deductibility and contract recovery of contributions considered within our capital deployment framework. Therefore, we may make discretionary contributions in addition to the required contributions determined in accordance with IRS regulations.\nWe contributed $\n106\nto our qualified pension plans in 2023. In 2024, our required contributions are $\n73\n.\nWe maintain several tax-advantaged accounts, primarily Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts, to fund the obligations for some of our other post-retirement benefit plans. For non-funded plans, claims are paid as received.\nContributions to our other post-retirement benefit plans were not material in 2023 and are not expected to be material in 2024.\n88\nBenefit Payments.\nWe expect the following benefits to be paid from our defined benefit plans over the next 10 years:\nBenefit Cost.\nOur annual benefit cost consists of five primary elements:\n•\nThe cost of benefits earned by employees for services rendered during the year\n•\nAn interest charge on our plan liabilities\n•\nAn expected return on our plan assets for the year\n•\nActuarial gains and losses, which result from changes in assumptions and differences between actual and expected return on assets and participant experience\n•\nThe cost or credit attributed to prior service resulting from changes we make to plan benefit terms\nFor qualified pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits are initially deferred in AOCL and then amortized on a straight-line basis over future years. For our qualified U.S. government pension plans, we amortize actuarial gains and losses over a custom amortization period based on the amount of pension costs allocable to our U.S. government contracts. For the remaining qualified pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, we amortize only the amount of actuarial gains and losses that exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations. This amount is amortized over the average remaining service period of plan participants who are active employees unless all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive or are not accruing additional benefits. In such cases, the amortization period is based on the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. To further reduce the volatility of our annual benefit cost, gains and losses resulting from the return on plan assets are included over\nfive years\nin the determination of the amortizable amount of actuarial gains and losses. For non-qualified pension plans, we recognize actuarial gains and losses immediately.\n89\nNet annual benefit cost (credit) consisted of the following:\nOur contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of pension and other post-retirement benefit costs related to employees working on government contracts. The amount allocated to U.S. government contracts is determined in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which may result in a timing difference with the amount determined under GAAP. We defer this difference on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, cumulative benefit costs exceed the amount allocated to contracts, and the difference is reported in other current assets. To the extent there is a non-service component of net annual benefit cost (credit) for our defined benefit plans, it is reported in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nFunded Status.\nWe recognize an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet equal to the funded status of each of our defined benefit plans. The funded status is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and its benefit obligation.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the benefit obligations and plan/trust assets, and the resulting funded status, of our defined benefit plans:\n90\nThe overall increase in our pension benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2023, was due primarily to actuarial loss created by the change in the weighted-average discount rate, which decreased from\n5.08\n% at December 31, 2022, to\n4.83\n% at December 31, 2023.\nThe overall decrease in our pension benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2022, was due primarily to actuarial gains created by the change in the weighted-average discount rate, which increased from\n2.84\n% at December 31, 2021, to\n5.08\n% at December 31, 2022.\nAmounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the following:\nAmounts deferred in AOCL for our defined benefit plans consisted of the following:\n91\nThe following is a reconciliation of the change in AOCL for our defined benefit plans:\nA pension plan’s funded status is the difference between the plan’s assets and its projected benefit obligation (PBO). The PBO is the present value of future benefits attributed to employee services rendered to date, including assumptions about future compensation levels.\nOn December 31, 2023 and 2022, most of our pension plans had a PBO that exceeded the plans’ assets. Summary information for those plans follows:\nA pension plan’s accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the present value of future benefits attributed to employee services rendered to date, excluding assumptions about future compensation levels. The ABO for all pension plans was $\n13.6\nbillion and $\n13.4\nbillion on December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The ABO for all other post-retirement plans was $\n598\nand $\n616\non December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOn December 31, 2023 and 2022, most of our defined benefit plans had an ABO that exceeded the plans’ assets. Summary information for those plans follows:\nAssumptions.\nWe calculate the plan assets and liabilities for a given year and the net annual benefit cost for the subsequent year using assumptions determined as of December 31 of the year in question.\n92\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used to determine our benefit obligations:\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used to determine our net annual benefit cost:\nWe base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period.\nWe determine the long-term rates of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation. In 2023, we decreased the expected long-term rates of return on assets by\n44\nbasis points for our pension plans and by\n8\nbasis points for our other post-retirement benefit plans, resulting from changes in our asset allocations.\n93\nRetirement plan assumptions are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. Given the long-term nature of the assumptions being made, actual outcomes can and often do differ from these estimates. Changes in these estimates impact future pension and other post-retirement benefit costs. As previously discussed, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of pension and other post-retirement benefit costs. Therefore, the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results.\nAssets.\nA committee of our Board is responsible for the strategic oversight of our defined benefit plan assets held in trust. Management develops investment policies and provides oversight of a third-party investment manager who reports to the committee on a regular basis. The outsourced third-party investment manager develops investment strategies and makes all day-to-day investment decisions related to defined benefit plan assets in accordance with our investment policy and target allocation percentages with the objective of generating future returns at or above our assumed long-term rates of return used to determine net annual benefit cost.\nOur investment policy endeavors to strike the appropriate balance between asset growth and funded status protection. The objective of the policy is to generate asset returns that will increase the funded status of our plans while systematically reducing cost and deficit risk as funded status of the plans improve. Several of our U.S. pension plans are now utilizing a target asset allocation strategy that will automatically increase investments in liability-hedging assets (primarily commingled fixed-income funds) and decrease investments in return-seeking assets (primarily commingled equity funds) as the plans reach specific funded status targets. At the end of 2023, our target asset allocation ranges for plans that are less than fully funded were\n40\n-\n70\n% return-seeking assets and\n30\n-\n60\n% liability-hedging assets.\nMore than\n90\n% of our pension plan assets are held in a single trust for our primary qualified U.S. government and commercial pension plans. On December 31, 2023, the trust was invested largely in commingled funds comprised primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. The trust also invests in other asset classes consistent with our investment policy. Our investment policy allows the use of derivative instruments when appropriate to reduce anticipated asset volatility, to gain exposure to an asset class or to adjust the duration of fixed-income assets.\nWe hold assets in VEBA trusts for some of our other post-retirement benefit plans. On December 31, 2023, these trusts were invested largely in fixed-income securities and commingled funds comprised primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. Our asset allocation strategy for the VEBA trusts considers funded status, potential fluctuations in our other post-retirement benefit obligation, the taxable nature of certain VEBA trusts, tax deduction limits on contributions and the regulatory environment.\n94\nOur defined benefit plan assets are reported at fair value. See Note P for a discussion of the hierarchy for determining fair value. Our Level 1 assets include commingled equity and fixed-income funds that are valued using a unit price or NAV. These funds are actively traded and valued using quoted prices for identical securities from the market exchanges. Our Level 2 assets include fixed-income securities and commingled equity and fixed-income funds whose underlying investments are valued using observable marketplace inputs. The fair value of plan assets invested in fixed-income securities is generally determined under a market approach using valuation models that incorporate observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields and quoted prices for similar assets. Our plan assets invested in Level 2 commingled funds are valued using a unit price or NAV obtained from the fund’s transfer agent or investment manager that is based on the underlying, observable investments of the fund. Our Level 3 assets consist of insurance deposit contracts, retirement annuity contracts and real estate funds.\nCertain investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy but are included in the tables below to permit reconciliation to total plan assets. These investments are redeemable at NAV generally on a monthly or quarterly basis, and most have redemption notice periods of up to\n90\ndays.\nThe unfunded commitments related to these investments were not material on December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nThe fair value of our pension plan assets by investment category and the corresponding level within the fair value hierarchy were as follows:\n95\n96\nThe fair value of our other post-retirement benefit plan assets by category and the corresponding level within the fair value hierarchy were as follows:\n(a)\nWe had no Level 3 investments on December 31, 2023.\n(a)\nWe had no Level 3 investments on December 31, 2022.\n97\nChanges in our Level 3 defined benefit plan assets during 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n98\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of General Dynamics Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Shareholders’ Equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 8, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n99\nEstimates used to recognize revenue for select long-term contracts\nAs discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, accounting for long-term contracts involves estimating total contract revenue and costs. Revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations.\nFor a select group of long-term contracts in the defense segments, we identified the assessment of certain assumptions that are an input into the amount of revenue recognized during the period as a critical audit matter. Examples of these assumptions are estimates of labor hours, the cost of materials for the work to be performed and the transaction price. The evaluation of one or more of the assumptions used to recognize revenue for the select group of long-term contracts required a high level of subjective auditor judgment due to the nature of the individual contracts and related contract performance risks. Specifically, changes to certain assumptions may have a significant impact on the revenue recorded during the period.\nThe following are primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the assumptions used to recognize revenue for the select group of long-term contracts. This included contract-level controls over certain revenue and cost assumptions. For certain contracts, we compared the Company’s historical estimates of costs to actual costs incurred to assess the Company’s ability to estimate accurately. Based on the nature of the individual contract, we evaluated certain revenue and cost assumptions by:\n–\nreading the underlying contract and any related amendments to obtain an understanding of the contractual requirements and related performance obligations\n–\nassessing the enforceable rights and obligations of the underlying contractual terms when changes to price or scope, or both, are not yet agreed\n–\nassessing costs incurred to date and the relative progress toward satisfying the performance obligation(s) of the contract\n–\nassessing, if relevant, the estimated costs at completion by considering similar or predecessor contracts and programs\n–\ninquiring of financial and operational personnel of the Company to identify factors that should be considered within the estimated costs at completion or indications of potential management bias\n–\ninspecting correspondence, if any, between the Company and the customer regarding actual to date and expected performance\n–\nanalyzing the sufficiency of the Company’s assessment of contract performance risks included within the estimated costs at completion.\nDiscount rates used in pension benefit obligation\nAs discussed in Note S to the consolidated financial statements,\nt\nhe Company’s pension benefit obligation and the associated plan assets were $13.7 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively, on December 31, 2023. The weighted-average discount rate assumption used in estimating the pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023, of 4.83% was based on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities consistent\n100\nwith the projected benefit payout period. The selected discount rates have a significant effect on the measurement of the pension benefit obligation.\nWe identified the evaluation of the discount rates for certain plans’ pension benefit obligations to be a critical audit matter, due to the extent of specialized skills required to assess the discount rate assumption used to discount estimated future benefit payments. In addition, certain plans’ pension benefit obligations were sensitive to changes in this assumption.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the pension benefit obligation process. This included a control related to the determination of the discount rate assumption. We involved an actuarial professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n–\nevaluating the Company’s methodology used to develop the discount rates\n–\nchecking the accuracy of the discount rates using the cash flows and spot rates provided by the Company\n–\nevaluating the Company’s determination of the discount rates by comparing changes in the discount rates from the prior year against changes in published indices using publicly available market data.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nMcLean, Virginia\nFebruary 8, 2024\n101"

Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, on December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nThe certifications of the company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this report.\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nTo the Shareholders of General Dynamics Corporation:\nThe management of General Dynamics Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023\n. In making this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n. Based on our evaluation we believe that, as of\nDecember 31, 2023\n, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nKPMG LLP has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The KPMG report immediately follows this report.\n102\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited General Dynamics Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Shareholders’ Equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 8, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only\n103\nin accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."
