    "text": "Emerson (“the Company”) is a global technology and software company that provides innovative solutions for customers in a wide range of end markets around the world. Through its leading automation portfolio, Emerson helps process, hybrid and discrete manufacturers optimize operations, protect personnel, reduce emissions and achieve their sustainability goals. Sales by geographic destination in 2024 were: the Americas,\n50 percent\n; Asia, Middle East & Africa,\n30 percent\n(China,\n11 percent\n); and Europe,\n20 percent\n.\nPortfolio management is an integral component of Emerson's growth and value creation strategy. Over the past three years, the Company has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and divestitures of non-core businesses. These actions were undertaken to create a cohesive, higher growth and higher margin industrial technology portfolio as a global automation leader serving a diversified set of end markets. The Company’s recent portfolio actions include the following transactions (note that all d\nollars in Item 1 are in millions, except where noted)\n:\n•\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of National Instruments Corporation (\"NI\") at an equity value of $8.2 billion. NI, which provides software-connected automated test and measurement systems that enable enterprises to bring products to market faster and at a lower cost, had revenues of approximately $1.7 billion and pretax earnings of approximately\n$170\nfor the 12 months ended September 30, 2023.\n•\nOn May 31, 2023, the Company completed the sale of a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the former Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in 2022; the new standalone business is named Copeland) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone in a $14.0 billion transaction. Emerson received upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.7 billion and a note receivable with a face value of $2.25 billion, while retaining a 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. Subsequently, in August 2024, Emerson sold its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to private equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and sold the note receivable to Copeland for $1.9 billion.\n•\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion.\n•\nOn May 31, 2022 the Company completed the divestiture of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC.\n•\nOn May 16, 2022, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"Heritage AspenTech\") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectively, the “Emerson Industrial Software Business”), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (defined as \"AspenTech\" herein). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech had 2023 net sales of $1.04 billion.\n•\nOn November 5, 2024, the Company announced a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of AspenTech not already owned by Emerson for $240 per share in cash, which implies a fully diluted market capitalization for AspenTech of $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $15.1 billion. The Company currently owns approximately 57 percent of AspenTech's outstanding shares of common stock. The proposal is not subject to any financing condition and would be financed from cash on hand, committed lines of credit and/or other available sources of financing. Also on November 5, 2024, the Company announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives, including a cash sale, for its Safety & Productivity segment. No assurance can be given whether the proposal or the review will lead to one or more transactions or as to any of the terms or conditions of such transactions. See Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for additional information.\n1\nFurther information regarding acquisition and divestiture activity is set forth in Notes 4 and 5.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This includes the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, and have now been reclassified and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 5). Beginning in 2024, the Company reports NI (which is now referred to as Test & Measurement) as a new segment in the Software and Control business group. As a result of its portfolio transformation discussed above, the Company now reports seven segments and two business groups, which are highlighted in the table below (see Note 20 for further details).\nThe Company's comprehensive automation portfolio includes intelligent devices, control systems and design and optimization software solutions to support a diverse set of industries and infrastructure, including process industries (such as chemical, power & renewables and energy), hybrid industries (life sciences, metals & mining, food & beverage, pulp & paper, and others), discrete industries (including automotive, medical, packaging and semiconductor) and more.\nEmerson was incorporated in Missouri in 1890 and has evolved through internal growth and strategic acquisitions. Management has a well-established set of operating mechanisms to manage its business performance and set strategy. The Company also has processes undertaken by management with oversight from the Board of Directors to specifically focus on risks in areas such as cybersecurity, compliance, legal, sustainability, financial and reputational, among others. The Company periodically updates, assesses, and monitors its risk exposures, provides timely updates to the Board, and takes actions to mitigate these risks.\nAll Note references in this document refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which notes are hereby incorporated by reference.

Control Systems & Software solutions are predominantly used by process and hybrid manufacturers. Products within our Control Systems & Software segment are marketed under a variety of brands including: AMS, DeltaV and Ovation.\nTest & Measurement\nAs discussed above, Emerson completed the acquisition of NI on October 11, 2023. This business is now referred to as Test & Measurement and is reported as a new segment in the Software and Control business group in 2024. Test & Measurement provides software-connected automated test and measurement systems that enable enterprises to bring products to market faster and at a lower cost. The Test & Measurement business spans the full range of customer needs including modular instrumentation, data acquisition and control solutions, and general-purpose development software.\nAspenTech\nAspenTech is a global leader in asset optimization software that enables industrial manufacturers to design, operate and maintain their operations for maximum performance. AspenTech combines decades of modeling, simulation and optimization capabilities with industrial operations expertise and applies advanced analytics to improve the profitability and sustainability of production assets. The purpose-built software drives value for customers by improving operational efficiency and maximizing productivity, reducing unplanned downtime and safety risks, and minimizing energy consumption and emissions.\nRESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT\nInvesting in innovation to accelerate organic growth is a critical component of Emerson's value creation strategy. The Company is focused on key growth initiatives across its software, control and intelligent devices portfolio. These initiatives include disruptive measurement technologies, software-defined automation systems, self-optimizing asset software and sustainability solutions. Total spending for R&D, engineering expense and customer-funded engineering and development was 8.1 percent of sales in 2024 compared to 6.9 percent in 2023 and 6.3 percent in 2022.\n3\nDISTRIBUTION\nThe principal worldwide distribution channel for a majority of the Company's product offerings is through a direct sales forc\ne, while a network of independent sales representatives, and to a lesser extent independent distributors purchasing products for resale, are also utilized.\nRAW MATERIALS\nThe Company's major requirements for basic raw materials include steel, cast iron, electronics, rare earth metals, aluminum a\nnd brass; and to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. The Company seeks to have many sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events. Despite market price volatility for certain requirements, the raw materials and various purchased components needed for the Company’s products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. See Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nPATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES\nThe Company maintains an intellectual property portfolio it has developed or acquired over a number of years, including patents, trademarks and licenses. The Company also continues to develop or acquire new intellectual propert\ny. New patent applications are continuously filed to protect the Company’s ongoing research and development activities and the Company periodically reviews the continued utility of patent assets. The Company’s trademark registrations may be renewed and their duration is dependent upon national laws and trademark use. While this proprietary intellectual property portfolio is important to the Company in the aggregate, management does not regard any of its segments as being dependent on any single patent, trademark registration or license.\nBACKLOG\nThe Company’s estimated consolidated order backlog was $8.4 billion and $7.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which approximately $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion related to AspenTech, while approximately $400 was attributable to Test & Measurement. Approximately 75 percent of the Company’s consolidated backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, with the remainder substantially over the subsequent two years thereafter. Backlog by business group at September 30, 2024 and 2023 follows (dollars in millions):\nCOMPETITION\nThe Company's businesses operate in highly competitive markets. The Company competes based on product performance, quality, branding, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. A significant element of the Company's competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost. Although no single company competes directly with Emerson in all of the Company's product lines, various companies compete in one or more product lines with the number of competitors varying by product line. Some competitors have substantially greater sales, assets and financial resources than Emerson and the Company also competes with many smaller companies. Management believes Emerson has a market leadership position in many of its product lines.\nREGULATIONS\nThe Company's operations, products and services are subject to various government regulations, including environmental regulations. Our manufacturing locations generate waste, of which treatment, storage, transportation and disposal are subject to U.S. federal, state, foreign and/or local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. The Company continually works to minimize the environmental impact of its operations through safe\n4\ntechnologies, facility design and operating procedures. Compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures (including expenditures for environmental control facilities), earnings or competitive position. However, laws and regulations may be changed, accelerated or adopted that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company and which could negatively impact our operating results. See Item 1A - \"Risk Factors.\"\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nEmerson is dedicated to modernizing our workplace culture to meet the needs and expectations of today's workers and attract talent that will help us thrive. In 2022, Emerson introduced\nLet's Go\n, the Company's first-ever employee value proposition (EVP), inviting our global workforce and potential hires to join in making the world healthier, safer, smarter and more sustainable. Building on this momentum, Emerson in 2024 focused on activating its EVP among employees by further defining it across five key cultural areas: Legacy of Innovation; Challenging, Purposeful Work; Diverse People, Working Together; Limitless Growth; and Global and Local Impact. Collectively, these five areas form Emerson's differentiated employee experience. By substantiating progress and achievements in each of these areas, the Company is strengthening its culture and enabling its EVP to be considered at every touchpoint of the employee lifecycle and experience - from HR programs to the actions of leaders, behavioral norms and physical work environment.\nThe skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit Emerson's operations and performance. The Company's Board of Directors and management oversee various employee initiatives. Emerson supports and develops its employees through global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees' leadership and professional skills. Leadership development programs include intensive learning programs for new leaders as well as more established leaders. The Company also partners with educational institutions and nonprofit organizations to help prepare current and future workers with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.\nTo assess and improve employee retention and engagement, Emerson implemented a globally consistent, digital continuous listening strategy in 2023 through which all employees across the Company are surveyed annually and their feedback is used to drive actions that address areas of employee interest and concern. In 2024, 89 percent of employees participated (up from 85 percent in 2023) and Emerson's overall engagement score increased to 79 percent (up from 78 percent). In addition, Emerson's inclusion index score increased by 3.5 percentage points to 79 percent.\nEmployee health and safety in the workplace is also one of the Company’s core values. The Corporate Safety Council is led by our Chief Sustainability Officer and oversees our safety efforts, supported by health and safety committees and leaders that operate at the local site level. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. In 2024, the Company's total recordable rate of injuries was 0.30, and its lost or restricted workday case rate was 0.22 (both measured as the number of incidents per 100 employees).\nWe have identified other human capital priorities, including, among other things, providing competitive wages and benefits and promoting an inclusive culture. The Company is committed to efforts to build diverse teams and foster a work environment that supports our large global workforce and helps us innovate for our customers. Overall, women represent 33 percent of our global workforce and 24 percent of leadership positions are held by women. In the U.S., minorities represent 36 percent of our workforce and 23 percent of our leadership positions. Our global Employee Resource Groups support our diverse workforce and have grown to over 13,000 members. We are proud to have been named to Fortune Magazine's \"America's Most Innovative Companies\" list for 2023 and as a \"Best Employer for Diversity\" by Forbes in 2022.\nEmployee levels are managed to align with the pace of busin\ness and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. The Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 73,000 employees at September 30, 2024. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable.\nA small portion of the Company’s U.S. employees are unionized, while outside the U.S., we have employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.\n5\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\nEmerson’s global purpose is to drive innovation that makes the world healthier, safer, smarter and more sustainable. Our environmental sustainability strategy is focused on driving progress within our facilities and helping our customers achieve their ESG objectives. In 2021, we appointed Mike Train as Chief Sustainability Officer. This role, part of our Office of the Chief Executive, reflects our focus on sustainability across our company. Under his leadership, Emerson has made significant strides, and we are strengthening our leadership position as our customers and suppliers work to deliver their environmental targets.\nIn 2022, we set an ambitious target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our value chain by 2045 compared to a 2021 baseline. To set us on the right pathway, we will target net zero operations and a 25 percent reduction of our value chain emissions by 2030, also compared to a 2021 baseline. In 2023, we established a goal to achieve zero waste to landfill in our manufacturing facilities by 2032, from a 2022 fiscal year baseline, wherever this is compatible with local conditions and regulations. We also introduced a new Technology and Environmental Sustainability Board committee, which is tasked with overseeing strategy related to technology and R&D, the Company’s product cybersecurity practices and Emerson’s environmental sustainability goals and programs.\nOur environmental sustainability strategy is summarized by our “Greening Of, Greening By, Greening With” framework.\nGreening Of Emerson\ndemonstrates our efforts to improve our internal environmental sustainability performance, including reducing our GHG emissions and energy and water consumption as well as engaging suppliers and other value chain partners.\nGreening By Emerson\nis our approach to delivering hardware and software technology, solutions and expertise that support and enable our customers’ decarbonization and environmental sustainability efforts.\nGreening With Emerson\nreflects how we foster collaboration among stakeholders by participating in environmental sustainability industry forums, partnering to develop innovative solutions, and engaging with governments globally to support sustainability-related policies and regulations.\nEmerson’s environmental sustainability initiatives and strategy are discussed further in our 2023 Sustainability Report, which can be found on our website at www.Emerson.com; this report is not incorporated by reference and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K.\nINTERNET ACCESS\nEmerson's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and all amendments to those reports, as well as proxy statements, are available without charge through the Company’s website on the internet as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They may be accessed as follows: www.Emerson.com, Investors, SEC Filings. Information on the Company’s website does not constitute part of this Form 10-K.\nThe information set forth under Item 1A - “Risk Factors” is hereby incorporated by reference."

    "text": "Investing in our securities involves risks. You should carefully consider, among other matters, the factors set forth below and the other information in this report. The Company’s risk factors set forth below are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial also may materially, adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results. We may amend or supplement the risk factors set forth below from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe Operate in Businesses That Are Subject to Competitive Pressures That Could Affect Prices or Demand for Our Products\nOur businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile, and we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. Our businesses are\n6\nlargely dependent on the current and future business environment, including capital and consumer spending. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost. Various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line. Some of our competitors have substantially greater sales, assets and financial resources than our Company and we also compete with many smaller companies. Competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products, impacting our sales or profit margins, and/or resulting in a loss of market share. In addition, certain of our businesses rely, in part, on independent sales representatives and distributors. Any disruption or adverse change in our relationships with these independent sales representatives could weaken our competitive position and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  A disruption or adverse change could result from the sale or financial instability of an independent sales representative or distributor, changes to our relationship including favoring competing products for any reason, or other events.\nOur Operating Results Depend in Part on Continued\nSuccessful Research, Development and Marketing of New and/or Improved Products and Services, and There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Successfully Introduce New Products and Services\nThe success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change, such as, among others, artificial intelligences and machine learning, and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of bein\ng first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market.\nWe must anticipate and respond to market and technological changes driven by broader trends such as decarbonization and electrification efforts in response to climate change. Market growth from the use of cleaner energy sources, as well as emissions management, energy efficiency and decarbonization efforts are likely to depend in part on technologies not yet deployed or widely adopted today. We may not adequately innovate or position our businesses for the adoption of technologies such as battery storage solutions, hydrogen use cases in industry, mobility, and power generation, enhanced electrical grid demand management, carbon capture and sequestration or advanced nuclear power.\nThese trends and the relative competitiveness of our product and service offerings will continue to be impacted by uncertain factors such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies such as carbon taxes, greenhouse gas emission reductions, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy, or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects.\nIf We Are Unable to Defend or Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights, the Company's Competitive Position Could Be Adversely Affected\nThe Company's intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other confidential information. This intellectual property may be subject to challenge, infringement, invalidation or circumvention by third parties. Despite extensive security measures, our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems, employee theft, or other acts of industrial espionage. Should the Company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property, it may suffer competitive harm.\nWe Engage in Acquisitions and Divestitures, Which Are Subject to Domestic and Foreign Regulatory Requirements, and May Encounter Difficulties in Integrating and Separating These Businesses and Therefore We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits\nWe regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures. These activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions, and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In 2024 and in past years, we have made various acquisitions and divestitures, including our acquisition of National Instruments, our divestiture of the Climate Technologies business (now renamed Copeland), and our majority stake in Aspen\n7\nTechnology, Inc., and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business, and may continue to do so in the future. As a result of these transactions, the Company has a narrower business which is focused on higher growth markets including software, innovation and disruptive technologies, and may encounter more volatility and be more vulnerable to changing market conditions. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to achieve higher rates of growth, integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of anticipated benefits including, among others, increasing rates of profitability and growth. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur Portfolio Actions Including the Proposed Acquisition of the Remaining Interest in AspenTech Not Already Owned by the Company and the Process to Explore Strategic Alternatives for the Company's Safety & Productivity Segment May Not Be Completed or Completed on the Terms and Conditions Contemplated, or With the Expected Benefits\nOn November 5, 2024, the Company announced a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of AspenTech not already owned by Emerson for $240 per share in cash, which implies a fully diluted market capitalization for AspenTech of $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $15.1 billion, and would be financed from cash on hand, committed lines of credit and/or other available sources of financing. Also on November 5, 2024, the Company announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives, including a cash sale, for its Safety & Productivity segment. No assurance can be given whether the proposal or the review will lead to one or more transactions. We can make no assurance as to the completion, terms, timing, costs or benefits anticipated from any such transactions. Unforeseen developments, including delays in obtaining various tax, regulatory and other approvals, could delay any such transactions, or cause one or more of them to occur on terms and conditions that are less favorable, or at a higher cost, than expected.\nWe Use a Variety of Raw Materials and Components in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our P\nroducts\nOur major requirements for raw materials include steel, cast iron, electronics, rare earth metals, aluminum, brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. The Company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters, a health epidemic or pandemic, or other events. Significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur Operations Depend on Production Facilities Throughout the World, a Majority of Which Are Located Outside the United States and Subject to Increased Risks of Disrupted Production, Causing Delays in Shipments and Loss of Customers and Revenue\nWe manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority of which are located outside the United States, and also source certain materials globally. Emerging market sales represent over one-third of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we p\nlace more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a best-cost position. Our and our suppliers’ non-U.S. production facilities and operations could be disrupted by weather and natural disaster (including the potential effects of climate change), labor strife, war (including the Russia-Ukraine and other global conflicts), political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns such as an epidemic or pandemic, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equip\nped to handle such occurrences.\nOur manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws, policies and regulations in host countries, as well as economic and political upheaval, than our domestic facilities. These facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us.\n8\nAccess to Funding Through the Capital Markets is Essential to the Execution of Our Business Plan, and if We Are Unable to Maintain Such Access We Could Experience a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Financial Results\nOur ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. Volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments, or affect the Company’s ability to access those markets. If we are unable to continue to access the capital markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if our customers, suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the Company, our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur Business Success Depends on the Ability to Attract, Develop and Retain Key Personnel\nOur success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. The failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to succeed in our human capital goals and priorities as well as negatively impact our business and operating results.\nSecurity and/or Data Privacy Breaches, or Disruptions of Our Information Technology Systems Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nThe Company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. These technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; telecommunications or system failures; terrorist attacks; natural disasters; employee error or malfeasance; server or cloud provider breaches; and computer viruses or cyberattacks. Cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology networks and systems to more sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers. Despite the implementation of cybersecurity measures (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring, and maintenance of backup and protective systems), the Company’s information technology systems may still be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other electronic security breaches. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended\nperiod. In addition, it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee information. We anticipate that the risk of cybersecurity attacks will increase as artificial intelligence capabilities improve and are increasingly used to identify vulnerabilities and construct increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, with the possibility of additional vulnerabilities being introduced through our own use of artificial intelligence and its use by our stakeholders, including vendors and customers, among others. Should the Company be unable to prevent security breaches or other damage to our information technology systems, disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations, as well as expose the Company to litigation, liability or penalties under privacy laws, increased cybersecurity protection costs, reputational damage and product failure. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S. and elsewhere. Compliance with privacy and localization laws and regulations increases operational complexity. Failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to fines and penalties, as well as legal and reputational risks, including proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others.\nOur Products and Services are Highly Sophisticated and Specialized, and a Major Product Failure or Similar Event Caused by Defects, Cybersecurity Incidents or Other Failures Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Reputation, Financial Position and Results of Operations\nWe produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services that incorporate or use complex or leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Many of our products and services, including measurement and analytical instrumentation, industrial valves and equipment, and process control systems, are integrated and used in complex process, hybrid and discrete manufacturing environments. As a result, the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant. While we have built operational processes to ensure that our product design, manufacture, performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process or product\n9\nfailures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cybersecurity incidents or other intentional acts, that could result in potential product, safety, regulatory or environmental risks. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to third-party claims resulting from damages caused by our product failures, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nIndustry and General Economic Risks\nOur Substantial Sales Both in the U.S. and Abroad Subject Us to Economic Risk as Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Government Regulations and Policies and Currency Fluctuations\nWe sell, manufacture, engineer and purchase products globally, with significant sales in both mature and emerging markets. We expect sales in non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales. Our U.S. and international operations subject the Company to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world, including those related to trade, investments, taxation, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. Changes in laws or policies (including their interpretations) governing the terms of foreign trade, trade restrictions or barriers, tariffs or taxes, trade protection measures, and retaliatory countermeasures, including on imports from countries where we manufacture products, could adversely impact our business and financial results. In addition, changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.\nRecessions, Adverse Market Conditions or Downturns in End Markets We Serve May Negatively Affect Our Operations\nIn th\ne past, our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions or consumer preferences, recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve. In the future, similar changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results (including potential impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets) and cash flows. Moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations, centralization of certain business support activities, and other cost reduction initiatives, and incur higher costs. As these plans and actions can be complex, the anticipated operational improvements, efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in Tax Rates, Laws or Regulations and the Resolution of Tax Disputes Could Adversely Impact Our Financial Results\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine ou\nr consolidated income tax provision and related liabilities. The Company’s effective tax rate, cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, as well as by changes in the local tax laws and regulations, or the interpretations thereof, including multiple, overlapping tax regimes enacted as part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development proposals that implement a global minimum tax. In addition, the Company’s tax returns are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities. While we believe our tax provisions are appropriate, the final outcome of tax audits or disputes could result in adju\nstments to the Company’s tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur Reputation, Ability To Do Business and Results of Operations Could Be Impaired By Improper Conduct By Any of Our Employees, Agents or Business Partners\nWe are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including laws related to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export and import compliance, anti-trust and money\n10\nlaundering, due to our global operations. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree. We cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees, agents and business partners. Any such violation of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our business and results of operations.\nWe Are Subject to Litigation and Environmental Regulations That Could Adversely Impact Our Operating Results\nWe are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving intellectual property, commercial transactions, government contracts, the integration of emerging technologies (for example, artificial intelligence and machine learning, among others), M&A, employment, employee benefit plans, antitrust, anti-corruption, accounting, import and export, health and safety matters, product liability (including asbestos) and environmental matters, several of which claim, or may in the future claim, si\ngnificant damages. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws. In addition, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, federal, and/or state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could result in more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. While the Company has adopted certain voluntary targets, environmental laws, regulations or standards may be changed, accelerated or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company, its products or customers, which could negatively impact the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nIncreasing Interest and Expectations with Respect to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Matters by Our Various Stakeholders Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Operating Results\nIn response to growing customer, investor, employee, governmental, and other stakeholder interest in our ESG practices, we have increased reporting of our ESG programs and performance and have established and announced our aspirational purpose, causes, values, and related commitments, goals or targets, including those regarding sustainability, greenhouse gas emissions, our net zero ambition, and diversity, equity and inclusion. Our ability to achieve such goals and aspirations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which rely on the collective efforts of others or may be outside of our control.  Such risks include, among others, the availability and adoption of new or additional technologies that reduce carbon or eliminate energy sources on a commercially reasonable basis, competing and evolving economic, policy and regulatory factors, the ability of suppliers and others to meet our sustainability, diversity and other goals, the availability of qualified candidates in our labor markets and our ability to recruit and retain diverse talent, and customer engagement in our goals. There may be times where actual outcomes vary from those aimed for or expected and sometimes challenges may delay or block progress.  As a result, we cannot offer assurances that the results reflected or implied by any such statements will be realized or achieved. Moreover, standards and expectations for ESG matters continue to evolve and may be subject to varying interpretations, which may result in significant revisions to our goals or progress.  In addition, certain of our product offerings may become less attractive as standards evolve.  A failure or perceived failure to meet our aspirational purpose, causes, values, and related commitments, goals or targets within the timelines we announce, or at all, or a failure or perceived failure to meet evolving stakeholders expectations and standards, could damage our reputation, adversely affect employee retention or engagement or support from our various stakeholders and could subject us to government enforcement actions or penalties and private litigation. Such outcomes could negatively impact the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position."

    "text": "16\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains various forward-looking statements and includes assumptions concerning Emerson's operations, future results and prospects. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - “Risk Factors,” which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For exa\nmple, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, ch\nanges in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management’s control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the Company’s financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may\ndiffer from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\nUnderlying sales, which exclude the impact of significant acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure:\nnet sales\n).\nOperating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense, net, related party interest income, and income taxes) and total segment EBIT, and EBIT margin (defined as EBIT divided by net sales) and total segment EBIT margin, are financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes\n. Adjusted EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA (defined as earnings excluding interest expense, net, related party interest income, income taxes, intangibles amortization expense, restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees, and certain gains, losses or impairments) and adjusted EBITA margin and adjusted segment EBITA margin (defined as adjusted EBITA divided by net sales) are measures used by management to evaluate the Company's operational performance, as they exclude the impact of acquisition-related investments and non-operational items. EBITDA (defined as EBIT excluding depreciation and amortization) and EBITDA margin (defined as EBITDA divided by net sales) are also used as measures of the Company's current operating performance, as they exclude the impact of capital and acquisition-related investments. Adjusted EBITDA (defined as EBITDA excluding restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees, and certain gains, losses or impairments) and adjusted EBITDA margin (defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales) are also used to exclude the impact of non-operational items. All of these are commonly used financial measures utilized by management to evaluate performance (U.S. GAAP measures:\npretax earnings or pretax profit margin, segment earnings or segment margin\n).\nEarnings and earnings per share excluding certain gains and losses, impairments, restructuring costs, impacts of acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, discrete taxes, or other items provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items. Management believes that presenting earnings and earnings per\n17\nshare excluding these items is more representative of the Company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors (U.S. GAAP measures:\nearnings, earnings per share\n).\nFree cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) and free cash flow as a percent of net sales are indicators of the Company’s cash generating capabilities, and dividends as a percent of free cash flow is an indicator of the Company's ability to support its divid\nend, after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. The determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Managemen\nt believes that free cash flow, free cash flow as a percent of net sales and dividends as a percent of free cash flow are useful to both management and investors as measures of the Company’s ability to generate cash and support its dividend (U.S. GAAP measures:\noperating cash flow, operating cash flow as a percent of net sales, dividends as a percent of operating cash flow\n).\n18\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nReport of Management\nThe Company's management is responsible for the integrity and accuracy of the financial statements. Management believes that the financial statements for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances. In preparing the financial statements, management makes informed judgments and estimates where necessary to reflect the expected effects of events and transactions that have not been completed. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures ensure that material information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to management and reported within the required time periods.\nIn meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial statements, management relies on a system of internal accounting controls. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Although the design of this system recognizes that errors or irregularities may occur, management believes that the Company's internal accounting controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that could be material to the financial statements are prevented or would be detected within a timely period.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee meets with management and the Company's internal auditors periodically to review the work of each and to monitor the discharge by each of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors, who have free access to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, to discuss the quality and acceptability of the Company's financial reporting and internal controls, as well as nonaudit-related services.\nThe independent auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Their opinions are based on procedures that they believe to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements contain no material errors and that the Company's internal controls are effective.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the frame\nwork and the criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company's auditor, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n19\nResults of Operations\nYears ended September 30\n(Dollars in Item 7 are in millions, except per share amounts or where noted)\nOVERVIEW\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of National Instruments Corporation (\"NI\"), which is now referred to as Test & Measurement and reported as a new segment in the Software and Control business group. NI provides software-connected automated test and measurement systems that enable enterprises to bring products to market faster and at a lower cost, and had revenues of approximately $1.7 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 4.\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to private equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receivable to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss in continuing operations of $279 ($217 after-tax, $0.38 per share) to adjust the carrying value of the note to $1.9 billion to reflect the transaction price, while the Company recognized a gain of $539 ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations upon the sale of the common equity interest. In addition, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, have been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Notes 5 and 8 for further detail.\n20\nOverall, in 2024 sales were $17.5 billion, up 15 percent compared with the prior year. Underlying sales, which exclude foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, were up 6 percent. The Test & Measurement acquisition added 9.5 percent and the divestiture of Metran, Emerson's Russia-based manufacturing subsidiary, deducted 0.5 percent.\nNet earnings\nfrom continuing operations\nattributable to common stockholders were $1,618 in 2024, down 29 percent compared with prior year earnings of $2,286, and diluted earnings per share\nfrom continuing operations\nwere $2.82, down 29 percent versus $3.96 in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to purchase accounting related impacts from the NI acquisition and higher associated restructuring charges, and the loss on the sale of the Copeland note receivable. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $5.49 compared with $4.44 in the prior year, reflecting sales growth and strong operating performance, as well as a $0.45 contribution from Test & Measurement.\nThe Company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $3.3 billion in 2024, an increase of $607, or 22 percent, reflecting higher earnings (excluding the impact of non-cash items related to the NI acquisition and the loss on the Copeland note receivable).\nThe table below presents the Company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on an adjusted basis to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excludes intangibles amortization expense, restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction-related costs, interest income on undeployed proceeds related to the Copeland transaction, gains or losses on the Copeland equity method investment, and certain gains, losses or impairments.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. The items identified below are discussed throughout MD&A, see further discussion above and in the Business Segments and Financial Position sections below.\n21\nNET SALES\nNet sales for 2024 were $17.5 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion, or 15 percent compared with 2023. Intelligent Devices sales increased 5 percent, while Software and Control sales increased 48 percent,\nwhich included the impact of the Test & Measurement acquisition. Underlying sales were up 6 percent on 4 percent higher volume and 2 percent higher price. The Test & Measurement acquisition added 9.5 percent and the divestiture of Metran deducted 0.5 percent. Underlying sales were up 2 percent in the U.S. and up 9 percent internationally.\nNet sales for 2023 were $15.2 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 10 percent compared with\n2022\n. Intelligent Devices sales increased 7 percent, while Software and Control sales increased 20 percent, which included the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. Underlying sales increased 10 percent\non 6 percent higher volume and 4 percent higher price. Foreign currency translation subtracted\n2 percent\n, the Heritage AspenTech acquisition added 3 percent and the divestiture of Metran deducted 1 percent\n. Underlying sales were up 11 percent in the U.S. and up 9 percent internationally.\nINTERNATIONAL SALES\nEmerson is a global business with international sales representing 60 percent of total sales in 2024, including U.S. exports\n. The Company generally expects faster economic growth in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Middle East/Africa.\nInternational destination sales, including U.S. exports, increased 18 percent, to $10.5 billion in 2024,\nreflecting the Company's overall increase in sales and the impact of the Test & Measurement acquisition. U.S. expo\nrts of $1.3 billion were up 26 percent compared with 2023. Underlying international destination sales were up 9 percent and t\nhe Test & Measurement acquisition added 9 percent. Underlying sales increased 7 percent in\nEurope, 8 percent in Asia, Middle East & Africa (China down 3 percent), 21 percent in Latin America and 5 percent in Canada.\nOrigin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled\n$9.3 billion\nin 2024,\nup 20 percent\ncompared with 2023.\nInternational destination sales, including U.S. exports, increased 9 percent, to $8.9 billion in 2023, reflecting the Company's overall increase in sales and the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. U.S\n. exports of $1.0 billion were up 6 percent compared with 2022\n. Underlying international destination sales were up 9 percent, as foreign currency translation had a 3 percent unfavorable impact on the comparison, the Heritage AspenTech acquisition added 3 percent and the divestiture of Metran deducted 1 percent. Underlying sales\nincreased\n10 percent in Europe, 9 percent in Asia, Middle East & Africa (China up 4 percent), 14 percent in Latin Americ\na and 1 percent in Canada.\nOrigin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $7.7 billion in 2023, up 5 percent compared with 2022.\n22\nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nPortfolio management is an integral component of Emerson's growth and value creation strategy. Over the past three years, the Company has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and divestitures of non-core businesses. These actions were undertaken to create a cohesive, higher growth and higher margin industrial technology portfolio as a global automation leader serving a diversified set of end markets. The Company’s recent portfolio actions include the following transactions:\nOn November 5, 2024, the Company announced a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of AspenTech not already owned by Emerson for $240 per share in cash, which implies a fully diluted market capitalization for AspenTech of $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $15.1 billion. The Company currently owns approximately 57 percent of AspenTech's outstanding shares of common stock. The proposal is not subject to any financing condition and would be financed from cash on hand, committed lines of credit and/or other available sources of financing. Also on November 5, 2024, the Company announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives, including a cash sale, for its Safety & Productivity segment. No assurance can be given whether the proposal or the review will lead to one or more transactions or as to any of the terms or conditions of such transactions. See Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for additional information.\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of National Instruments Corporation (\"NI\") at an equity value of $8.2 billion. NI, which provides software-connected automated test and measurement systems that enable enterprises to bring products to market faster and at a lower cost, had revenues of approximately $1.7 billion and pretax earnings of approximately $170 for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023.\nIn 2023, the Company acquired two businesses, Flexim, which is reported in the Measurement & Analytical segment, and Afag, which is reported in the Discrete Automation segment, for $715, net of cash acquired.\nOn March 31, 2023, Emerson completed the divestiture of Metran, its Russia-based manufacturing subsidiary. In 2023, the Company recognized a pretax loss of $47 in Other deductions ($47 after-tax, in total\n$0.08\nper share) related to its exit of business operations in Russia. The Company had previously announced its intention to exit business operations in 2022 and recognized a pretax loss of $181 ($190 after-tax, in total $0.32 per share). This charge included a loss of $36 in operations and $145 reported in Other deductions ($10 of which is reported in restructuring costs) and was primarily non-cash. Emerson's historical net sales in Russia represented approximately 2.0 percent of consolidated annual sales.\nOn May 31, 2023, the Company completed the sale of a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the former Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone in a $14.0 billion transaction. The Company recognized a pretax gain of approximately $10.6 billion (approximately $8.4 billion after-tax including tax expense recognized in prior quarters related to subsidiary restructurings). The standalone business is named Copeland.\nSubsequently, on June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to private equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receivable to Copeland for $1.9 billion and the transactions were completed in August 2024. See Notes 5 and 8 and the discussion below for further details.\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion, and the Company recognized a pretax gain of approximately $2.8 billion (approximately $2.1 billion after-tax) in 2023.\nOn May 31, 2022 the Company completed the divestiture of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $486 ($429 after-tax) in 2022.\nClimate Technologies (including equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland), Therm-O-Disc and InSinkErator are reported within discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nOn May 16, 2022, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"Heritage AspenTech\") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectively, the “Emerson\n23\nIndustrial Software Business”), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\" (defined as \"AspenTech\" herein). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech’s previous name “Aspen Technology, Inc.” and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech’s previous stock ticker symbol “AZPN.” Due to the timing of the acquisition, the results for the first half of fiscal 2022 do not include the results of Heritage AspenTech.\nSee Notes 4, 5 and 8 and Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for further information on acquisitions and divestitures.\nCOST OF SALES\nCost of sales for 2024 were $8,607, an increase of $869 compared with $7,738 in 2023, reflecting the impact of higher volume and the Test & Measurement acquisition. Gross profit was $8,885 in 2024 compared to $7,427 in 2023, while gross margin increased\n1.8 percentage poi\nnts to 50.8 percent, reflecting the Test & Measurement acquisition and higher price partially offset by the impact from acquisition-related inventory step-up amortization of $231, which negatively impacted margins by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\nCost of sales for 2023 were\n$7,738\n, an increase of\n$240\ncompared with\n$7,498\nin\n2022. G\nross profit was\n$7,427\nin 2023 compared to\n$6,306\nin\n2022\n, while gross margin increased 3.3 percentage points to\n49.0 percent due to favorable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by 0.6 percentage points, and favorable mix.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSG&A expenses of $5,142 in 2024 increased $956 compared with 2023 and SG&A as a percent of sales increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.4 percent, reflecting the impact of the Test & Measurement acquisition, partially offset by strong operating leverage on higher sales.\nSG&A expenses of $4,186 in 2023 increased $572 compared with 2022 and SG&A as a percent of sales increased 1.4 percentage points to 27.6 percent, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $125, of which $75 related to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans. These items were partially offset by strong operating leverage on higher sales.\nSALE OF COPELAND NOTE RECEIVABLE AND EQUITY INTEREST\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to private equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receivable to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss in continuing operations of $279 ($217 after-tax, $0.38 per share) to adjust the carrying value of the note to $1.9 billion to reflect the transaction price, while the Company recognized a gain of $539 ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations upon the sale of the common equity interest. In addition, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, have been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nGAIN ON SUBORDINATED INTEREST\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company received a distribution of $438 related to its subordinated interest in Vertiv (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter of 2022, $358 after-tax, $0.60 per share) and received the remaining $15 related to the pretax gain in the first quarter of 2023. In 2023, the Company received additional distributions totaling $161 ($122 after-tax, $0.21 per share) and in 2024, received its final distribution of $79 ($60 after-tax, $0.10 per share).\nOTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\nOther deductions, net were $1,434 in 2024, an increase of $928 compared with 2023. The current year included intangibles amortization related to the Test & Measurement acquisition of $560, while restructuring costs increased by $156 and acquisition/divestiture costs increased by $27. The Company also incurred divestiture losses of $48 ($50 after-tax, $0.09 per share).\nOther deductions, net were $506 in 2023, a decrease of $13 compared with\n2022\n, and included higher intangibles amortization of $146 primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency transactions of $112 reflecting losses in the current year compared to gains in the prior year. The prior year included a charge of $145 related to the Company exiting its business in Russia compared to a charge of $47 in\n24\n2023. In 2023, the Company recognized a mark-to-market gain of $56 on its equity investment in NI, and a mark-to-market gain of $24 r\nelated to foreign currency forward contracts entered into by AspenTech to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated with the Micromine purchase price compared to a loss of $50 in 2022.\nOn June 21, 2023, AspenTech terminated all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.\nSee Notes 6 and 7.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET\nInterest expense, net was\n$175\n,\n$34\nand\n$194\nin 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Results in 2023 included interest income on undeployed proceeds from the Copeland transaction of $141 ($108 after-tax, $0.19 per share).\nInterest income from related party was\n$86 and $41 in 2024 and 2023, respectively and\nreflects n\non-cash interest income on the Copeland note receivable, which was capitalized to the carrying value of the note through the date of the sale agreement.\nEARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\nPretax earnings from conti\nnuing operations of $2,020 decreased $883 in 2024, down 30 percent compared with 2023, which included the impact of acquisition-related inventory step-up amortization, higher amortization due to the Test & Measurement acquisition, and the loss on the Copeland note receivable discussed above. Earnings increased\n$191 in Intelligent Devices and decreased $140 in Software and\nControl.\nPretax earnings from continuing operations of $2,903 increased $471 in 2023, up 19 percent compared with\n2022. Earnings\nincreased $447 in Intelligent Devices and decreased $27 in Software and Contr\nol. See the Business Segments discussion that follows and\nNote 20.\nINCOME TAXES\nIn\ncome taxes were $415, $642 and $549 for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 21 percent, 22 percent and 23 percent in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The current year rate included a $57 ($0.10 per share) benefit related to discrete tax items and a benefit related to the filing of the prior year U.S. tax return, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from inventory step-up amortization and the divestiture losses (see Note 4), which were non-deductible for tax purposes. In total, the net impact of these items benefited the rate by approximately 1 percentage point. See Note 16.\nNET\nEARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nNet earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders in 2024 were $1,618, down 29 percent compared with 2023, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.82, down 29 percent compared with $3.96 in 2023, reflecting the impact of acquisition-related inventory step-up amortization, higher amortization due to the Test & Measurement acquisition, and the loss on the Copeland note receivable discussed above. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $5.49 compared with $4.44 in the prior year. See the\nanalysis of adjusted earnings per share in the Overview section for further detai\nls. Earnings from discontinued operations attributable to common stockholders in 2024 were $350 ($0.61 per share) and included the gain on the sale of the Company's 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland of $539 ($435 after-tax).

Emerson is in a strong financial position, with total assets of $44 billion and stockholders' equity of $22 billion, and has the resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis.\nThe Company continues to generate substantial operating cash flow, including over $3.3 billion from continuing operations in 2024. Cash flows have been and are expected to be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet\n30\nthe Company’s operating requirements, including those related to salaries and wages, working capital, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with operations. Th\ne Company also has certain contractual obligations, primarily long-term debt and operating leases (see Notes 9, 12 and 13). The\nCompany has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet its needs for the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, short- and long-term debt capacity, or its $3.5 billion revolving backup credit facility under which it has not incurred any borrowings.\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations for 2024 was $3.3 billion, an increase of $607, or 22 percent compared with 2023, reflecting higher earnings (excluding the impact of non-cash items related to the NI acquisition and the loss on the Copeland note receivable). Acquisition-related costs and integration activities negatively impacted operating cash flow in the current year by approximately $235. AspenTech generated operating cash flow of approximately $320 compared to approximately $310 in the prior year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for 2023 was $2.7 billion, an increase of 32 percent compared to $2.0 billion in 2022, reflecting higher earnings (excluding the impacts in both years from the Vertiv subordinated interest gains and higher Heritage AspenTech intangibles amortization in 2023).\nAt September 30, 2024, operating working capital as a percent of sales was 8.0 percent compared with 8.5 percent in 2023 and 7.2 percent in 2022. Total operating working capital increased in 2024 due to the NI acquisition, but improved as a percent of sales compared to 2023 due improvements in inventory levels. Operating working capital was elevated in 2023 due to higher inventory levels to support sales growth and higher receivables.\nFree cash flow from continuing operations (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) was $2,898 in 2024, up 23 percent, reflecting the increase in operating cash flow. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $2,347 in 2023, compared with $1,749 in 2022. Net cash paid in connection with acquisitions was $8,342, $705 and $5,702 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTotal cash provided by operating activities including the impact of discontinued operations was $3,332, $637 and $2,922 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in 2023 was due to approximately $2.3 billion of income taxes paid related to the gains on the Copeland transaction and InSinkErator divestiture and subsidiary restructurings related to the Copeland transaction. Investing cash flow from discontinued operations was $3.4 billion in 2024, reflecting\nthe proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion related to the sale of the Company's 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland and $1.9 billion related to the sale of the note receivable, while 2023 was $12.5 billion, reflecting\nthe proceeds from the Copeland transaction and InSinkErator divestiture.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and among other things, provides tax relief to businesses. Tax provisions of the CARES Act included the deferral of certain payroll taxes, relief for retaining employees, and other provisions. The Company deferred $73 of certain payroll taxes through the end of calendar year 2020, of which approximately $37 was paid in December 2021 and the remainder paid in December 2022.\nDividends were $1,201 ($2.10 per share) in 2024, compared with $1,198 ($2.08 per share) in 2023 and $1,223 ($2.06 per share) in 2022. In November 2024, the Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend to an annualized rate of $2.11 per share.\n31\nPurchases of Emerson common stock totaled $435, $2,000 and $500 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, at average per share prices of $99.04, $94.09 and $87.64. AspenTech repurchases were $208 in 2024 and $214 in 2023, and the Company's current common ownership percentage is approximately 57 percent. In November 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 70 million shares, and during 2022, the remaining shares available under this authorization were purchased. In March 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 60 million shares and a total of approximately 28.9 million shares remain available. The Company purchased 4.4 million shares in 2024, 21.3 million shares in 2023 and 5.7 million shares in 2022 under the authorizations.\nTotal debt, which includes long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, was $7,687, $8,157 and $10,374 as of September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in 2024 reflected the repayment of\n€500\nof\n0.375%\neuro notes that matured in May 2024. The decrease in 2023 included a net reduction in short-term borrowings of approximately $1.6 billion and repayments of long-term debt of\n$741\n(including $264 related to AspenTech's repayment of the outstanding balance on its existing term loan facility plus accrued interest). Activity in 2022 included the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt and increased commercial paper borrowings of approximately $1.3 billion. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and the increased commercial paper borrowings to fund the majority of its contribution of approximately $6.0 billion to existing stockholders of Heritage AspenTech as part of the transaction. Long-term debt was issued in December 2021 as follows: $1 billion of 2.0% notes due December 2028, $1 billion of 2.2% notes due December 2031, and $1 billion of 2.8% notes due December 2051. Additionally, the Company repaid $500 of 2.625% notes that matured in 2022. See Note 4 and Note 13.\nThe total debt-to-total capital ratio decreased slightly in 2024, reflecting repayments of long-term debt, while the net debt-to-net capital ratio increased reflecting the use of cash held on the balance sheet at September 30, 2023 that was used to complete the NI acquisition. These ratios decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the proceeds and after-tax gains (which increased common stockholder's equity) on the Copeland transaction and InSinkErator divestiture. The interest coverage ratio is computed as earnings before income taxes plus interest expense, divided by interest expense. The decrease in 2024 reflects lower GAAP pretax earnings largely due to the NI acquisition. Excluding the impact from acquisition-related inventory step-up amortization of $231, higher intangibles amortization of $595, acquisition/divestiture fees and related costs of $220, higher restructuring and related costs of $152, the loss of $279 on the Copeland note receivable and the gain on the subordinated interest of $79, the interest coverage ratio was 11.6X. The Company's earnings increased in 2023 which offset higher interest expense due to the increased long-term debt and commercial paper borrowings to fund the Heritage AspenTech acquisition.\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility with various banks, which replaced the May 2018 $3.5 billion facility. The credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowings. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities. The credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate alternatives at the Company’s option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial.\nThe Company also maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or\nshare purchase units without a predetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale.\n32\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates due to its worldwide presence\nand diverse business pr\nofile and selectively uses derivative financial instruments, including forwards, swaps and purchased options to manage these risks. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to fo\nrecast the impact of these movements. Based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates or a 10 percent weakening in the U.S. dollar across all currencies, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value or cash flows are not material. Sensitivity analysis has limitations; for example, a weaker U.S. dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of non-U.S. operating results. See Notes 1, and 11 through 13.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of  manufactured products and software which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms, or the first day of the contractual term for software. A portion of the Company's revenues relate to the sale of post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering services.\nIn some circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance. In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on thi\nrd-party pricing or management's best estimate. For projects where revenue is recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer. The Company also has software maintenance contracts where revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.\nVALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nAssets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, including intangible assets, are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. In 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of National Instruments Corporation and in 2022 completed the acquisition of Aspen Technology, Inc. and engaged independent third-party valuation specialists to assist in the determination of the fair value of intangible assets. This included the use of certain assumptions and estimates, including projected revenue for customer relationship and developed technology intangible assets, the attrition rate for customer relationship intangible assets, and the obsolescence rate for developed technology intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate, they require judgement and are based on experience and historical information obtained from National Instruments Corporation and Aspen Technology, Inc.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist. If\n33\nthe Company determines that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk. Estimates of future sales, operating results, cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including such factors as the general level of market interest rates, expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served, particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time.\nRETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a prudent long-term investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations. The determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions, including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the Compa\nny's assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods. The Company's principal U.S. defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016. Effective January 1, 2025, the Company is implementing a new profit sharing retirement program for all U.S. non-union employees. Eligible employees will receive a base contribution to a cash balance account administered within the principal U.S. defined benefit plan, to be funded by surplus pension assets, as well as a potential profit sharing contribution to their defined contribution account. After December 31, 2024, future service for employees that had continued to accrue benefits in the principal U.S. defined benefit plan will be frozen.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $800 in total (approximately 22 percent in excess of the projected benefit obligation), including unfunded plans totaling $161. The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $38, including unfunded plans totaling $230. The Company contributed a total of $38 to defined benefit plans in 2024 and expects to contribute approximately $40 in 2025. At year-end 2024, the discount rate for U.S. plans was 4.97 percent, and was 6.03 percent in 2023. The assumed investment return on plan assets was 6.50 percent in 2024, 6.00 percent in 2023 and 6.00 percent in 2022, and will be 6.50 percent for 2025. While management believes its assumptions used are appropriate, actual experience may differ. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the U.S. and non-U.S. discount rates would have increased the total projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2024 by $100 and increased 2025 pension expense by $15. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase 2025 pension expense by $15. See Note 1\n4.\nCONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nThe Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos)\nand other matters, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. T\nhe Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivables. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. See Note 15.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid (received) on items included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be\n34\nrecovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies.\nUncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.\nCash repatriated to the U.S. is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. No provision is made for withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries where these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. See Notes 1 and 16.\nOther Items\nLEGAL MATTERS\nAt September 30, 2024, there were no known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commit\nments outside the normal course of business.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn 2024, the Company adopted ASU No. 2022-04 (Subtopic 405-50),\nLiabilities - Supplier Finance Programs,\nwhich requires disclosures about the use of supplier finance programs. This standard has no impact on the accounting for supplier finance programs and did not materially impact the Company's disclosures.\nIn 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2021-10 (Topic 832),\nGovernment Assistance,\nwhich requires annual disclosures about certain types of government assistance received. This standard has no impact on the accounting for government assistance and did not materially impact the Company's disclosures.\nIn 2022, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates, each of which had an immaterial or no impact on the Company's financial statements. These included:\n•\nUpdates to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n, which clarify the accounting for contract assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair value in accordance with the general requirements of ASC 805.\n•\nUpdates to ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes\n, which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income based tax. These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim tax calculations.\n•\nUpdates to ASC 321,\nEquity Securities\n, ASC 323\nInvestments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures\n, and ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n, which clarify how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when evaluating observable transactions.\n35\nFISCAL 2025 OUTLOOK\nFor fiscal year 2025, consolidated net sales from continuing operations are expected to be up 3.5 to 5.5 percent, with underlying sales up 3 to 5 percent, excluding a 0.5 percent favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Earnings per share are expected to be $4.42 to $4.62, while adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $5.85 to $6.05 (see the following reconciliation).\nOperating cash flow is expected to be $3.6 to $3.7 billion and free cash flow, which excludes projected capital spending of approximately $0.4 billion, is expected to be $3.2 to $3.3 billion. The fiscal 2025 outlook assumes approximately $2.0 billion returned to shareholders through share repurchases (including approximately $1.0 billion expected to be completed in the first fiscal quarter) and approximately $1.2 billion of dividend payments."

Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell its\n40\npercent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to private equity funds managed by Blackstone for $\n1.5\nbillion and its note receivable to Copeland for $\n1.9\nbillion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. As a result of these transactions, the equity interest and note receivable are reported as held-for-sale in the prior year, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, have been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented, and cash flows related to U.S. tax distributions have been reclassified to operating cash flows from discontinued operations (see Notes 5 and 8).\nIn 2024, the Company adopted ASU No. 2022-04 (Subtopic 405-50),\nLiabilities - Supplier Finance Programs,\nwhich requires disclosures about the use of supplier finance programs. This standard has no impact on the accounting for supplier finance programs and did not materially impact the Company's disclosures.\nIn 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2021-10 (Topic 832),\nGovernment Assistance,\nwhich requires annual disclosures about certain types of government assistance received. This standard has no impact on the accounting for government assistance and did not materially impact the Company's disclosures.\nIn 2022, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates, each of which had an immaterial or no impact on the Company's financial statements. These included:\n•\nUpdates to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n, which clarify the accounting for contract assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair value in accordance with the general requirements of ASC 805.\n•\nUpdates to ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes\n, which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income based tax. These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim tax calculations.\n•\nUpdates to ASC 321,\nEquity Securities\n, ASC 323\nInvestments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures\n, and ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n, which clarify how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when evaluating observable transactions.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled affiliates. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments of 20 percent to 50 percent of the voting shares of other entities are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in publicly traded companies of less than 20 percent are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. Investments in nonpublicly traded companies of less than 20 percent are carried at cost, minus impairment, and adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency for most of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.\n42\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The majority of inventory is valued based on standard costs, which are revised at the beginning of each year and approximate average costs, while the remainder is principally valued on a first-in, first-out basis.\nFollowing are the components of inventory as of September 30:\nFair Value Measurement\nASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement\n, establishes a formal hierarchy and framework for measuring certain financial statement items at fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements and the reliability of valuation inputs. Under ASC 820, measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Within the hierarchy, Level 1 instruments use observable market prices for an identical item in active markets and have the most reliable valuations. Level 2 instruments are valued through broker/dealer quotation or other approaches using market-observable inputs for similar items in active markets, including forward and spot prices, interest rates and volatilities. Level 3 instruments are valued using inputs not observable in an active market, such as company-developed future cash flow estimates, and are considered the least reliable. Valuations for all of the Company's financial instruments fall within Level 2. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is Level 2, estimated using current interest rates and pricing from financial institutions and other market sources for debt with similar maturities and characteristics.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Company records investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment at cost. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over estimated service lives, which for principal assets are\n30\nto\n40\nyears for buildings and\n8\nto\n12\nyears for machinery and equipment. Long-lived tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized based on estimated fair values if the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less than the carrying values.\nThe components of property, plant and equipment as of September 30 follow:\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAssets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. Substantially all goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that acquires a business. A reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in ASC 280,\nSegment Reporting\n, or a business one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information for that business unit is prepared and regularly reviewed by the segment manager. The Company conducts annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be impaired, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. An impairment charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a unit may be less than its carrying value. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures and are developed generally\n43\nunder an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.\nWith the exception of certain trade names, all of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Ident\nifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as technology, patents and trademarks, customer relationships and capitalized software. Identifiable intangibles are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nSee Note 10.\nLeases\nThe Company leases offices; manufacturing facilities and equipment; and transportation, information technology and office equipment under operating lease arrangements. Finance lease arrangements are immaterial. The Company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expense. The discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\nCertain leases contain renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the variable portion is recorded as variable lease expense. The Company's leases typically do not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nProduct Warranty\nWarranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties are largely offered to provide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period of\none\nto\ntwo years\nfrom the date of sale or installation. Provisions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. Product warranty expense is less than one-half of one percent of sales.\nRevenue Recognition\nEmerson is a global manufacturer that designs and manufactures products and delivers services that bring technology and engineering together to provide innovative solutions for its customers. The Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of  manufactured products and software which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms, or the first day of the contractual term for software. A portion of the Company's revenues relate to the sale of post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering services. In some circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as\nwell as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer.\nRevenue is recognized over time for approximately\n10\npercent\nof the Company's revenues. These revenues primarily relate to projects in the Control Systems & Software segment where revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control over time, and software maintenance contracts in the Software and Control business group where revenue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis. Approximately\n15\npercent\nof revenues relate to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations, principally in the Software and Control business group. T\nangible products represent a large majority\nof the delivered\n44\nitems in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance.\nFor projects where revenue is recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer. For software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.\nIn sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. Generally, contract duration is short-term, and cancellation, termination or refund provisions apply only in the event of contract breach and are rarely invoked.\nPayment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company's long-term contracts, where revenue is generally recognized over time, are typically billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year.\nCertain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash discounts or penalties. In limited circumstances, the Company sells products with a general right of return. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receive. The Company's estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue is recognized.\nSee Notes 2 and 20 for additional information about the Company's revenues.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates due to its worldwide presence\nand diverse business pr\nofile. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its business units, primarily in euros, Mexican pesos, and Chinese yuan. As part of the Company's risk management strategy, derivative instruments are selectively used in an effort to minimize the impact of these exposures. Foreign exchange forwards and options are utilized to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm commitments and the fair value of assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar obligations are utilized to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's net investments in foreign operations. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The duration of hedge positions is generally\ntwo years\nor less, except for the Company's net investment hedges.\nAll derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n, and recognized at fair value. For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in stockholders' equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The majority of the Company's derivatives that are designated as hedges and qualify for hedge accounting are cash flow hedges. For derivatives hedging the fair value of existing assets or liabilities, both the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in earnings each period. Currency fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar obligations that have been designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to income in the same period when a foreign operation is sold or substantially liquidated and the gain or loss related to the sale is included in income. To the extent that any hedge is not fully effective at offsetting changes in the underlying hedged item, there could be a net earnings impact.\nThe Company also uses derivatives to he\ndge economic exposures that do not receive hedge accounting under ASC 815. The underlying exposures for these hedges relate primarily to the revaluation of certain foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities. In addition, in 2022 AspenTech entered into foreign currency forward contracts to\n45\nmitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated\nwith\nthe Micromine purchase price. On June 21, 2023, AspenTech terminated all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts and on August 1, 2023, announced the termination of the agreement to purchase Micromine. Gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedges are recognized in the income statement immediately.\nCounterparties to derivative arrangements are companies with investment-grade credit ratings. The Company has bilateral collateral arrangements with counterparties with credit rating-based posting thresholds that vary depending on the arrangement. If credit ratings on the Company's debt fall below pre-established levels, counterparties can require immediate full collateralization on all derivatives in net liability positions. The maximum amount that could potentially have been required was immaterial. The Company also can demand full collateralization of derivatives in net asset positions should any counterparty credit ratings fall below certain thresholds.\nNo\ncollateral was posted with counterparties and\nnone\nwas held by the Company at year end. Risk from credit loss when derivatives are in asset positions is not considered material. The Company has master netting arrangements in place with its counterparties that allow the offsetting of certain derivative-related amounts receivable and payable when settlement occurs in the same period. Accordingly, counterparty balances are netted in the consolidated balance sheet and are reported in other current assets or accrued expenses as appropriate, depending on positions with counterparties as of the balance sheet date.\nSee Note 11.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is based on pretax income reported in the consolidated statements of earnings and tax rates currently enacted in each jurisdiction. Certain income and expense items are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting and income tax filing purposes, and deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects the Company to U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company has elected to recognize this tax as a period expense when it is incurred. The Company also provides for withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes on earnings intended to be repatriated from non-U.S. locations. No provision has been made for these taxes on approxim\nately\n$\n6.3\nbillion\no\nf undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024, as these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations. Recognition of withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes on undistributed non-U.S. earnings would be triggered by a management decision to repatriate those earnings. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable.\nSee Note 16.\n(2)\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe following table summarizes the balances of the Company's unbilled receivables (contract assets), which are reported in Other assets (current and noncurrent), and its customer advances (contract liabilities), which are reported in Accrued expenses and Other liabilities.\nThe majority of the Company's contract balances relate to (1) arrangements where revenue is recognized over time and payments from customers are made according to a contractual billing schedule, and (2) revenue from term software lice\nnse arrangements sold by AspenTech where the license revenue is recognized upfront upon delivery.\nThe decrease in net contract assets was primarily due to the acquisition of National Instruments, which increased contract liabilities by approximately $\n150\n, while customer billings slightly exceeded\nrevenue recognized for performance completed during the period.\nRevenue recognized for 2024 included approximately $\n635\nthat was included in the beginning contract liability balanc\ne. Other factors that impacted the change in net contract liabilities were\nimmaterial.\nRevenue recognized for 2024 for performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, including cumulative catchup adjustments on the Company's long-term contracts, was not material. Capitalized amounts related to incremental costs to obtain customer contracts and costs to fulfill contracts are immaterial.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's backlog relating to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations in contracts with its customers was approximately $\n8.4\nbillion (of which approximately $\n1.3\nbillion\nwas attributable to AspenTech and approximately\n$\n400\nwas attributable to National Instruments).\nThe Company expects\n46\nto recognize approxima\ntely\n75\npercent of\nits remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next\n12\nmonths, with the remainder substantially over the subsequent\ntwo years\nthereafter.\nSee Note 20 for additional information about the Company's revenues.\n(3)\nWEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES\nBasic earnings per common share consider only the weighted-average of common shares outstanding while diluted earnings per common share, which are calculated using the two-class method, also consider the dilutive effects of stock options and incentive shares. An inconsequential number of shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of dilutive earnings per share in 2024, 2023 and 2022 as the effect would have been antidilutive. Earnings allocated to participating securities were inconsequential for all years presented.\nReconciliations of weighted-average shares for basic and diluted earnings per common share follow (shares in millions):\n(4)\nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nNational Instruments\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of National Instruments Corporation (“NI”). NI, which provides software-connected automated test and measurement systems that enable enterprises to bring products to market faster and at a lower cost, had revenues of approximately\n$\n1.7\nbillion and pretax earnings of approximately\n$\n170\nfor the 12 months ended September 30, 2023. NI is now referred to as Test & Measurement and reported as a new segment in the Software and Control business group, see Note 20.\nThe following table summarizes the components of the purchase consideration reflected in the acquisition accounting for NI.\nThe total purchase consideration for NI was allocated to assets and liabilities as follows.\n47\nThe estimated intangible assets attributable to the transaction are comprised of the following\n(in millions)\n:\nResults of operations for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nattributable to the NI acquisition include sales of\n$\n1,464\nand a net loss of\n$\n537\n. The net loss included the impact of inventory step-up amortization, intangibles amortization, retention bonuses, stock compensation expense and restructuring.\nPro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited proforma consolidated condensed financial results of operations are presented as if the acquisition of NI occurred on October 1, 2022.\nThe pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the acquisition occurred as of that time ($ in millions, except per share amounts).\nPro forma Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2023 include\n$\n1,693\nattributable to NI.\nThe pro forma results for the year ended September 30, 2023 include transaction costs of\n$\n198\nwhich were assumed to be incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. These transaction costs include\n$\n88\nincurred by NI prior to the completion of the transaction and\n$\n110\nincurred by Emerson in periods subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The pro forma results for the year ended September 30, 2023 also include\n$\n424\nof\nongoing intangibles amortization, backlog amortization of\n$\n136\n, inventory step-up amortization of\n$\n213\n,\nand retention bonuses of\n$\n55\n, and exclude the mark-to-market gain of\n$\n56\nrecognized on the equity investment in National Instruments Corporation (see Note 6).\n48\nAspen Technology\nOn May 16, 2022, the Company\ncompleted the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"Heritage AspenTech\") to contribute\ntwo\nof Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (\ncollectively, the “Emerson Industrial Software Business”)\n, along with approximately $\n6.0\nbillion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (defined as \"AspenTech\" herein). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson beneficially owned\n55\npercent\nof the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis) and former Heritage AspenTech stockholders owned the remaining outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock. AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech’s previous name “Aspen Technology, Inc.” and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech’s previous stock ticker symbol “AZPN.”\nThe business combination has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with Emerson considered the accounting acquirer of Heritage AspenTech. The net assets of Heritage AspenTech were recorded at their estimated fair value and the Emerson Industrial Software Business continues at its historical basis. The Company recorded a noncontrolling interest of\n$\n5.9\nbillion\nfor the\n45\npercent ownership interest of former Heritage AspenTech stockholders in AspenTech. The noncontrolling interest associated with the Heritage AspenTech acquired net assets was recorded at fair value determined using the closing market price per share of Heritage AspenTech as of May 16, 2022, while the portion attributable to the Emerson Industrial Software business was recorded at its historical carrying amount. The impact of recognizing the noncontrolling interest in the Emerson Industrial Software Business resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in-capital of $\n550\n.\nThe following table summarizes the components of the purchase consideration reflected in the acquisition accounting using Heritage AspenTech's shares outstanding and closing market price per share as of May 16, 2022 (in millions except share and per share data):\nThe total purchase consideration for Heritage AspenTech was allocated to assets and liabilities as follows.\n49\nEmerson's cash contribution of\napproximately $\n6.0\nbillion was paid out at approximately $\n87.69\nper share (on a fully diluted basis) to holders of issued and outstanding shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock as of the closing of the transactions, with $\n168\nof cash remaining on AspenTech's balance sheet as of the closing which is not included in the allocation of purchase consideration above.\nThe estimated intangible assets attributable to the transaction are comprised of the following\n(in millions)\n:\nResults of operations for 2023 attributable to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition include sales of $\n752\ncompared to $\n356\nfor 2022, while the impact to GAAP net earnings was not material in both years.\nPro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited proforma consolidated condensed financial results of operations are presented as if the acquisition of Heritage AspenTech occurred on Oct\nober 1, 2020.\nThe pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the acquisition occurred as of that time ($ in millions, except per share amounts).\nThe pro forma results for 2022 exclude $\n91\nof transaction costs which were included in the Company's reported results for 2022, but were assumed to be incurred in the first quarter of 2021. The pro forma results for 2022 include additional interest expense of $\n56\nrelated to the issuance of\n$\n3.0\nbillion\nof term debt and increased commercial paper borrowings to fund the acquisition, which assumes such borrowings were outstanding for the entire year.\nOther Transactions\nIn 2024, the Company divested\ntwo\nsmall businesses, both in the Final Control segment, and recognized a pretax loss of $\n48\nin total ($\n50\nafter-tax, $\n0.09\nper share).\nIn 2023, the Company acquired\ntwo\nbusinesses, Flexim, which is reported in the Measurement & Analytical segment, and Afag, which is reported in the Discrete Automation segment, for $\n715\n, net of cash acquired. The Company recognized goodwill of $\n424\n(\nnone\nof which is expected to be tax deductible) and other identifiable intangible assets of $\n323\n, primarily customer relationships and intellectual property with a weighted-average useful life of approximately\n9\nyears.\nOn July 27, 2022, AspenTech entered into an agreement to acquire Micromine, a global leader in design and operational solutions for the mining industry, for AU $\n900\n(approximately $\n623\nUSD based on exchange rates when the transaction was announced). On August 1, 2023, AspenTech announced the termination of the agreement to purchase Micromine. AspenTech, along with the sellers of Micromine, had been waiting to secure a final Russian regulatory approval as a condition to the closing of the transaction. As this process continued, the timing and requirements necessary to get this approval became increasingly unclear. This lack of clarity on the potential for, and timing of, a successful review led AspenTech and the sellers of Micromine to this mutual course of action. AspenTech did not pay any termination fee as part of this arrangement.\nOn March 31, 2023, Emerson completed the divestiture of Metran, its Russia-based manufacturing subsidiary. In 2023, the Company recognized a pretax loss of $\n47\nin Other deductions ($\n47\nafter-tax, in total\n$\n0.08\nper share)\n50\nrelated to its exit of business operations in Russia. The Company had previously announced its intention to exit business operations in 2022 and recognized a pretax loss of $\n181\n($\n190\nafter-tax, in total $\n0.32\nper share). This charge included a loss of $\n36\nin operations and $\n145\nreported in Other deductions ($\n10\nof which is reported in restructuring costs) and was primarily non-cash. Emerson's historical net sales in Russia represented approximately\n2.0\npercent of consolidated annual sales.\nIn 2022, the Company acquired\nthree\nother businesses,\ntwo\nin the Control Systems & Software segment and\none\nin the AspenTech segment, for $\n130\n, net of cash acquired. The\nthree\nbusinesses had combined annual sales of approximately $\n40\n.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company received a distribution of $\n438\nrelated to its subordinated interest in Vertiv (in total, a pretax gain of $\n453\nwas recognized in the first quarter of 2022, $\n358\nafter-tax, $\n0.60\nper share) and received the remaining $\n15\nrelated to the pretax gain in the first quarter of 2023. In 2023, the Company received additional distributions totaling $\n161\n($\n122\nafter-tax, $\n0.21\nper share) and in 2024, received its final distribution of $\n79\n($\n60\nafter-tax, $\n0.10\nper share).\n(5)\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nOn May 31, 2023, the Company completed the sale of a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the former Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone in a $\n14.0\nbillion transaction. Emerson received upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $\n9.7\nbillion and a note receivable with a face value of $\n2.25\nbillion (which accrues\n5\npercent\ninterest payable in kind by capitalizing interest), while retaining a\n40\npercent\nnon-controlling common equity interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The Climate Technologies business, which includes the Copeland compressor business and the entire portfolio of products and services across all residential and commercial HVAC and refrigeration end-markets, had 2022 net sales of approximately $\n5.0\nbillion and pretax earnings of $\n1.0\nbillion. The Company recognized a pretax gain of approximately $\n10.6\nbillion (approximately $\n8.4\nbillion after-tax including tax expense recognized in prior quarters related to subsidiary restructurings). The new standalone business is named Copeland.\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its\n40\npercent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to private equity funds managed by Blackstone for $\n1.5\nbillion. The transaction closed on August 13, 2024 and the Company recognized a gain of $\n539\n($\n435\nafter-tax) in discontinued operations. In addition, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, have been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are included within Climate Technologies in Other deductions, net in the table below. See Note 8 for further details.\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $\n3.0\nbillion. This business had net sales of $\n630\nand pretax earnings of $\n152\nin 2022. The Company recognized a pretax gain of approximately $\n2.8\nbillion (approximately $\n2.1\nbillion after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023.\nOn May 31, 2022 the Company com\npleted the divestiture of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $\n486\n($\n429\nafter-tax) in the third quarter of 2022.\nThe financial results of Climate Technologies, InSinkErator (\"ISE\") and Therm-O-Disc (\"TOD\") (through the completion of the divestitures), are reported as discontinued operations for all years presented and were as follows:\n51\nClimate Technologies' results for 2024 included a gain on the sale of the Company's\n40\npercent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland of $\n539\n($\n435\nafter-tax), while 2023 include lower expense of $\n96\ndue to ceasing depreciation and amortization upon the held-for-sale classification and $\n57\nof transaction-related costs reported in Other deductions, net. Equity method losses related to the Company's\n40\npercent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland were $\n125\nand $\n177\nfor 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income taxes for 2023 included approximately $\n2.2\nbillion for the gain on the Copeland transaction and subsidiary restructurings, and approximately $\n660\nrelated to the gain on the InSinkErator divestiture.\nNet cash from operating and investing activities for Climate Technologies, InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc were as follows:\nCash from operating activities for 2023 reflects\napproximately $\n2.3\nbillion of income taxes paid related to the gains on the Copeland transaction and InSinkErator divestiture and subsidiary restructurings related to the Copeland transaction. Cash from investing activities for 2024 reflects the proceeds of approximately $\n1.5\nbillion related to the sale of the Company's\n40\npercent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland and $\n1.9\nbillion related to the sale of the note receivable, while 2023 reflects the proceeds of approximately $\n9.7\nbillion related to the Copeland transaction and approximately $\n3.0\nbillion related to the InSinkErator divestiture.\n52\n(6)\nOTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\nIntangibles amortization for 2024 included $\n560\nrelated to the NI acquisition, while 2023 included $\n258\nrelated to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition compared to $\n97\nin 2022. Foreign currency transaction losses included a mark-to-market gain of $\n24\nin 2023 related to foreign currency forward contracts entered into by AspenTech to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated with the Micromine purchase price compared to a mark-to-market loss of $\n50\nin 2022. On June 21, 2023, AspenTech terminated all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. The Company recognized a mark-to-market gain of $\n56\nin 2023 related to its equity investment in National Instruments Corporation (see Note 11 for further information). In 2024, Other includes a loss of $\n48\nrelated to the divestiture of\ntwo\nsmall businesses (see Note 4). Other is also composed of several other items, including pension expense, litigation costs, provision for bad debt and other items, none of which is individually significant.\n(7)\nRESTRUCTURING COSTS\nEach year the Company incurs costs to size its businesses to levels appropriate for current economic conditions and to continually improve its cost structure and operational efficiency, deploy assets globally, and remain competitive on a worldwide basis. Costs result from numerous individual actions implemented across the Company's various operating units on an ongoing basis and can include costs for moving facilities to best-cost locations, restarting plants after relocation or geographic expansion to better serve local markets, reducing headcount or the number of facilities, exiting certain product lines, and other costs resulting from asset deployment decisions (such as contract termination costs, asset write-downs and vacant facility costs).\nRestructuring expenses were $\n228\n, $\n72\nand $\n75\nfor 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company expects fiscal year 2025 restructuring and related costs to be approximately $\n120\n.\nRestructuring costs by business segment follows:\n53\nA\nctions taken in 2024, 2023 and 2022 inc\nluded workforce reductions of approximately\n2,250\n,\n700\nand\n2,150\npositions and the exit of\ntwenty-two\n,\nten\nand\nseven\nproduction facilities and sales offices worldwide, respectively. Corporate restructuring for 2024 includes $\n43\nof integration-related stock compensation expense attributable to NI.\nThe change in the liability for restructuring costs during the years ended September 30 follows:\nThe tables above do not include $\n16\n, $\n20\nand $\n40\nof costs related to restructuring actions incurred in 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively, that are required to be reported in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.\n(8)\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT AND NOTE RECEIVABLE\nAs discussed in Note 5, the Company completed the divestiture of a majority stake in Copeland on May 31, 2023, and received upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $\n9.7\nbillion and a note receivable with a face value of $\n2.25\nbillion, while retaining a\n40\npercent non-controlling common equity intere\nst in Copeland. As a result of the transaction, the Company deconsolidated Copeland from its financial statements, as it no longer had a controlling interest, and initially recognized its common equity investment and note receivable at fair values of $\n1,359\nand $\n2,052\n, respectively.\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell its\n40\npercent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to private equity funds managed by Blackstone for $\n1.5\nbillion and its note receivable to Copeland for $\n1.9\nbillion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. As a result of these transactions, the equity interest and note receivable are reported as held-for-sale in the prior year, and the gain on the sale of the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland and the historical equity method losses, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, have been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 5).\nThe Company recognized non-cash interest income on the note receivable (through the date of the agreement) of $\n86\nand $\n41\nin 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is reported in Interest income from related party within continuing operations and capitalized to the carrying value of the note. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss of $\n279\n($\n217\nafter-tax, $\n0.38\nper share) to adjust the carrying value of the note to $\n1.9\nbillion to reflect the transaction price.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company settled a note receivable and note payable with Copeland of $\n918\n, which is reported in Investing and Financing cash flows, respectively.\nSummarized financial information for Copeland for 2024 and 2023 is presented below. Copeland's results only reflect activity subsequent to the Company's divestiture of its majority stake and through the completion of the sale of the\n40\npercent non-controlling common equity interest.\n54\n(9)\nLEASES\nThe components of lease expense\nfor the years ended September 30 were as follows:\nShort-term lease expense and sublease income were immaterial for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Cash paid for operating leases is classified within operating cash flows from continuing operations and was $\n202\n, $\n170\nand $\n163\nfor the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Operating lease right-of-use asset additions were $\n250\n, $\n247\nand $\n94\nfor the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the balances of the Company's operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and 2024, the vast majority of which relates to offices and manufacturing facilities:\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was\n7.7\nyears and\n6.2\nyears, and the weighted-average discount rate was\n4.4\npercent and\n4.2\npercent as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nFuture maturities of operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 are summarized below:\nLease commitments that have not yet commenced were immaterial as of September 30, 2024.\n55\n(10)\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES\nThe change in the carrying value of goodwill by business segment follows:\nThe gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of identifiable intangible assets by major class follow:\nIntangible asset amortization expense for the major classes included above for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was\n$\n1,366\n, $\n764\nand $\n530\n, respectively. Based on intangible asset balances as of September 30, 2024, amortization expense is expected to approximate\n$\n1,168\nin 2025, $\n1,065\nin 2026, $\n1,030\nin 2027, $\n988\nin 2028 and $\n949\nin 2029. The increase in goodwill and intangible assets in 2024 reflects the National Instruments acquisition.\n56\n(11)\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFollowing is a discussion regarding the Company’s use of financial instruments:\nHedging Activities\nAs of September 30, 2024, the notional amount of foreign currency hedge positions was approximately\n$\n3.3\nbillion. All derivatives receiving hedge accounting are cash flow hedges. The majority of hedging gains and losses deferred as of September 30, 2024 are expected to be recognized over the next 12 months as the underlying forecasted transactions occur. Gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives reported in Other deductions, net reflect hedges of balance sheet exposures that do not receive hedge accounting. Cash flows related to foreign currency hedges are classified within operating cash flows.\nNet Investment Hedge\nIn 2019, the Company issued euro-denominated debt of €\n1.5\nbillion, of which €\n500\nwas repaid in 2024. The outstanding euro notes reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency and have been designated as a hedge of a portion of the investment in these operations. Foreign currency gains or losses associated with the euro-denominated debt are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated. Cash flows related to the euro-denominated debt are classified within financing cash flows.\nThe following gains and losses are included in earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI):\nRegardless of whether derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments receive hedge accounting, the Company expects hedging gains or losses to be offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures. The amounts ultimately recognized will differ from those presented above for open positions, which remain subject to ongoing market price fluctuations until settlement. Derivatives receiving hedge accounting are highly effective and no amounts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nEquity Investment\nThe Company had an equity investment in National Instruments Corporation (\"NI\"), valued at $\n136\nas of September 30, 2023 (reported in Other noncurrent assets), and recognized a mark-to-market gain of $\n56\nin 2023. On April 12, 2023, Emerson announced an agreement to acquire NI for $\n60\nper share in cash for the remaining shares not already owned by Emerson and the transaction closed on October 11, 2023. See Note 4.\nFair Value Measurement\nValuations for all derivatives\nand the Company's long-term debt fall within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy. The fair value of long-term debt was\n$\n7.0\nbillion\nand $\n6.9\nbillion, respec\ntively, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, which was lower than the carrying value by $\n705\nand $\n1,275\n, respectively.\nThe fair values of foreign currency contracts were reported in Other current assets and Accrued expenses as summarized below:\n57\nThe fair value of the Company's equity investment in National Instruments falls within Level 1 and was based on the most recent quoted closing market price from its principal exchange for the period ended September 30, 2023.\n(12)\nSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LINES OF CREDIT\nShort-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt are as follows:\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a\n$\n3.5\nbillion\nfive-year\nrevolving backup credit facility with various banks,\nwhich replaced the May 2018\n$\n3.5\nbillion facility.\nThe credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowings. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities. The credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate alternatives at the Company’s option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial.\n(13)\nLONG-TERM DEBT\nThe details of long-term debt follow:\nLong-term debt maturing during each of the four years after 2025 is $\n562\n, $\n760\n, $\n497\nand $\n998\n, respectively. Total interest paid on long-term debt was approximately $\n193\n, $\n200\nand $\n199\nin 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring the year, the Company repaid $\n529\nof\n0.375\n% euro notes that matured in May 2024. In 2023, the Company repaid $\n500\nof\n2.625\n% notes that matured in February 2023 and AspenTech repaid $\n264\nto pay off the outstanding balance on its existing term loan facility plus accrued interest.\nThe Company maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or\nshare purchase units without a\n58\npredetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale.\n(14)\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS\nRetirement plans expense includes the following components:\nTotal net periodic pension (income) increased in 2024 primarily due to higher return on plan assets, partially offset by higher interest costs. Net periodic pension expense (income) includes $\n7\nand $\n16\nand defined contribution expense includes $\n14\nand $\n32\nfor 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to discontinued operations. For defined contribution plans, the Company makes cash contributions based on plan requirements, which are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company's principal U.S. defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured employees ceased accruing b\nenefits effective October 1, 2016. Effective January 1, 2025, the Company is implementing a new profit sharing retirement program for all U.S. non-union employees. Eligible employees will receive a base contribution to a cash balance account administered within the principal U.S. defined benefit plan, to be funded by surplus pension assets, as well as a potential profit sharing contribution to their defined contribution account. After December 31, 2024, future service for employees that had continued to accrue benefits in the principal U.S. defined benefit plan will be frozen.\n59\nAll of the following tables include defined benefit pension plans related to continuing and discontinued operations.\nDetails of the changes in the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans follow:\nActuarial losses in 2024 were largely due to a decrease in the discount rates used to estimate the benefit obligations for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, which were\n4.97\n% and\n4.7\n% at September 30, 2024 compared to\n6.03\n% and\n5.2\n% at September 30, 2023, respectively. A\nctuarial gains in 2023 were largely due to an increase in the discount rates used to estimate the benefit obligations for the U.S. and non-U.S. p\nlans, which were\n6.03\n% and\n5.2\n% at September 30, 2023 compared to\n5.64\n% and\n4.9\n% at September 30, 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $\n800\nin total, including unfunded plans totaling $\n161\n. The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $\n38\n, including unfunded plans totaling $\n230\n.\nAs of the September 30, 2024 and 2023 measurement dates, the plans' total accumulated benefit obligation was $\n3,942\nand $\n3,719\n, respectively. The total projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for individual plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $\n558\n, $\n470\nand $\n125\n, respectively, for 2024, and $\n519\n, $\n435\nand $\n118\n, respectively, for 2023. The total projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for individual plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $\n515\n, $\n452\nand $\n92\n, respectively, for 2024, and $\n469\n, $\n413\nand $\n77\n, respectively, for 2023.\n60\nFuture benefit payments by U.S. plans are estimated to be $\n272\nin 2025, $\n262\nin 2026, $\n260\nin 2027, $\n255\nin 2028, $\n250\nin 2029 and $\n1,165\nin total over the five years 2030 through 2034. Based on foreign currency exchange rates as of September 30, 2024, future benefit payments by non-U.S. plans are estimated to be $\n63\nin 2025, $\n61\nin 2026, $\n64\nin 2027, $\n68\nin 2028, $\n73\nin 2029 and $\n374\nin total over the five years 2030 through 2034. The Company expects to contribute\napproximately $\n40\nto\nits retirement plans in 2025.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation of pension benefits follow:\nThe discount rate for the U.S. retirement plans was\n4.97\npercent as of September 30, 2024. An actuarially developed, company-specific yield curve is used to determine the discount rate. To determine the service and interest cost components of pension expense for its U.S. retirement plans, the\nCompany applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve, rather than the single weighted-average rate, to the projected cash flows to provide more precise measurement of these costs. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined by reviewing the investment returns of the plans for the past 10 years plus longer-term historical returns of an asset mix approximating the Company's asset allocation targets, and periodically comparing these returns to expectations of investment advisors and actuaries to determine whether long-term future returns are expected to differ significantly from the past.\nThe Company's asset allocations at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and weighted-average target allocations follow:\nThe primary objective for the investment of pension assets is to secure participant retirement benefits by earning a reasonable rate of return. Plan assets are invested consistent with the provisions of the prudence and diversification rules of ERISA and with a long-term investment horizon. The Company continuously monitors the value of assets by class and routinely rebalances to remain within target allocations. The equity strategy is to minimize concentrations of risk by investing primarily in a mix of companies that are diversified across geographies, market capitalization, style, sectors and industries worldwide. The approach for bonds emphasizes investment-grade corporate and government debt with maturities matching the duration of pension liabilities. The bonds strategy also includes a high-yield element which is generally shorter in duration. For diversification, a small portion of U.S. plan assets is allocated to private equity partnerships and real asset fund investments, providing opportunities for above market returns. Leveraging techniques are not used and the use of derivatives in any fund is limited and inconsequential.\nThe fair values of defined benefit pension assets a\ns of September 30, o\nrganized by asset class and by the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement,\nfollow. Investments valued based on the net asset value (NAV) of fund units held, as derived from the fair value of the underlying assets, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy.\n61\nAsset Classes\nU.S. equities reflect companies domiciled in the U.S., including multinational companies. International equities are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S.  Emerging market equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds represent investment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S.  Government bonds include investment-grade instruments issued by federal, state and local governments, primarily in the U.S.  Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds investing in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general investment funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or provide for a small minimum return guarantee.\nFair Value Hierarchy Categories\nValuations of Level 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal exchanges where the individual securities are traded. Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Debt securities categorized as Level 2 assets are generally valued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities having similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prevailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Level 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund investments and insurance arrangements are\nLevel 3. Investments measured at NAV are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collective funds where the underlying securities have observable prices available from active markets and typically provide liquidity daily or within a few days. The NAV category also includes fund investments in private equities, real estate and infrastructure where the fair value of the underlying assets is determined by the investment manager. Total unfunded commitments for the private equity funds were approximately $\n90\nat September 30, 2024. These investments cannot be redeemed, but instead the funds will make distributions through liquidation of the underlying assets, which is expected to occur over approximately the next\n10\nyears. The real estate and infrastructure funds typically offer quarterly redemption.\nPostretirement Plans\nThe Company also sponsors unfunded postretirement benefit plans (primarily health care) for certain U.S. retirees and their dependents. The Company’s principal U.S. postretirement plan has been frozen to new employees since 1993. The postretirement benefit liability\nfor all plans was $\n71\nand $\n72\nas of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and included deferred actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income of $\n68\nand $\n95\n, respectively. Service and interest costs are negligible and more than offset by the amortization of deferred actuarial gains, which resulted in net postretirement income of $\n18\nfor 2024, $\n19\nfor 2023 and $\n12\nfor 2022. Benefits paid\n62\nwere $\n10\nand $\n9\nfor 2024 and 2023, respectively, and the Company estimates that future health care benefit payments will be approximately $\n7\nper year for 2025 through 2029, and $\n27\nin total over the five years 2030 through 2034.\n(15)\nCONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS\nThe Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos) and other matters, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivables. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065. See Note 21 for additional information about the Company's asbestos liabilities and related insurance receivables.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company enters into certain indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business in which the indemnified party is held harmless and is reimbursed for losses incurred from claims by third parties, usually up to a prespecified limit. In connection with divestitures of certain assets or businesses, the Company often provides indemnities to the buyer with respect to certain matters including, for example, environmental or unidentified tax liabilities related to periods prior to the disposition. Because of the uncertain nature of the indemnities, the maximum liability cannot be quantified. As such, contingent liabilities are recorded when they are both probable and reasonably estimable. Historically, payments under indemnity arrangements have been inconsequential.\nAt September 30, 2024, there\nwere\nno\nknown c\nontingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.\n(16)\nINCOME TAXES\nPretax earnings from continuing operations consist of the following:\n63\nThe principal components of income tax expense follow:\nReconciliations of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate follow.\nTest & Measurement purchase accounting reflects a lower tax benefit on inventory step-up amortization. The increase in Other in 2024 includes the losses on\ntwo\nsmall divestitures, which were non-deductible for tax purposes. See Note 4 for further details. The increase in Other in 2023 compared to 2022 was driven by a\n2\npercentage point impact due to an increase in unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company has elected to recognize the tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries as a period expense when it is incurred.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and among other things, provides tax relief to businesses. Tax provisions of the CARES Act included the deferral of certain payroll taxes, relief for retaining employees, and other provisions. The Company deferred $\n73\nof certain payroll taxes through the end of calendar year 2020, of which approximately $\n37\nwas paid in December 2021 and the remainder paid in December 2022.\nNon-U.S. tax holidays reduce tax rates in certain jurisdictions. Approximately\n65\npercent of the tax holidays expire over the next\nthree years\n, with the remainder expiring by 2037.\n64\nFollowing are changes in unrecognized tax benefits before considering recoverability of any cross-jurisdictional tax credits (U.S. federal, state and non-U.S.) and temporary differences. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not expected to change significantly in the next 12 months.\nIf none of the unrecognized tax benefits shown is ultimately paid, the tax provision and the calculation of the effective tax rate would be favorably impacted by $\n246\n, which is net of cross-jurisdictional tax credits and temporary differences. The Company accrues interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense. Total expense (income) recognized was $\n6\n, $\n1\nand $(\n7\n) in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, total accrued interest and penalties were $\n27\nand $\n22\n, respectively.\nThe U.S. is the major jurisdiction for which the Company files income tax returns. Examinations for U.S. federal are complete through 2017, except for 2014. The status of state and non-U.S. tax examinations varies due to the numerous legal entities and jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\nThe principal items that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities follow:\nTotal income taxes paid were appro\nximately $\n950\n, $\n3,310\nand $\n720\nin 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Taxes paid in 2023 included approximately $\n2.3\nbillion related to the gains on the sale of the majority stake in Copeland and the InSinkErator divestiture and subsidiary restructurings related to the Copeland transaction. Taxes related to the Company's sale of its non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland will be paid in 2025. Approximately\n65\nhalf of the $\n283\nof net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely, while most of the remainder expire over the next\n5\nyears.\n(17)\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company's stock-based compensation plans include performance shares, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock options. Although the Company has discretion, shares distributed under these plans are issued from treasury stock.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company changed the terms of its annual performance share awards that were issued in the first quarter. The terms meet the criteria for equity classification in accordance with ASC 718,\nCompensation - Stock Compensation\n, and therefore expense is recognized on a fixed basis over the\nthree-year\nperformance period.\nAspenTech also has stock-based compensation plans that are settled in its own stock. These plans consist of performance shares, restricted stock units and stock options.\nAs a result of the Company's acquisition of NI, outstanding NI restricted stock units and performance stock units were assumed by Emerson and converted at the time of the acquisition into Emerson time-based restricted stock units, but otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and payment schedule) as the awards originally issued by NI.\nTotal compensation expense and income tax benefits for Emerson and AspenTech stock options and incentive shares follows.\nStock compensation expense for 2024 includes $\n96\nrelated to NI restricted stock units, which includes\n$\n58\nof integration-related stock compensation expense (of which\n$\n43\nwas reported as restructuring costs).\nAs of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested shares awarded under Emerson plans was $\n190\n, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.1\nyears, while the total future unrecognized compensation cost related to AspenTech stock options, RSUs and performance stock un\nits was $\n8\n, $\n63\nand $\n23\nrespectively, which is expected to be recorded over a weighted average period of\n2.2 years,\n2.2\nyears and\n2.6\nyears, respectively.\nEmerson Performance Shares, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nThe Company's incentive shares plans include performance shares awards which distribute the value of common stock to key management employees at the conclusion of a\nthree-year\nperiod subject to certain operating performance conditions and other terms and restrictions. Dividend equivalents are only paid on earned awards after the performance period has concluded. Compensation expense for performance shares is recognized over the service period based on the number of shares ultimately expected to be earned.\nInformation related to performance share payouts for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 follows (shares in thousands):\n66\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately\n919,000\nshares awarded primarily in 2022 were outstanding, contingent on the Company achieving its performance objectives through 2024. The objectives for these shares were met at t\nhe\n118\npercent\nlevel and the shares will be distributed in early fiscal 2025.\nAdditionally, the rights to receive approximately\n518,000\nand\n928,000\nshares awarded in 2024 and 2023, respectively, are outstanding and contingent upon the Company achieving its performance objectives through 2026 and 2025, respectively.\nIncentive shares plans also include restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards involve distribution of common stock to key management employees subject to cliff vesting at the end of service periods ranging from\nthree\nto\nten years\nwhile restricted stock units granted to employees vest over a\nthree-year\nperiod. The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the average of the high and low market prices of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, with compensation expense recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period. In 2024, approximately\n55,000\nshares of restricted stock and approximately\n1,462,000\nrestricted stock units vested as a result of participants fulfilling the applicable service requirements. Consequently, approximately\n38,000\nshares and\n1,404,000\nunits were issued while\n17,000\nshares and\n58,000\nunits were withheld for income taxes in accordance with minimum withholding requirements. As of September 30, 2024, there were approximately\n2,269,000\nshares of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding.\nIn addition to the employee stock option and incentive share plans, in 2024 the Company awarded approximately\n19,000\nrestricted stock units under the restricted stock plan for non-management directors. As of September 30, 2024, approximately\n38,000\nshares were available for issuance under this plan.\nAs of September 30, 2024,\n17.5\nmillion\nshares remained available for award under incentive shares plans.\nChanges in shares outstanding but not yet earned under incentive shares plans during the year ended September 30, 2024 follow (shares in thousands; assumes 100 percent payout of unvested awards):\nInformation related to Emerson incentive shares plans follows:\nEmerson Stock Options\nThere were\nno\nstock option grants in 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Company's stock option plans expired in 2021. Previously awarded stock options allow key officers and employees to purchase common stock at specified prices, which are equal to\n100\npercent of the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Options generally vest\none-third\nin each of the\nthree years\nsubsequent to grant and expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant.\n67\nChanges in shares subject to options during the year ended September 30, 2024 follow (shares in thousands):\nInformation related to Emerson stock options follows:\nAspenTech Stock-Based Compensation\nAs discussed in Note 4, Emerson completed the acquisition of Heritage AspenTech in the third quarter of 2022. AspenTech, as defined in Note 4, operates as a separate publicly traded company and has various stock-based compensation plans, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units, which are settled in their own common stock and are accounted for as equity awards. Restricted stock units and performance stock units generally vest over\nthree years\n. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, the Company granted performance stock units with both a performance and service condition. The performance condition relates to the attainment of predefined goals based on annual contract value and free cash flows. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the probability that the threshold performance goals will be achieved, if at all, and the anticipated level of attainment to determine the amount of compensation expense to record in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Option awards have been granted with an exercise price equal to the market closing price of AspenTech's stock on the trading day prior to the grant date. These options generally vest over\nfour years\nand expire within\nseven years\nor\nten years\nof grant. AspenTech's policy is to issue new shares upon the exercise of vested stock awards.\nPursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement between Emerson and Heritage AspenTech, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock, whether vested or unvested, that was unexercised as of immediately prior to the closing date was converted into an option to acquire shares of AspenTech. Each converted option is subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original option. In addition, each outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock that were unvested as of immediately prior to the closing date was converted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of AspenTech. Each converted restricted stock unit is also subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original restricted stock unit.\nASC 805 required the Company to determine the fair value of the AspenTech share-based payment awards related to the replacement of the Heritage AspenTech share-based payment awards, and allocate the total fair value based on the services that are attributable to the pre- and post-combination service periods, respectively. The portion that is attributable to the pre-combination service period was considered part of the consideration transferred for Heritage AspenTech and included as part of the purchase price. The portion that is attributable to the post-combination service period is recognized as stock-based compensation expense in the post-combination consolidated financial statements over the remaining requisite service period.\nAspenTech Stock Options\nAspenTech utilizes the Black-Scholes option valuation model for estimating the fair value of options granted. The Black-Scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions regarding expected stock price volatility, the expected life of the option, the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and the market value of AspenTech's common stock. The expected stock price volatility is determined based on AspenTech's stock’s historic prices over a period commensurate with the expected life of the award. The expected life of an option represents the period for which options are expected to be outstanding as determined by historic option exercises and cancellations. The risk-free\n68\ninterest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for notes with terms approximating the expected life of the options g\nranted. The expected dividend yield is\nzero\n, based on AspenTech's history and expectation of not paying dividends on common shares. Stoc\nk-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of forfeitures as they occur, over the requisite service period for time-vested awards. There were\nno\nstock option grants in 2024.\nA summary of AspenTech stock option activity in 2024 is as follows (shares in thousands):\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2024 was $\n15\n. Cash proceeds of $\n25\nfrom issuances of shares of AspenTech common stock were received during 2024.\nAspenTech Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units\nA summary of AspenTech restricted stock unit and performance stock unit activity in 2024 is as follows (shares in thousands):\nIn\n2024\n, AspenTech granted additional performance stock units with a performance condition and service\ncondition. The 2024 performance stock units vest on a cliff basis in three years based upon the achievement of predefined performance goals, with no ability for the awards to vest on an accelerated basis. The performance goal relates to (i) growth in annual contract value over the performance period and (ii) cumulative free cash flow over the performance period. Up to\n150\npercent of the performance stock units could vest upon achievement of the performance goals. Conversely, if a minimum performance goal is not met, none of the performance stock units will vest.\nDuring 2024, the total fair value of vested shares from AspenTech RSU grants amounted to $\n62\n. Withholding taxes of $\n21\nwere paid on vested RSUs during 2024.\nOn a quarterly basis, management evaluates the probability that the threshold performance goals will be achieved, if at all, and the anticipated level of attainment to determine the amount of compensation expense to record in the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2023, AspenTech granted performance stock units with a performance condition and service condition. These performance stock units vest on a cliff basis in\nthree years\nbased upon the achievement of predefined performance goals, with the ability for\n25\npercent of granted awards to vest on an accelerated basis in each of the first two years. The performance goal relates to the sum of (i) annual contract value growth and (ii) free cash flow margin over the\n69\nperformance period. Up to\n175\npercent of the performance stock units could vest upon achievement of the performance goals. Conversely, if a minimum performance goal is not met, none of the performance stock units will vest.\nAt September 30, 2024, common stock reserved for future issuance under all AspenTech equity compensation plans was\n4\nmillion shares.\n(18)\nCOMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK\nAt September 30, 2024,\n23.3\nmillion shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the Company's stock-based compensation plans. During 2024,\n4.4\nmillion common shares were purchased and\n2.6\nmillion treasury shares were reissued. In 2023,\n21.3\nmillion common shares were purchased and\n1.8\nmillion treasury shares were reissued.\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had\n5.4\nmillion shares of $\n2.50\npar value preferred stock authorized, with\nnone\nissued.\n(19)\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\n(20)\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nINFORMATION\nAs a result of the Company's acquisition of NI, which is now referred to as Test & Measurement and reported as a new segment in the Software and Control business group (see Note 4),\nthe Company now reports\nseven\nsegments and\ntwo\nbusiness groups, which are highlighted in the table below.\n70\nThe\nFinal Control\nsegment is a leading global provider of control valves, isolation valves, shutoff valves, pressure relief valves, pressure safety valves, actuators, and regulators for process and hybrid industries.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is\nresponsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\n76\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate beca\nuse of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicat\ned or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence over Net Sales\nAs discussed in Notes 1, 2 and 20 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and disclosed in the consolidated statement of earnings, the Company recorded $17.5 billion of net sales in 2024.\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales as a critical audit matter. Net sales are recognized primarily from the sale of tangible products from hundreds of Company locations around the world. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required especially subjective auditor judgment because of the geographical dispersion of the Company’s net sales generating activities. This included determining the Company locations at which procedures were performed and the supervision and review of procedures performed at those locations.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over net sales, including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. At each Company location where procedures were performed, we:\n•\nEvaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s net sales processes, including the Company’s controls over the accurate recording of amounts.\n•\nAssessed the recorded net sales by selecting a sample of transactions and compared the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers and shipping documentation.\nEvaluation of the Acquisition Date Fair Value of Certain Acquired Intangible Assets\nAs discussed in Notes 4 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, on October 11, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of National Instruments Corporation for a total purchase consideration of $8.7 billion. The estimated intangible assets attributable to the transactions included customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets with acquisition date fair values of $3.36 billion and $1.57 billion, respectively.\nWe identified the evaluation of the acquisition date fair value of the customer relationships and developed     technology intangible assets as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective and complex auditor judgment was required to evaluate key assumptions used to value these acquired intangible assets. Specifically, key assumptions included projected revenue and customer attrition for the customer relationships intangible asset and projected revenue and obsolescence rates for the developed technology intangible asset. Changes to these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the fair value of such assets. In addition,\n77\nvaluation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were needed to assist in the evaluation of the customer attrition and obsolescence rates assumptions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s business combination process, including controls related to the development of the projected revenue, customer attrition, and obsolescence rate assumptions used in the Company’s valuations of intangible assets. We evaluated the projected revenue used by the Company by (1) comparing to historical results of the acquired entity and publicly available information for peer companies and (2) inquiring of individuals outside of the accounting function about projected revenue and the process used to develop it. In addition, we compared the Company’s projected revenue for the acquired entity to their actual revenue subsequent to the acquisition to evaluate the C\nompany’s ability to forecast. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n•\nevaluating the Company's customer attrition rate by comparing it to historical attrition experienced by the acquired company\n•\nevaluating the obsolescence rates by comparing them to companies within the same industry as well as comparable historical transactions\nWe or our predecessor firms have served as the Company’s auditor since 1938.\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 12, 2024\n78"
