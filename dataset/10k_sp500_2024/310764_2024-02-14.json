We offer innovative products and services in MedSurg, Neurotechnology, Orthopaedics and Spine that help improve patient and healthcare outcomes. Alongside our customers around the world, we impact more than 150 million patients annually.\nOur core values guide our behaviors and actions and are fundamental to how we execute our mission.\nStryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a prominent orthopaedic surgeon and inventor of several medical products. Our products are sold in approximately 75 countries through company-owned subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors, and include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products; clinical communication and workflow solutions; neurosurgical and neurovascular devices; implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted technology; spinal devices; as well as other products used in a variety of medical specialties. Most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities.\nAs used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, \"Stryker,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" refer to Stryker Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nBusiness Segments and Geographic Information\nWe segregate our operations into two reportable business segments: (i) MedSurg and Neurotechnology and (ii) Orthopaedics and Spine. Financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information is included under \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" in Item 7 of this report and Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology\nMedSurg products include surgical equipment, patient and caregiver safety technologies, and navigation systems (Instruments), endoscopic and communications systems and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices (Endoscopy), and patient handling, emergency medical equipment, intensive care disposable products and clinical communication and workflow solutions (Medical). Neurotechnology includes neurosurgical, neurovascular and craniomaxillofacial implant products. Our neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular procedures; a comprehensive line of products for traditional brain and open skull based surgical procedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products (Neuro Cranial); and minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (Neurovascular). The craniomaxillofacial implant offering includes cranial, maxillofacial and chest wall devices as well as dural substitutes and sealants.\nWe are one of five leading global competitors in Instruments; the other four being Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), Medtronic plc (Medtronic), Johnson & Johnson and ConMed Linvatec, Inc. (a subsidiary of CONMED Corporation). We are one of seven leading global competitors in Endoscopy; the other six being Karl Storz GmbH & Co., Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Smith & Nephew plc (Smith & Nephew), ConMed Linvatec, Arthrex, Inc. and STERIS plc. We are one of five leading global competitors in Medical; the other four being Baxter International Inc., Zoll Medical Corporation, Medline Industries and Ferno-Washington, Inc. We are one of five leading global competitors in Neurotechnology; the other four being Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, Terumo Corporation and Penumbra, Inc.\nIn 2023 Instruments launched the Neptune S, which is the only constantly closed low-fluid waste management system on the market. Instruments also saw continued momentum from the launch of the System 9 total joint power tool.\nEndoscopy expanded its product offering with the launch of the 4K 1788 Camera platform that features several enhancements for a broader range of clinical applications and specialties, including urology, neurology and ear, nose and throat. In addition, 1788 can be used to visualize indocyanine green and Cytalux.\nMedical launched the Xpedition powered stair chair, designed with an integrated workflow for first responders, maintaining the same storage footprint as Stryker's Stair-PRO and enhanced user interface for ease of use. Xpedition allows caregivers to safely and ergonomically move patients over a variety of terrains.\nNeurovascular completed the acquisition of Cerus Endovascular Limited (Cerus), a leader in the design and development of neurointerventional devices for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The acquisition of Cerus is highly complementary to our Neurovascular business and strengthens our hemorrhagic portfolio globally. Neurovascular also launched the Target Tetra coil in the United States, Japan, Korea and Europe, Middle East, Africa for the treatment of small aneurysms and the Vecta 46 Intermediate Catheter in the United States, Japan and Korea.\nOrthopaedics and Spine\nOrthopaedics products consist primarily of implants used in total joint replacements, such as hip, knee and shoulder, and trauma and extremities surgeries. We bring patients and physicians advanced implant designs and specialized instrumentation that make orthopaedic surgery and recovery simpler, faster and more effective. We support surgeons with the technology and services they need as they develop new surgical techniques. The Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgical System was designed to help surgeons provide patients with a personalized surgical experience based on their specific diagnosis and anatomy. The Mako System currently offers three applications supporting Partial Knee, Total Hip and Total Knee procedures. Mako is the only robotic-arm assisted technology enabled by 3D CT-based pre-operative planning and, with AccuStop™ haptic technology, Mako provides surgeons the ability to know more about their patients' anatomy so they can cut less in bone preparation and implant placement with intra-operative haptic guidance.\nOur spinal implant offering includes cervical and thoracolumbar systems that include fixation, minimally invasive and interbody systems used in spinal injury, complex spine and degenerative therapies. Our spine enabling technologies portfolio includes best in class imaging solutions, image-guided surgical technology, patient specific implants and digital health solutions supporting surgeons and their patients throughout the continuum of care.\nWe are one of four leading global competitors for joint replacement and trauma and extremities products and robotics; the other three being Zimmer, DePuy Synthes (a Johnson & Johnson company) and Smith & Nephew. We are one of four leading global competitors in Spine; the other three being Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic), Globus Medical, Inc. (including Nuvasive) and DePuy Synthes.\nIn 2023 we continued our full commercial launch of the Insignia hip stem. Insignia received approval in Japan from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency and clinical cases occurred in December 2023. With the addition of Japan, Insignia is now being used clinically in six countries worldwide (United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong). We also saw our first clinical use of the Triathlon Hinge revision knee system in August 2023. The Hinge product helps restore patient mobility in challenging cases and we anticipate moving towards full commercial launch in 2024. In 2023 we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate. Since its introduction in 2013, Triathlon Cementless, which includes the Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate, has delivered a decade of positive patient impact, demonstrated impressive survivorship data and has become a trusted solution for surgeons across the globe.\nIn 2023 we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the Mako Surgical Corp. acquisition and the Mako SmartRobotics™ technology. Over the past ten years, this groundbreaking technology has transformed the orthopaedics landscape, resulting in tremendous patient impact for surgeons and their patients. Additionally, we reached the milestone of 1 million Mako SmartRobotics™ procedures performed globally.\nRaw Materials and Inventory\nRaw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources; however, certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers. Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order.\nPatents and Trademarks\nPatents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process. Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features. We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage. On December 31, 2023 we owned approximately 5,200 United States patents and approximately 7,700 patents in other countries.\nSeasonality\nOur business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months, and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.\nCompetition\nIn each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies. The development of innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business. Competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces.\nWe believe our commitment to innovation, quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively. We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.\nRegulation\nOur businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. We are required to comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each country in which we market and sell our products.\nIn the United States the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for federal regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products. In addition, state licensing requirements often apply to certain of our business operations and products. On the federal level, many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them. Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval applications for specific surgical indications. Certain of our products also fall under other FDA classifications, such as drugs and Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products.\nThe FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of\nstate, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.\nThe European Union enacted the European Union Medical Device Regulation in May 2017 with an original effective date of May 2021, which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems, labeling and post-market surveillance. Extended transition timelines were published in 2023 which range from May 2026 through December 2028 depending on the type of device and our implementation is on track to meet these timelines.\nInitiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets we do business. These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing. It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business. In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized, particularly in the United States, by federal and state government agencies. The resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nEnvironment\nWe are subject to various rules and regulation in the United States and internationally related to the protection of human health and the environment. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to comply, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property, plant and equipment, cash flows, net earnings or competitive position.\nEmployees\nOn December 31, 2023 we had approximately 52,000 employees globally, with approximately 27,000 employees in the United States. Our talented employees are an integral reason for our standing as a global leader in medical technologies where, together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better. Our company values of integrity, accountability, people and performance are a key component of that mission. Our people, as one of our core values, continue to be a key focus.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract the best talent. To do so, we continue to focus on creating and maintaining a great workplace. We believe in attracting the right people, maintaining and building employee engagement and developing our employees. We believe when people are able to do what they do best, they will look forward to coming to work and, in turn, will deliver great business results.\nOur leadership team and Board of Directors receive regular updates on our people and culture strategy and provide feedback on our strategy and goals, including alignment to our mission and values, peer benchmarking and stakeholder feedback.\nEmployee Development\nOur employee development is extensive and exists at all levels of the organization, including company-wide training on our Code of Conduct, job-related technical training and management and leadership training. Our development programs include on-the-job learning, coaching and mentoring, management and leadership development courses, team building and collaboration training and immersive experiences with expert partners.\nWe encourage all employees to establish development objectives, in partnership with their manager, to help employees gain the needed development experience to grow their careers.\nEmployee Engagement\nAn engaged workplace culture that drives performance and business outcomes is central to our mission. Listening to and learning from our employees forms the foundation of an engaging culture. More than 90% of our employees participate in our annual engagement survey, which provides a valued platform for listening and allows us to take action based on the feedback collected.\nWe supplement our annual engagement survey with targeted pulse surveys to gather feedback on topics relevant to the current climate. In addition, we establish forums for collecting qualitative feedback to gain insights and identify actions we can take so that employees feel included, engaged and able to achieve their full potential.\nWe also provide tools and resources that enable managers and teams to act on the insights we gain from our surveys and to drive employee engagement and strong business outcomes.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)\nAn essential part of our culture is respecting each individual’s strengths and values. Building on this foundation, we are focused on maintaining an inclusive, engaging work environment and prioritizing DE&I in keeping with our values of integrity and people. Our DE&I strategy is centered around these three commitments:\n•\nStrengthen the diversity of our workforce\n•\nAdvance a culture of inclusion, engagement and belonging\n•\nMaximize the power of inclusion to drive innovation and growth\nWe are advancing our commitments through the following actions, among others:\n•\nIncreasing access to talent through strategic partnerships and campaigns\n•\nGrowing and engaging talent with a range of opportunities to learn and develop\n•\nAligning our employee resource groups to focus on creating community and belonging\nAs of December 31, 2023 approximately 38.1% of our employees were women and 27.9% of our employees in the United States identified as racially or ethnically diverse.\nAttracting and Hiring\nWe understand that every employee drives our success. We focus on attracting, identifying and selecting strong candidates who will be successful at Stryker and ensuring that each person we hire brings the talent, expertise and passion we need to continue to be successful.\nHealth and Safety\nEnsuring our employees' safety is a top priority. It is a responsibility that we share throughout the company and one that has evolved to meet the needs of our workforce. Employees' safety risks vary depending on the roles they perform, so we tailor our safety efforts accordingly.\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract and retain top talent and to incentivize performance and alignment to our mission and values.\nWe offer market-competitive base pay and benefits to our employees in countries around the world. We regularly evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings and levels, using recognized outside consulting firms to ensure internal fairness and competitiveness in our offerings.\nMost of our employees also have variable components to their compensation packages that reward employees based on individual, business unit and/or company-wide performance.\nOur proxy statement provides more detail on the competitive compensation programs we offer.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nEach of our executive officers was elected by our Board of Directors to serve in the office indicated until the first meeting of the Board of Directors following the annual meeting of shareholders in 2024 or until a successor is chosen and qualified or until his or her resignation or removal. Each of our executive officers held the position above or served Stryker in various executive or administrative capacities for at least five years, except for Mr. Fletcher. Prior to joining Stryker in April 2019, Mr. Fletcher held various legal leadership roles with Johnson & Johnson for the previous 14 years, most recently as the Worldwide Vice President, Litigation.\nAvailable Information\nOur main corporate website address is\nwww.stryker.com.\nThe information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. Copies of our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available free of charge on our website within the \"Investors Relations\" section as soon as reasonably practicable after having been electronically filed or furnished to the SEC.

    "text": "This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity. Words that identify forward-looking statements include, without limitation, words such as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"possible,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"forecast,\" \"potential,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"may impact,\" \"on track,\" \"goal,\" \"strategy\" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any\nunderlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements, historical experience or our present expectations. Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include:\n•\nweakening of economic conditions, or the anticipation thereof, that could adversely affect the level of demand for our products;\n•\ngeopolitical risks, including from international conflicts and upcoming elections in the United States and other countries, which could, among other things, lead to increased market volatility;\n•\npricing pressures generally, including cost-containment measures that could adversely affect the price of or demand for our products;\n•\nchanges in foreign currency exchange markets;\n•\nlegislative and regulatory actions;\n•\nunanticipated issues arising in connection with clinical studies and otherwise that affect approval of new products by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies;\n•\ninflationary pressures;\n•\nincreased interest rates or interest rate volatility;\n•\nsupply chain disruptions;\n•\nchanges in labor markets;\n•\nchanges in reimbursement levels from third-party payors;\n•\na significant increase in product liability claims;\n•\nthe ultimate total cost with respect to recall-related and other regulatory and quality matters;\n•\nthe impact of investigative and legal proceedings and compliance risks;\n•\nresolution of tax audits;\n•\nchanges in tax laws and regulations;\n•\nthe impact of legislation to reform the healthcare system in the United States or other countries;\n•\ncosts to comply with medical device regulations;\n•\nchanges in financial markets;\n•\nchanges in our credit ratings;\n•\nchanges in the competitive environment;\n•\nour ability to integrate and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions in full or at all or within the expected timeframes;\n•\nour ability to realize anticipated cost savings;\n•\npotential negative impacts resulting from climate change or other environmental, social and governance and sustainability related matters;\n•\nthe impact on our operations and financial results of any public health emergency and any related policies and actions by governments or other third parties;\n•\nbreaches or failures of our or our vendors’ or customers’ information technology systems or products, including by cyber-attack, data leakage, unauthorized access or theft; and\n•\nother risks detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nWhile we believe that the assumptions underlying such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that future events or developments will not cause such statements to be inaccurate. All forward-looking statements\ncontained in this report are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. We expressly disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which those expectations may be based, or that affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material or that could apply to any company may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the risks discussed below or other risks actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this report.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe use a variety of raw materials, components, devices and third-party services in our global supply chains, production and distribution processes; significant shortages, price increases or unavailability of third-party services have in the past increased, and could in the future increase, our operating costs and could require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the competitive position of our products:\nOur reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials, components and finished devices, and on certain third-party service providers, such as sterilization service providers, exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices, whether due to inflationary pressure, regulatory changes, litigation exposure, geopolitical tensions or otherwise. For example, in the past we experienced limited product availability due to an electronic components shortage in certain product lines. If a similar shortage occurs in the future with respect to other raw materials or components, we may not be able to obtain them from our suppliers on a timely basis, or at all, or identify alternative suppliers. In addition, several raw materials, components, finished devices and services are procured from a sole source due to the quality considerations, unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements. If sole-source suppliers or service providers are unable or unwilling to deliver these materials or services as a result of financial difficulties, acquisition by a third party, natural disasters or otherwise, we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer. In certain cases, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or service providers for such services in a timely or cost-effective manner, often as a result of FDA and other regulations that require, among other things, validation of materials, components and services prior to their use in or with our products. In certain instances we have been unable to meet demand due to supply chain challenges, which has led to loss of sales. Although the impacts have not been material to date, an inability to meet demand due to supply chain challenges in the future could materially adversely impact our reputation, the competitive position of our products and our business. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.\nIn addition, since 2022 the market has experienced increasing inflationary pressures in part due to global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and other impacts following the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect these inflationary pressures will continue. Inflation in the United States and in many of the countries where we conduct business has resulted in, and may\ncontinue to result in, higher interest rates and increased capital, energy, shipping and labor costs, weakening or strengthening exchange rates against the United States Dollar and other similar effects. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, inflationary increases in manufacturing costs and operating expenses, as well as negative impacts from weakening or strengthening exchange rates against the United States Dollar. Although we have been able to pass certain cost increases on to our customers, we have not been able to pass along all cost increases and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. Inflation, higher interest rates or interest rate volatility may also cause our customers to reduce or delay orders for our products and services. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our sales, profitability and results of operations.\nWe are subject to pricing pressures as a result of cost containment measures in the United States and other countries and other factors:\nInitiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business. These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing. For example, China has implemented a volume-based procurement process designed to decrease prices for medical devices and other products. This has already impacted our joint replacement and spine businesses on a national level, and our trauma and certain neurovascular products on a provincial level, and we expect further adoption of volume-based procurement provincially or nationally in China in 2024. Pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally. We have also reduced prices for certain products due to increased competition and if we further reduce prices, we could become less profitable. In addition, due to healthcare industry consolidation in recent years, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants has become, and may continue to become, more intense, and this consolidation has produced, and may continue to produce, larger enterprises with more bargaining power. Pricing pressures related to any of the foregoing or other factors have impacted and could in the future impact our results of operations and profitability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant:\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development. New business models, products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by internal or external technological advances, as we continue to innovate to address physician and patient needs, or by our existing competitors and new market entrants. Our existing competitors and new market entrants may respond more quickly to or integrate new or emerging technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning in their product offerings, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater access to clinical information to support ongoing product position in the market, have greater financial, marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.\nThere can be no assurance that any products now in development, or that we may seek to develop in the future, will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to develop and launch\nnew products, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be negatively impacted.\nWe may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals:\nWe seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in healthcare organizations, such as hospitals and universities, who assist in product research and development. We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products. If we are unable to maintain these relationships due to regulatory restrictions, hospital access restrictions for non-patients or for other reasons, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could be adversely affected. For example, China's National Health Commission has launched an anti-corruption campaign focused on investigating government officials and individuals employed by state-owned entities and public institutions in the healthcare sector, which has resulted in us seeing some limitations to physician and surgeon access. Although this has not had a material impact on our business, if other jurisdictions were to take this approach, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that are independent of Stryker:\nIn many markets we rely on indirect distribution channels to market, distribute and sell our products. These indirect channels often are the main point of contact for the healthcare professionals and healthcare organization customers who buy and use our products. Our ability to continue to market, distribute and sell our products may be at risk if the indirect channels become insolvent, choose to sell competitive products, choose to stop selling medical technology, fail to adhere to Stryker requirements or are subject to new or additional government regulation.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our extensive global operations:\nWe develop, manufacture and distribute our products globally. Our global operations are subject to risks and costs related to, among other things, changes in reimbursement; changes in regulatory requirements (such as the staggered phase-in period for manufacturers to comply with the European Union Medical Device Regulation (MDR) through December 2028); differing local product preferences and product requirements; diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; tariffs and other trade protection measures, as well as increasing localization and protectionism policies in certain jurisdictions; international trade disputes and import or export requirements; difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations; introduction of new internal business structures and programs; political and economic instability; current or potential geopolitical conflicts, such as the tensions between China and Taiwan and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and related sanctions and other developments; disruptions of transportation, including port closures, increased border controls or border closures or reduced transportation availability, due to military conflicts, a global pandemic of contagious diseases like COVID-19 or otherwise; increased energy or transportation costs; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and financial markets; and increased security threats to our supply chain. Many of these risks are rapidly evolving and subject to an accelerating pace of change. Our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations in an increasingly volatile environment. In addition, in many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to us or our industry are evolving, and we have in certain cases become subject to divergent and conflicting laws and regulations across our operations, which could increase risk over time.\nWe may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions:\nIn addition to internally developed products, we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions,\nincluding our acquisition of Cerus in 2023. Such investments are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us. The risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses, diversion of management time that could adversely affect management’s ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel, litigation resulting from the acquisition and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies. Certain acquisitions are subject to antitrust and competition laws, and antitrust scrutiny by regulatory agencies and changes to the regulatory approval process in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated to obtain, not be obtained at all, or contain burdensome conditions, which may jeopardize, delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of acquisitions to us and could impede the execution of our business strategy. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable.\nWe, our business partners or our third-party vendors could experience a material failure or breach of a key information technology system, network, process or site:\nWe rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business. In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, cloud and software-as-a-service solutions, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software (including open-source software) and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats have posed, and will continue to pose, risks to the security of our IT systems, networks and product offerings, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Some of our products and services, and information technology systems, contain or use open-source software, which poses particular risks, including potential security vulnerabilities, licensing compliance issues and quality issues. We, our customers and third-party hosting services have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, security breaches of, or unauthorized access to, products or systems. While such breaches or unauthorized access have not been material to date, we cannot guarantee that any future breach or unauthorized access will not be material and any breach or unauthorized access could impact the use of such products and systems and the security of information stored therein. Although we have made investments and expect to continue to make investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, use of artificial intelligence, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures.\nWhen cybersecurity incidents occur, we follow our incident response protocols and address them in accordance with applicable governmental regulations and other legal requirements. Our response to these incidents and our investments to protect our product offerings and information technology infrastructure and data may not shield us from significant losses and potential liability or prevent any future interruption or breach of our systems. Moreover, given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used by threat actors to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems, a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and we may not anticipate these acts or mitigate them adequately or timely, which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated. The extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may\nnot be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known. New regulations may require us to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident before it has been resolved or fully investigated. Additionally, as threats continue to evolve and increase, and as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities, which could adversely impact our net income. In addition, a significant number of our employees working remotely has exposed us, and may continue to expose us, to greater risks related to cybersecurity and cyber-liability. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches or unauthorized access and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.\nAn inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new commercial global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could adversely affect our operations and operating results:\nWe are in the process of implementing a new commercial ERP system. This system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems. The implementation is a major undertaking, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Any material disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.\nWe may be unable to attract, develop and retain executives and key employees:\nOur sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products. Our future performance also depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management. If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force in our highly competitive industry, or if we are unable to plan effective succession for the future, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives. Inflationary pressures, labor demand and shortages and other macroeconomic factors have increased and could further increase the cost of labor and could harm our ability to recruit, hire and retain talented employees. In addition, increased unionization could negatively impact our labor costs and ability to create an engaging, connected culture, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive workforce. Further, if we are unable to maintain competitive and equitable compensation and benefit programs, including incentive programs which reward financial and operational performance, our ability to recruit, hire, engage, motivate and retain talent could be negatively affected. Additionally, if we are unable to maintain an inclusive culture that aligns our diverse workforce with our mission and values, it could adversely impact our ability to recruit, hire, develop and retain key talent. Further, our remote and hybrid work practices, ability to provide flexible and alternative work arrangements, and our practices relating to corporate responsibility may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees, including senior management or other key employees, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees, or may harm our culture and/or decrease employee engagement,\nwhich could adversely impact our ability to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive workforce.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and other key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel, could harm our business. Our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons timely. In addition, recent legal and regulatory changes affect our ability to enforce post-termination obligations from certain employees with respect to non-competition, non-solicitation and protection of confidential information. This may negatively impact our ability to retain employees and protect our information and relationships with customers and other third parties.\nInterruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business:\nWe and our suppliers have manufacturing and supply sites all over the world. However, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants or geographic regions. We have principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington, and outside the United States in China, France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and Turkey. Damage to our facilities, to our suppliers’ or service providers’ facilities, or to our central distribution centers as a result of natural disasters, fires, explosions or otherwise, as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation, equipment breakdown or malfunction, IT system failures or cybersecurity incidents, environmental hazard incidents or changes to environmental regulations or other factors, could adversely affect the availability of our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing and distributing affected products to meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production or distribution of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals, and we may experience loss of market share, additional expense and harm to our reputation.\nOur insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses:\nWe maintain third-party insurance to cover our exposure to certain property and casualty losses and are self-insured for claims and expenses related to other property and casualty losses, including product liability, intellectual property infringement and enforcement, environmental, and cybersecurity and data privacy losses. We manage a portion of our exposure to self-insured losses through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. Insurance coverage limits provided by third-party insurers and/or our captive insurance company may not be sufficient to fully cover certain losses we may experience.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, a significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations as market demand for certain of our products has shifted and continues to shift or as may be mandated by governmental authorities:\nSome of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures. Elective medical procedures were suspended or reduced at various times during the COVID-19 pandemic in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold, which negatively affected\nour business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. It is not possible to predict whether elective medical procedures will again be suspended or reduced in the future and, to the extent individuals and customers are required to delay or cancel elective procedures, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected. Further, our customers have experienced, and could continue to experience, staffing shortages that may result in decreased demand for our products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic our products in certain divisions, such as Medical, experienced higher demand as our customers were focused on treating COVID-19 patients and preparing for future public health emergencies. Unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products have exceeded in the past, and could exceed in the future, our capacity to meet such demand timely, which could adversely affect our customer relationships and result in negative publicity. In this regard, the accelerated development and production of products and services to address medical and other requirements could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or related claims or reputational harm.\nPandemics and public health emergencies, and the fear thereof, have in the past materially adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect, our operations, supply chain, manufacturing, product distribution, customers and other business activities:\nIn connection with COVID-19, governmental authorities and private enterprises implemented, and may in the future implement in connection with another pandemic or public health emergency (or in response to the fear thereof), measures, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. Our customers, global suppliers, distributors and manufacturing facilities have in the past been, and could in the future be, materially affected by restrictive measures implemented in response to a pandemic or public health emergency, which has in the past caused and could in the future cause them to be unable to hire and retain employees, distribute or use our products or provide required services. We have as a result experienced, and could in the future experience, delays in, or the suspension of, our manufacturing operations, sales activities, research and product development activities, regulatory work streams, clinical development programs and other important commercial functions, which may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all and which could harm our reputation, future sales and profitability. The extent of any future pandemic or public health emergency’s effect on our business and industry will depend on, among other things, the severity of the disease, the successful development, distribution and acceptance of vaccines for diseases, future resurgences and/or the spread of disease variants, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. The COVID-19 pandemic materially impacted us, and any future pandemic or public health emergency could materially impact us and would heighten many of the other risks described in this report.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nCurrent economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change\n: Our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform in the countries in which we operate as new guidance is published and new regulations are adopted. In addition, further changes in the tax laws could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has put forth\ntwo proposed frameworks—Pillar One and Pillar Two—that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and ensure a minimal level of taxation, respectively. On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the Inclusive Framework’s global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%, and various countries (both within and outside the European Union) have enacted new laws implementing Pillar Two or have proposed legislation. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on the two-pillar framework, with widespread implementation anticipated by 2024. These changes, and any additional contemplated changes, could increase tax expense.\nWe could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax\njurisdictions in which we operate:\nWe operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations. Income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.\nThe impact of healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain:\nSeveral markets where we sell our products are making efforts to expand access to health care or health insurance coverage while decreasing costs. These efforts may have a direct or unintended negative impact on access to medical technology and could have a significant effect on our business. We cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations could ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect that any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business. Similarly, we cannot predict the impact that healthcare reform legislation in other countries where we sell our products may have on our business.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the classification, manufacturing, sterilization, licensing, labeling, marketing and sale of our products:\nThe classification, manufacturing, sterilization, licensing, labeling, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the FDA, state governments, European Union and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally. These governmental authorities may impose additional requirements or limits on the methods, procedures or agents we use to manufacture and sterilize our products, which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, the process of obtaining licenses, regulatory clearances and/or approvals to market and sell our products can be costly and time consuming and the clearances and/or approvals might not be granted timely. We have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, state Boards of Pharmacy and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system, medical device reporting regulations and other requirements. We incur significant costs to comply with regulations, including the MDR. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action, product seizures, recalls, import restrictions, the suspension of product manufacturing or sales, revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, substantial fines and criminal prosecution.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare regulations, including anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-kickback and false claims laws, globally and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws:\nThe relationships that we, and third parties that market and/or sell our products, have with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals, healthcare organizations and others, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In addition, the United States and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws. We also must comply with a variety of other laws that impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals and others. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been, and in the future could be, required to incur substantial costs to investigate, audit and monitor compliance or to alter our practices. Violations or alleged violations of these laws could result in litigation and we may be subject to criminal or civil penalties and sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. In 2013 and 2018 we settled claims brought by the SEC related to the FCPA. Pursuant to these settlements, we paid fines and penalties and retained an independent compliance consultant. We continue to implement recommendations that resulted from the independent compliance consultant’s review of our commercial practices to enhance our commercial business practices. In addition, we are currently investigating whether certain business activities in certain foreign countries violated provisions of the FCPA and have been contacted by the SEC, United States Department of Justice and certain other regulatory authorities. Although we are currently unable to predict the outcome of the investigations or the potential impact, if any, on our financial statements, the impacts could potentially be significant.\nWe are subject to privacy, data protection and data security regulations and laws globally, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws:\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personally identifiable healthcare information. For example, in the United States, privacy and security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, including the expanded requirements under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI), by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of PHI. Regulators are also imposing new data privacy and security requirements, including new and greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) established rules regarding the handling of personal data. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of total company revenue. Various U.S. states and other governmental authorities around the world have imposed or are considering similar types of laws and regulations, data breach reporting and penalties for non-compliance and increasing security requirements. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been, and in the future could be, required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices. As new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in\nthe case of data breaches, have increased and may further increase.\nWe may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements:\nWe are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. We are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to our Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular-Neck hip stems, LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads and the product liability lawsuits and claims relating to Wright Medical Group N.V. (Wright) legacy hip products discussed in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable. Further, the European Representative Actions Directive (the Collective Redress Directive), which became effective in 2023, mandates a class action regime in each EU member state to facilitate domestic and cross-border class actions in a wide range of areas, including product liability claims with medical devices. The Collective Redress Directive could result in additional litigation risks and significant legal expenses. In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses or reputational damage for product liability claims regardless of whether we are found to be liable.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products:\nThe medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of the outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.\nDependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios:\nOur long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio. Also, our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues. In addition, currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents.\nMARKET RISKS\nWe have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into United States Dollars:\nWe report our financial results in United States Dollars and approximately 25% of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen. Cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects. While we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the United States Dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into United States Dollars.\nAdditional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms, which could negatively affect our liquidity:\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, current and future\nacquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt. Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing. Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements. In addition, we have experienced, and could in the future experience, loss of sales and profits due to delayed payments or insolvency of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers and suppliers facing liquidity issues due to the current macroeconomic environment, type and number of conditions being treated or for other reasons. As a result, we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow, including through the reduction of operating expenses or suspension of dividend payments.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE RISKS\nWe could be negatively impacted by corporate responsibility and sustainability-related matters:\nGovernments, investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders have been increasingly focused on corporate responsibility practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area continue to rapidly evolve. On occasion, we announce new initiatives, including goals, under our corporate responsibility framework. This framework is aligned with our areas of interest, which include environment and sustainability, social impact, diversity, equity and inclusion and supply chain management, among others. Implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside our control. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve our announced corporate responsibility goals and initiatives. The criteria by which our corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change due to the quickly evolving landscape, which could result in greater regulatory requirements or expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. Moreover, the increasing attention to corporate responsibility initiatives could also result in reduced demand for our products, reduced profits and increased investigations and litigation. If we are unable to satisfy evolving criteria, investors and other stakeholders may conclude that our policies and/or actions with respect to corporate responsibility matters are inadequate. If we fail or are perceived to have failed to achieve previously announced initiatives or goals, comply with corporate responsibility laws and regulations, meet evolving expectations or accurately disclose our progress, we could face legal and regulatory proceedings and our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nPhysical effects of climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures intended to address climate change could adversely affect our operations and operating results:\nRisks associated with climate change are subject to increasing societal, regulatory and political focus in the United States and globally. Shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, extreme temperatures or flooding, which could cause more significant business and supply chain interruptions, damage to our products and facilities as well as the infrastructure of hospitals, medical care facilities and other customers, reduced workforce availability, increased costs of raw materials and components, increased liabilities and decreased revenues than what we have experienced in the past from such events. In addition, increased public concern over climate change has resulted in certain, and could result in additional, new legal or regulatory requirements\ndesigned to mitigate the effects of climate change, which could include the adoption of more stringent environmental laws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations. Such developments could result in increased compliance costs and adverse impacts on raw material availability and sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products, which could adversely affect our operations and operating results."

    "text": "RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\nWe review cybersecurity risk as part of our overall enterprise risk management program. This ensures that cybersecurity risk management remains a top priority in our business strategy and operations.\nMANAGEMENT'S ROLE IN MANAGING RISK\nPrimary management responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our cybersecurity risks rests with our chief information security officer (\"CISO\"). Our current CISO has over 30 years of experience in information technology including over 20 years in cybersecurity and oversees a team of cybersecurity professionals with over 140 security, risk, and compliance certifications. The CISO is regularly informed about recent developments in cybersecurity, including potential threats and innovative risk management techniques.\nThe CISO implements and oversees processes for the regular monitoring of our information systems. We use various tools and methodologies to manage cybersecurity risk that are tested regularly. We also monitor and evaluate our cybersecurity posture and performance on an ongoing basis through regular vulnerability scans, penetration tests and threat intelligence feeds. In addition, we engage third-party consultants to conduct annual cybersecurity assessments and to conduct audits for compliance with regulatory, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Service Organization Control Type 2 and\nInternational Organization for Standardization standards. We also engage third parties to assess our cybersecurity maturity and risk management programs.\nWe use a cross-departmental approach to addressing cybersecurity risk, with our cybersecurity, product security and legal teams presenting quarterly on key topics to a committee of leaders in finance, regulatory, and corporate affairs functions. This leadership committee meets quarterly to ensure that we have input and oversight from critical stakeholders into our cybersecurity program and evolving issues.\nThe CISO oversees a training and awareness program for employees to take part in protecting the Company against cybersecurity risks. We have implemented annual mandatory security education to help employees understand cybersecurity risks and comply with our cybersecurity policies. Additionally, we provide frequent communications around pertinent cybersecurity topics and policies to all employees. We also provide additional cybersecurity and data protection training to employees in certain roles.\nAs part of our cybersecurity risk management program, we also conduct cybersecurity and privacy assessments on all third parties who integrate with Stryker’s data, network, systems and products. We use a combination of internal and external tools to confirm that these third parties meet our security requirements. We leverage standard industry threat model and privacy impact assessment concepts to confirm that data minimization and adequate data protections are in place. We perform supplemental reviews as necessary, commensurate with the risk associated with each vendor.\nIn the event of a cybersecurity incident, we have an incident response plan that includes immediate actions to mitigate the impact and long-term strategies for remediation and prevention of future incidents. The cybersecurity and product security teams routinely practice this plan with functions across the organization. We conduct tabletop exercises with senior management, during which we practice the procedures in place to ensure that potentially material cybersecurity risks and incidents are escalated to management and the Board of Directors where applicable.\nGOVERNANCE\nCybersecurity risks are overseen by the full Board of Directors and the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is central to the Board of Directors’ oversight of cybersecurity risks and bears the primary responsibility for overseeing cybersecurity risk. The Audit Committee actively participates in strategic decisions related to cybersecurity, offering guidance and approval for major cybersecurity initiatives. This involvement ensures that cybersecurity considerations are integrated into our broader strategic objectives.\nOur CISO provides comprehensive updates to the Audit Committee quarterly and the full Board of Directors at least annually. These briefings include a range of topics, including:\n•\nCurrent cybersecurity landscape and emerging threats;\n•\nStatus of ongoing cybersecurity initiatives and strategies;\n•\nIncident reports and learnings from any cybersecurity events;\n•\nMetrics demonstrating company and industry-standard prevention of common threats; and\n•\nRegulatory changes impacting cybersecurity requirements and strategy.\nThe Board of Directors is aware of the critical nature of managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats and is actively engaged in our cybersecurity risk management strategy.\nRISKS FROM CYBERSECURITY THREATS\nAlthough cybersecurity risks have not materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, to date, we face numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats in our business. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see the risk factor entitled \"We, our business partners or our third-party vendors could experience a material failure or breach of a key information technology system, network, process or site\" in Item 1A.

We offer innovative products and services in MedSurg, Neurotechnology, Orthopaedics and Spine that help improve patient and healthcare outcomes. Alongside our customers around the world, we impact more than 150 million patients annually. Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (MedTech) industry and maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy that prioritizes: (1) Acquisitions, (2) Dividends and (3) Share repurchases.\nMacroeconomic Environment\nThe global economy continues to experience increased inflationary pressures in part due to global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and other impacts of the macroeconomic environment which we anticipate will continue. Higher interest rates and capital costs, higher shipping costs, increased costs of labor, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and the military conflicts in Russia and Ukraine and the Middle East create additional economic challenges and uncertainties. These conditions may cause our customers to decrease or delay orders for our products and services, and the higher interest rates may impact deal mix for our capital products.\nOverview of 2023\nIn 2023 we achieved reported net sales growth of 11.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales grew 11.5% in constant currency. We reported net earnings of $3,165 and net earnings per diluted share\nof\n$8.25. Excluding the impact\nof certain items, we achieved adjusted net earnings\n(1)\nof $4,066 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share\n(1)\nof $10.60 representing growth of 13.5%.\nWe continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $390 in acquisitions and paying $1,139 in dividends to our shareholders.\nIn May 2023 we acquired Cerus for net cash consideration of $289 and up to $225 in future milestone payments. Cerus designs, develops and manufactures neurovascular products used for the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke. Cerus is part of our Neurovascular business within MedSurg and Neurotechnology. Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nDuring 2023 we made payments of $850 to extinguish the remaining balance on the $1.5 billion term loan scheduled to mature February 22, 2025.\nIn August 2023 we issued €500 of floating rate senior notes due November 16, 2024. The notes bear interest at a rate based on the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) plus 0.3%. The notes are callable at February 16, 2024, May 16, 2024 or October 16, 2024 either by us or at the option of the notes holders.\nIn November 2023 we repaid the outstanding €550 principal amount of 1.125% senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2023 and in December 2023 we repaid the outstanding $600 principal amount of 0.600% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2023. We subsequently issued $600 of 4.850% senior unsecured notes due December 8, 2028 and €600 of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due December 11, 2028.\n(1)\nRefer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures used in this report and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nnm - not meaningful\nNote: Beginning in the first quarter 2023 we consolidated Other MedSurg and Neurotechnology into Endoscopy as Other MedSurg and Neurotechnology (primarily Sustainability Solutions) has been fully integrated into our Endoscopy business. Endoscopy includes sales related to Other of $343, $302 and $277 for 2023, 2022 and 2021. We have reflected these changes in all historical periods presented.\nConsolidated Net Sales\nConsolidated net sales in 2023 increased 11.1% as reported and 11.6% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 0.5%. Excluding the 0.1% impact of acquisitions and divestitures, net sales in constant currency increased by 10.9% from increased unit volume and 0.6% due to higher prices. The unit volume increase was primarily due to higher shipments across all product lines.\nConsolidated net sales in 2022 increased 7.8% as reported and 11.0% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 3.2%. Excluding the 1.3% impact of acquisitions and divestitures, net sales in constant currency increased by 10.6% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.9% due to lower prices. The unit volume increase was due to higher shipments across all MedSurg and Neurotechnology products and most Orthopaedics and Spine products.\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology Net Sales\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology net sales in 2023 increased 11.5% as reported and 12.1% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 0.6%. Excluding the 0.3% impact of acquisitions and divestitures, net sales in constant currency increased by 10.2% from increased unit volume and 1.6% due to higher prices. The unit volume increase was due to higher shipments across all MedSurg and Neurotechnology products.\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology net sales in 2022 increased 11.2% as reported and 14.1% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 2.9%. Excluding the 2.3% impact of acquisitions and divestitures, net sales in constant currency increased by 11.2% from increased unit volume and 0.6% due to higher prices. The unit volume increase was due to higher shipments across all MedSurg and Neurotechnology products.\nOrthopaedics and Spine Net Sales\nOrthopaedics and Spine net sales in 2023 increased 10.5% as reported and 11.1% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 0.6%.

Net sales in constant currency increased by 9.9% from increased unit volume partially offset by 2.9% due to lower prices. The unit volume increase was due to higher shipments across most Orthopaedics and Spine products.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $13,058, $11,578 and $10,968 in 2023, 2022, and 2021. The key components of the change were:\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 63.7% in 2023 from 62.8% in 2022 due to higher sales pricing and favorable volume offset by higher manufacturing and supply chain costs primarily due to higher raw material costs in the first six months of 2023 and supply chain inefficiencies.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 62.8% in 2022 from 64.1% in 2021 due to higher manufacturing and supply chain costs primarily due to increased costs from purchases of electronic components at premium prices on the spot market and other inflationary pressures, primarily related to labor, steel and transportation, as well as inefficiencies from supply chain disruptions partially offset by favorable volume and lower amortization of inventory stepped up to fair value.\nWhile segment mix was not a significant driver of the change in gross profit as a percent of net sales between 2023, 2022 and 2021, we generally expect segment mix to have an unfavorable impact for the foreseeable future as we anticipate more rapid sales growth in our lower gross margin MedSurg and Neurotechnology segment than our Orthopaedics and Spine segment.\nResearch, Development and Engineering Expenses\nResearch, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2023 decreased to 6.8% from 7.9% in 2022 primarily due to increased spending for product launches, the write-off of certain intangible assets and higher spend related to medical device regulations in the European Union in 2022.\nResearch, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 increased to 7.9% from 7.2% in 2021 primarily due to increased spending for product launches, the write-off of certain intangible assets and higher spend related to the new medical device regulations in the European Union in 2022.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2023 decreased to 34.8% from 35.0% in 2022 primarily due to charges of $132 related to share-based awards for Vocera employees that vested upon our acquisition in 2022, partially offset by disciplined increases in spend and investments in 2023 to support our growth, including sales growth incentives and increased spend on travel and meetings. In addition, in 2022 we determined that certain commercial and regulatory milestones related to technology acquired in the purchase of Mobius Imaging and Cardan Robotics were no longer probable of being achieved and recorded $110 to reduce the fair value of contingent consideration.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 decreased to 35.0% from 37.6% in 2021. Both 2022 and 2021 included charges related to certain asset impairments. Refer to Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In 2022 we determined that\ncertain commercial and regulatory milestones related to technology acquired in the purchase of Mobius Imaging and Cardan Robotics were no longer probable of being achieved and recorded $110 to reduce the fair value of contingent consideration. In addition, we recorded charges of $132 related to share-based awards for Vocera employees that vested upon our acquisition in 2022.\nRecall Charges, Net\nRecall charges, net were $18, ($15) and $103 in 2023, 2022 and 2021. Charges in 2021 were primarily due to the previously disclosed Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular-Neck hip stems and LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads voluntary recalls. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $635, $627 and $619 in 2023, 2022 and 2021. These amounts include amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the second quarter 2023 from Cerus and in the first quarter 2022 from Vocera. Refer to Notes 6 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn 2022 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $216 related to our Spine business. Refer to Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nOperating Income\nOperating income was $3,888, $2,841 and $2,584 in 2023, 2022 and 2021. Operating income increased as a percentage of sales to 19.0% in 2023 from 15.4% in 2022 and from 15.1% in 2021. Refer to the comments above for discussion of the primary drivers of the change.\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 28.2% in 2023 from 25.8% in 2022. MedSurg and Neurotechnology operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.8% in 2022 from 29.4% in 2021. Orthopaedics and Spine operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 27.7% in 2023 from 29.3% in 2022. Orthopaedics and Spine operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.3% in 2022 from 28.8% in 2021. The key components of the change were:\nThe increase in MedSurg and Neurotechnology operating income as a percentage of net sales in 2023 from 2022 was primarily driven by higher unit volumes, higher prices and lower\nmanufacturing and supply chain costs due to supply chain challenges impacting capital products in our MedSurg businesses in 2022 which improved in 2023 partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses due to continued investments including sales growth incentives and a more normalized cadence of travel and meetings.\nThe decrease in MedSurg and Neurotechnology operating income as a percentage of net sales in 2022 from 2021 was primarily driven by higher manufacturing and supply chain costs due to supply chain challenges impacting capital products in our MedSurg businesses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses due to a return to more normal levels following the COVID pandemic partially offset by higher unit volumes and prices.\nThe decrease in Orthopaedics and Spine operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2023 from 2022 was primarily driven by higher selling, general and administrative expenses due to continued investments including sales growth incentives and a more normalized cadence of travel and meetings and higher manufacturing and supply chain costs primarily due to increased inventory reserves partially offset by higher unit volumes.\nThe increase in Orthopaedics and Spine operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2022 from 2021 was primarily driven by higher unit volumes partially offset by lower prices.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was ($215), ($158) and ($303) in 2023, 2022 and 2021. The increase in net expense in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the release of accrued interest of $50 in 2022 related to the effective settlement of the United States federal income tax audit for years 2014 through 2018. Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The decrease in net expense in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to the aforementioned release of accrued interest and higher interest income in 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 13.8%, 12.1% and 12.6% for 2023, 2022 and 2021. The effective income tax rate for 2023 increased from 2022 due to the 2022 effective settlement of the United States federal income tax audit for years 2014 through 2018 and the 2022 reversal of deferred income tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries partially offset by the 2023 tax effect related to transfers of intellectual property between tax jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for 2022 decreased from 2021 due to the 2022 effective settlement of the United States federal income tax audit for years 2014 through 2018 and the 2022 reversal of deferred income tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The effective income tax rates for 2023, 2022 and 2021 reflect the continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations, the tax effect related to the transfers of intellectual property between tax jurisdictions, the tax effect of future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and certain discrete tax items.\nNet Earnings\nNet earnings for 2023 increased to $3,165 or $8.25 per diluted share from $2,358 or $6.17 per diluted share in 2022 and $1,994 or $5.21 per diluted share in 2021. Refer to the comments above for discussion of the primary drivers of the change.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures,\nincluding percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research, development and engineering expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted income taxes; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS). We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. The income tax effect of each adjustment was determined based on the tax effect of the jurisdiction in which the related pre-tax adjustment was recorded. These adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:\n1.\nAcquisition and integration-related costs\n. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses (e.g., costs associated with the termination of sales relationships, employee retention and workforce reductions, manufacturing integration costs and other integration-related activities), changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, amortization of inventory stepped-up to fair value, specific costs (e.g., deal costs and costs associated with legal entity rationalization) related to the consummation of the acquisition process and legal entity rationalization and acquisition-related tax items.\n2.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets.\n3.\nStructural optimization and other special charges.\nCosts associated with employee retention and workforce reductions, the closure or transfer of manufacturing and other facilities (e.g., site closure costs, contract termination costs and redundant employee costs during the work transfers), product line exits (primarily inventory, long-lived asset and specifically-identified intangible asset write-offs), certain long-lived and intangible asset write-offs and impairments and other charges.\n4.\nMedical device regulations.\nCosts specific to updating our\nquality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product remanufacturing to comply with the new medical device reporting regulations and other requirements of the European Union.\n5.\nRecall-related matters\n. Changes in our best estimate of the  probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within a range is not known, to resolve the Rejuvenate, LFIT V40, Wright legacy hip products and other product recalls.\n6.\nRegulatory and legal matters\n. Changes in our best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within a range is not known, to resolve certain regulatory or other legal matters and the amount of favorable awards from settlements.\n7.\nTax matters\n. Impact of accounting for certain significant and discrete tax items.\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same\nor similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, income taxes, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Consolidated Results of Operations below. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of adjusted net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period.\nReconciliation of the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measure to Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n(a) Charges represent certain acquisition and integration-related costs associated with acquisitions, including:\n(b) Structural optimization and other special charges represent the costs associated with:\n(c)  Charges represent the costs specific to updating our quality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product remanufacturing to comply with the medical device reporting regulations and other requirements of the new medical device regulations in the European Union.\n(d)  Charges represent changes in our best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within a range is not known, to resolve certain recall-related matters.\n(e)  Charges represent changes in our best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within a range is not known, to resolve certain regulatory or other legal matters and the amount of favorable awards from settlements.\n(f)   Benefits / (charges) represent the accounting impact of certain significant and discrete tax items, including:\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates despite the current macroeconomic environment. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary. Our overall cash position reflects our business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $3,711, $2,624 and $3,263 in 2023, 2022 and 2021. The increase from 2022 was primarily due to higher net earnings and increased collections on accounts receivable. The decrease in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to higher costs for certain electronic components and pre-buying of critical raw materials to manage supply chain delays as well as higher accounts receivable as a result of sales occurring near the end of the year, partially offset by increased net earnings.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $962, $2,924 and $859 in 2023, 2022 and 2021. The decrease in cash used in 2023 was primarily due to lower amounts paid for acquisitions. Our 2023 acquisitions included Cerus and in 2022 we acquired Vocera.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $1,594, $749 and $2,365 in 2023, 2022 and 2021. Cash used in 2023 was primarily driven by dividend payments of $1,139 and repayments of debt, including $850 to pay off the $1,500 term loan used to fund the acquisition of Vocera and $1,208 to pay off maturing senior unsecured notes. These repayments were offset by net proceeds of $1,781 from the issuance of various senior unsecured notes as described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2022 we made payments of $653 on long-term debt and dividend payments of $1,051. In 2021 we made payments of $1,151 on long-term debt and dividend payments of $950. There were no share repurchases in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nWe maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nLiquidity\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $3,053 and $1,928, and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $4,597 and $3,972 on December 31, 2023 and 2022. We\nanticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. We also have a revolving credit agreement maturing in October 2026 with an aggregate principal amount of $2,250.\nWe raised funds in the capital markets in the past and may continue to do so from time-to-time. We continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the United States was approximately 25% and 36% on December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nGuarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTS\nIn 2023 we recorded charges for various legal matters as further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recorded reserves represent the best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known. The final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different from the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.\nAs further described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2023 we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of $371. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.\nAs further described in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2023 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $341, of which approximately $337 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, there are certain accounting policies, which may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. We believe these accounting\npolicies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.\nActual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncome Taxes\nOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.\nInherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nDue to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.\nAcquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived Assets\nOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.\nIn some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired). For asset acquisitions, IPRD is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. Our annual impairment testing date is October 31.\nWhen it is unlikely that an indefinite-lived intangible asset or goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired, we perform a qualitative assessment. For goodwill, that qualitative assessment may be periodically supplemented with a corroborative quantitative analysis.\nWhen necessary, we perform a quantitative impairment test and determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or reporting unit using an income approach. For the quantitative impairment test of goodwill, we corroborate our concluded value under the income approach using a market approach that utilizes trading multiples derived from a peer set of similar companies. The income approach calculates the present value of estimated\nfuture cash flows and requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows used to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal business plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.\nDuring 2022 our Spine reporting unit’s operating performance was affected by several factors, including a slower than anticipated recovery of surgery volumes as we emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, rising costs and our competitive environment. Consequently, for the year ended December 31, 2022 revenues, gross margin and operating income were 3%, 4% and 33% below budgeted amounts. For our annual impairment test at October 31, 2022 we performed a quantitative impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $216 in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Due to the impairment charge in 2022, we also performed a quantitative impairment test for our Spine reporting unit at October 31, 2023 and determined that its fair value exceeded its carrying amount by 10%. Accordingly, we did not record any additional impairment charges. At October 31, 2023, goodwill attributable to the Spine reporting unit was approximately $1.0 billion.\nIn our quantitative impairment tests, the fair value of our Spine reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, which is a form of the income approach. Significant inputs to the analysis included assumptions for future revenue growth, operating margin and the rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows to their present value, based on the reporting unit’s estimated weighted average cost of capital. Our assumptions for revenue growth and operating margin considered several operating factors, including surgery volumes, increased costs and our competitive environment. We believe our estimates are appropriate based upon current and future market conditions and the best information available at the impairment assessment date. However, future impairment charges could be required if we do not achieve our cash flow, revenue and profitability projections or if there is an increase in the weighted average cost of capital.\nThe assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis are subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity. The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments with respect to the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of the discount rate used to reduce such estimated future cash flows to their net present value could materially affect the determination of any impairment charges. Hypothetical changes in our estimates of the discount rate, long-term revenue growth and long-term operating margin would result in impairment charges as follows:\nHistorical impairment assessments for our other reporting units have indicated that their implied fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts by at least 100%. We did not identify any factors in 2023 or 2022 that would lead us to believe that those reporting units are at risk of a goodwill impairment. Accordingly, we performed qualitative assessments and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of those\nreporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount rates and cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of fair value. A significant reduction in estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.\nWe review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor, intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for certain claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information."

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1974.\nGrand Rapids, Michigan\nFebruary 14, 2024\nStryker Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation of dilutive employee stock options were\n4.3\nin 2022 and de minimis in all other periods.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nStryker Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nStryker Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nStryker Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 -\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations:\nStryker (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is a global leader in medical technologies and, together with its customers, is driven to make healthcare better. The Company offers innovative products and services in MedSurg, Neurotechnology, Orthopaedics and Spine that help improve patient and healthcare outcomes. Our products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products; clinical communication and workflow solutions; neurosurgical and neurovascular devices; implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted technology; spinal devices; as well as other products used in a variety of medical specialties.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation:\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. We have no material interests in variable interest entities and none that require consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses in the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition:\nSales are recognized as the performance obligations to deliver products or services (including services under extended warranty service contracts) are satisfied and are recorded based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations. Our sales are recognized primarily when we transfer control to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment, the date of receipt by the customer or, for most Orthopaedics products, when we have received a purchase order and appropriate notification the product has been used or implanted. Products and services are primarily transferred to customers at a point in time, with some transfers of services taking place over time.\nSales represent the amount of consideration we expect to receive from customers in exchange for transferring products and services. Net sales exclude sales, value added and other taxes we collect from customers. Other costs to obtain and fulfill contracts are generally expensed as incurred due to the short-term nature of most of our sales. We extend terms of payment to our customers based on commercially reasonable terms for the markets of our customers, while also considering their credit quality.\nA provision for estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates is recognized as a reduction of sales in the same period that the sales are recognized. Our estimate of the provision for sales returns has been established based on contract terms with our customers and historical business practices and current trends. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net sales.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of sales also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.\nResearch, Development and Engineering Expenses:\nResearch, development and engineering costs are charged to expense as incurred. Costs include research, development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients. Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of selling expenses, marketing expenses, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of loaner instrumentation, depreciation and amortization expense of non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.\nCurrency Translation:\nFinancial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into United States Dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). Transactional exchange gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net.\nCash Equivalents:\nHighly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased or other money market instruments that are redeemable upon demand are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.\nMarketable Securities:\nMarketable securities consist of marketable debt securities, certificates of deposit and mutual funds. Mutual funds are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities and are recognized in other noncurrent assets. Pursuant to our investment policy, all individual marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A (Standard & Poor’s and Fitch) and A2 (Moody’s Corporation) at the time of acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must maintain a minimum average credit quality of double A (Standard & Poor’s and Fitch) or Aa (Moody’s Corporation). In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to our marketable security investment portfolio. Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities. Investments in trading securities represent participant-directed investments of deferred employee compensation.\nAccounts Receivable:\nAccounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables. An allowance is maintained for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. Estimates are made regarding the ability of customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience, current market conditions and expected credit losses. Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.\nInventories:\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost generally determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. For excess and obsolete inventory\nresulting from the potential inability to sell specific products at prices in excess of current carrying costs, reserves are maintained to reduce current carrying cost to net realizable value.\nFinancial Instruments:\nOur financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts. The carrying value of our financial instruments, with the exception of our senior unsecured notes, approximates fair value on December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Notes 3 and 10 for further details.\nAll marketable securities are recognized at fair value. Adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale are recognized as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in shareholders’ equity and adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recognized in earnings. The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method. Such amortization and interest and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.\nWe review declines in the fair value of our investments classified as available-for-sale to determine whether the decline in fair value is a result of credit loss or other factors. Impairments of available-for-sale marketable debt securities related to credit loss are included in earnings and impairments related to other factors are recognized within AOCI.\nDerivatives:\nAll derivatives are recognized at fair value and reported on a gross basis. We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period.\nForward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to forecasted intercompany sales and purchases of manufactured products and generally have maturities up to\neighteen months\n. Changes in value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the underlying cash flows. At that time, the applicable amount of gain or loss from the derivative instrument that is deferred in shareholders’ equity is reclassified into earnings and is included in cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Cash flows associated with these hedges are included in cash from operations in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.\nForward currency exchange contracts are used to offset our exposure to the change in value of specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany payables and receivables. These derivatives are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related changes in value of foreign\ncurrency denominated assets and liabilities. The estimated fair value of our forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.\nFrom time to time, we designate derivative and non-derivative financial instruments as net investment hedges of our investments in certain international subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is recognized in OCI and reported as a component of AOCI. We have elected to use the spot method to assess effectiveness for our derivatives designated as net investment hedges. Accordingly, the change in fair value attributable to changes in the spot rate is recorded in AOCI. We exclude the spot-forward difference from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize this amount separately on a straight-line basis over the term of the forward contracts. This amortization is recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFrom time to time, we designate forward starting interest rate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuance and refinancing of debt. Changes in value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the underlying cash flows. At that time, the applicable amount of gain or loss from the derivative instrument that is deferred in shareholders’ equity is reclassified into earnings and is included in interest expense within other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nInterest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges have been used in the past to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of\nthree\nto\n30\nyears for buildings and improvements and\nthree\nto\n15\nyears for machinery and equipment.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses at the acquisition date, after amounts allocated to other identifiable intangible assets. Factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include synergies that are specific to our business and not available to other market participants and are expected to increase net sales and profits; acquisition of a talented workforce; cost savings opportunities; the strategic benefit of expanding our presence in core and adjacent markets; and diversifying our product portfolio.\nThe fair values of other identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are primarily determined using the income approach. Other intangible assets include, but are not limited to, developed technology, customer and distributor relationships (which reflect expected continued customer or distributor patronage) and trademarks and patents. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of\nfour\nto\n40\nyears. Certain acquired trade names are considered to have indefinite lives and are not amortized, but are assessed annually for potential impairment as described below.\nIn some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired). For asset acquisitions IPRD is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use.\nGoodwill, Intangibles and Long-Lived Asset Impairment Tests:\nWe perform our annual impairment test for goodwill as of October 31 each year. We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill and periodically corroborate that assessment with quantitative information. In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the individual carrying values to the fair value.\nWe review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset's useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nShare-Based Compensation:\nS\nhare-based compensation is in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). Stock options are granted under long-term incentive plans to certain key employees and non-employee directors at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock, which is the quoted closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant. The options are granted for periods of up to\n10\nyears and become exercisable in varying installments.\nWe grant RSUs to key employees and non-employee directors and PSUs to certain key employees under our long-term incentive plans. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the fact that RSUs do not include anticipated dividends. RSUs generally vest in one-third increments over a\nthree-year\nperiod and are settled in stock. PSUs are earned over a\nthree-year\nperformance cycle and vest in March of the year following the end of that performance cycle. The number of PSUs that will ultimately be earned is based on our performance relative to pre-established goals in that\nthree-year\nperformance cycle. The fair value of PSUs is determined based on the quoted closing price of our common stock on the day of grant.\nCompensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. Compensation expense recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the\nperiod required to obtain full vesting. Management expectations related to the achievement of performance goals associated with PSU grants is assessed regularly and that assessment is used to determine whether PSU grants are expected to vest. If performance-based milestones related to PSU grants are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense recognized associated with such grants will be reversed.\nIncome Taxes:\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefits generally represent the change in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the year. Other amounts result from adjustments related to acquisitions and foreign currency as appropriate.\nWe operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations. Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-09 (Topic 740):\nIncome Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nwhich expands the existing rules on income tax disclosures. This update requires entities to disclose specific categories in the tax rate reconciliation, provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold and disclose additional information about income taxes paid on an annual basis. The new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating these new expanded disclosure requirements.\nIn November 2023 the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nwhich expands disclosure requirements to require entities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to or easily computed from information regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. This update also requires all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 to be disclosed in interim periods. The new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating these new expanded disclosure requirements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn September 2022 the FASB issued ASU 2022-04,\nLiabilities - Supplier Finance Programs: Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n, which requires entities that utilize supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services to disclose information about the key terms of the programs, a rollforward of the obligations under the programs and where those obligations are presented in the balance sheet. The disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the requirement for rollforward information which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We participate in a supplier financing program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Stryker receivables to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. As of December 31, 2023 our obligations under this program are not material.\nNOTE 2 -\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nWe disaggregate our net sales by product line and geographic location for each of our segments as we believe it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and certainty of our net sales and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nProducts and services are primarily transferred to customers at a point in time, with some transfers of services taking place over time. In 2023 less than\n10\n% of our sales were recognized as services transferred over time. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion on our revenue recognition policies.\nBeginning in the first quarter 2023 we consolidated Other MedSurg and Neurotechnology into Endoscopy as Other MedSurg and Neurotechnology (primarily Sustainability Solutions) has been fully integrated into our Endoscopy business. Endoscopy includes sales related to Other of $\n343\n, $\n302\nand $\n277\nfor 2023, 2022 and 2021. We have reflected these changes in all historical periods presented.\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology products include surgical equipment and navigation systems (Instruments), endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy), patient handling, emergency medical equipment, intensive care disposable products and clinical communication and workflow solutions (Medical), minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (Neurovascular), a comprehensive line of products for traditional brain and open skull based surgical procedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products (Neuro Cranial). Substantially all MedSurg and Neurotechnology sales are recognized when a purchase order has been received and control has transferred. For certain Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical services, we may recognize sales over time as we satisfy performance obligations that may include an obligation to complete installation, provide training and perform ongoing services, generally performed within one year.\nOrthopaedics and Spine\nOrthopaedics and Spine products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremity surgeries, and cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies. Substantially all Orthopaedics sales are recognized when we have received a purchase order and appropriate notification the product has been used or implanted. Substantially all Spine sales are recognized when a purchase order has been received and control has transferred. For certain Orthopaedic products in the \"other\" category, we recognize sales at a point in time, as well as over time for performance obligations that may include an obligation to complete installation and provide training and ongoing services. Performance obligations are generally satisfied within one year.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nThe nature of our products and services do not generally give rise to contract assets as we typically do not incur costs to fulfill a contract before a product or service is provided to a customer. Our costs to obtain contracts are typically in the form of sales commissions paid to employees or third-party agents. Certain sales commissions paid to employees prior to recognition of sales are recorded as contract assets. We expense sales commissions associated with obtaining a contract at the time of the sale or as incurred as the amortization period is generally less than one year. These costs have been presented within selling, general and administrative expenses. On December 31, 2023 contract assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were not significant.\nOur contract liabilities arise as a result of consideration received from customers at inception of contracts for certain businesses or where the timing of billing for services precedes satisfaction of our performance obligations. This occurs primarily when payment is received upfront for certain multi-period extended warranty service contracts. Our contract liabilities of $\n860\nand $\n741\non December 31, 2023 and 2022 are classified within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities within our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the timing of when we expect to complete our performance obligations.\nChanges in contract liabilities during the year were as follows:\nNOTE 3 -\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nUse of observable market data, when available, is required in making fair value measurements. When inputs used fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We determine fair value for Level 1 instruments using exchange-traded prices for identical instruments. We determine fair value of Level 2 instruments using exchange-traded prices of similar instruments, where available, or utilizing other observable inputs that take into account our credit risk and that of our counterparties. Foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate hedges, when outstanding, are included in Level 2 and are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis. Our Level 3 liabilities are comprised of contingent consideration arising from recently completed acquisitions. We determine fair value of these Level 3 liabilities using a discounted cash flow technique. Significant unobservable inputs were used in our assessment of fair value, including assumptions regarding future business results, discount rates, discount periods and probability assessments based on the likelihood of reaching various targets.\nWe remeasure the fair value of our assets and liabilities each reporting period. We record the changes in fair value within selling, general and administrative expense.\nIn 2022 we determined that certain commercial and regulatory milestones related to technology acquired in the purchase of Mobius Imaging and Cardan Robotics were no longer probable of being achieved and recorded a $\n110\nreduction in the fair value of contingent consideration reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIn the second quarter 2023 we recorded $\n192\nof contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Cerus described in Note 6.\nThere were no significant transfers into or out of any level of the fair value hierarchy in 2023.\nOn December 31, 2023 the aggregate difference between the cost and fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities was nominal. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities income was $\n75\n, $\n25\nand $\n15\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021, which was recorded in other income (expense), net.\nOur investments in available-for-sale marketable securities had a minimum credit quality rating of A2 (Moody's), A (Standard & Poor's) and A (Fitch). We do not plan to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.\nNOTE 4 -\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nWe use operational and economic hedges, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, net investment hedges (both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments) and interest rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations on earnings, cash flow and equity. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. We are exposed to potential credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding derivative instruments but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties. Should a counterparty default, our maximum loss exposure is the asset balance of the instrument.\nForeign Currency Hedges\nWe had €\n1.5\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022 in certain forward currency contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our investments in certain of our entities with functional currencies denominated in Euros. In addition to these derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges, we had €\n4.9\nbillion and €\n4.4\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022 of senior unsecured notes designated as net investment hedges to selectively hedge portions of our investment in certain international subsidiaries. The increase in 2023 was due to the designation of €\n1.1\nbillion of senior unsecured notes issued in August and December as net investment hedges partially offset by the November maturity of €\n550\nof notes previously designated as a net investment hedge. See Note 10 for information on debt issuances and maturities. The currency effects of our Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes are reflected in AOCI within shareholders' equity where they offset gains and losses recorded on our net investment in international subsidiaries.\nIn 2022 we settled certain foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges resulting in cash proceeds of $\n197\n. The amounts in AOCI related to settled net investment hedges will remain in AOCI until the hedged investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.\nThe total after-tax gain (loss) recognized in OCI related to designated net investment hedges was ($\n215\n) in 2023.\nPretax gains (losses) on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of $\n26\nand net investment hedges of $\n27\nrecorded in AOCI are expected to be reclassified to cost of sales and other income (expense), net in earnings within 12 months as of December 31, 2023. This cash flow hedge reclassification is primarily due to the sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases. A component of the AOCI amounts related to net investment hedges is reclassified over the life of the hedge instruments as we elected to exclude the initial value of the component related to the spot-forward difference from the effectiveness assessment.\nInterest Rate Hedges\nIn conjunction with our offerings of senior unsecured notes in December 2023 we settled certain forward starting interest rate swap contracts with gross notional amounts of $\n200\nthat were designated as cash flow hedges. Pretax gains of $\n4\nrecorded in AOCI related to interest rate hedges closed in conjunction with debt issuances are expected to be reclassified to other income (expense), net in earnings within 12 months of December 31, 2023. The cash flow effect of interest rate hedges is recorded in cash flow from operations.\nNOTE 5 -\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME (AOCI)\nNOTE 6 -\nACQUISITIONS\nWe acquire stock in companies and various assets that continue to support our capital deployment and product development strategies. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $\n390\nand $\n2,563\nin 2023 and 2022.\nOn May 2, 2023 we acquired Cerus for net cash consideration of $\n289\nand up to $\n225\nin future milestone payments that had a fair value of $\n192\nat the acquisition date. Cerus designs, develops and manufactures neurovascular products used for the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke. Cerus is part of our Neurovascular business within MedSurg and Neurotechnology. Goodwill attributable to the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.\nIn February 2022 we completed the acquisition of Vocera for $\n79.25\nper share, or an aggregate purchase price of $\n2.6\nbillion, net of cash acquired ($\n3.0\nbillion including convertible notes). Vocera is a leader in the digital care coordination and communication category. Vocera is part of our Medical business within MedSurg and Neurotechnology. Goodwill attributable to the acquisition reflects the strategic benefits of expanding our presence in adjacent markets, diversifying our product portfolio, advancing innovations and accelerating our digital aspirations. This goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes\n.\nDuring 2022 note holders elected to redeem the\n1.50\n% and\n0.50\n% convertible notes assumed in the Vocera acquisition for $\n101\nand $\n324\n. These repayments are classified as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nShare-based awards for Vocera employees vested upon our acquisition and a charge of $\n132\nwas recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2022.\nPurchase price allocations for our significant acquisitions are:\nThe purchase price allocation for Cerus is based on preliminary valuations, primarily related to developed technology and deferred income taxes. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. The purchase price allocation for Vocera was finalized in the first quarter 2023 without material adjustments.\nNOTE 7 -\nCONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS\nWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor, intellectual property and other matters, the most significant of which are more fully described below. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less\nfavorable than those estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are self-insured for certain claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn April 2022 the United States District Court for the District of Delaware issued a judgment following a jury verdict in favor of PureWick Corporation (PureWick) for its 2019 complaint seeking patent infringement damages related to our PrimaFit and PrimoFit products. We recorded charges of $\n28\nin March 2022 accordingly. Stryker is appealing the results of the trial. In June 2022 PureWick filed a motion to enhance the damages awarded, which the court denied in March 2023. In 2022 PureWick also filed a separate complaint seeking additional patent infringement damages, damages enhancement and an injunction related to another version of our PrimaFit products. A trial for this matter is currently set for February 2024. PureWick may seek to recover its legal fees if it is ultimately successful in either matter.\nWe are currently investigating whether certain business activities in certain foreign countries violated provisions of the FCPA and have engaged outside counsel to conduct these investigations. We have been contacted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, United States Department of Justice and certain other regulatory authorities and are cooperating with these agencies. At this time we are unable to predict the outcome of the investigations or the potential impact, if any, on our financial statements.\nWe have conducted voluntary recalls of certain products, including our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems and certain lot-specific sizes and offsets of LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads. Additionally, we are responsible for certain product liability claims, primarily related to certain hip products sold by Wright prior to its 2014 divestiture of the OrthoRecon business.\nWe have incurred, and expect to incur in the future, costs associated with the defense and settlement of claims and lawsuits. Based on the information that has been received related to the matters discussed above, we recorded charges of $\n85\nin 2023, and our accrual for these matters was $\n292\nat December 31, 2023, representing our best estimate of probable loss. The final outcomes of these matters are dependent on many factors that are difficult to predict. Accordingly the ultimate cost related to these matters may be materially different than the amount of our current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nLeases\nWe lease various manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities, administrative and sales offices as well as equipment under operating leases. We evaluate our contracts to identify leases, which is generally if there is an identified asset and we have the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the identified asset. Certain of our lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses (including index-based escalations), rent holidays, capital improvement funding or other lease incentives. We recognize our minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning with the date of initial control of the asset. Right-of-use assets are recorded in Other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current and noncurrent lease liabilities are recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities, respectively.\nWe have made certain significant assumptions and judgments when recording leases. For all asset classes, we do not recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for short-term leases. We also do not separate non-lease components from lease components to which they relate and account for the combined lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The determination of the discount rate used in a lease is our incremental borrowing rate which is based on what we would normally pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments.\nOperating lease expense totaled $\n172\n, $\n149\n, and $\n133\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nFuture Obligations\nWe have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. In addition, we lease various manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities, administrative and sales offices as well as equipment under operating leases. Refer to Note 10 for more information on the debt obligations.\nNOTE 8 -\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIn our annual impairment tests of goodwill as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment of the Spine reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value. Significant inputs to the analysis included assumptions for future revenue growth and operating margin. The analysis also included a rate to discount the estimated future cash flow projections to their present value, based on the reporting unit’s estimated weighted average cost of capital.\nIn 2022, the carrying value of the Spine reporting unit exceeded its fair value and a charge of $\n216\nwas recognized in the Goodwill impairment line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The impairment charge for the Spine reporting unit was primarily driven by the slower than anticipated recovery of surgery volumes as we emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, the competitive pressures in the spine market and rising interest rates in the macroeconomic environment at that time. Due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2022, for our annual impairment test in 2023 we also elected to perform a quantitative assessment. As a result of that assessment we concluded that goodwill of the Spine reporting unit was not impaired in 2023 as its fair value exceeded its carrying value. Goodwill attributable to the Spine reporting unit as of December 31, 2023 was $\n1,034\n.\nFor our other reporting units, we considered qualitative indicators of impairment as it was considered more likely than not that the fair values of those reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. No impairment was identified for those reporting units in 2023 or 2022.\nFuture changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A\nsignificant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.\nNOTE 9 -\nCAPITAL STOCK\nThe aggregate number of shares of all classes of stock which we are authorized to issue is up to\n1,000,500,000\n, divided into two classes consisting of\n500,000\nshares of $\n1\npar value preferred stock and\n1,000,000,000\nshares of common stock with a par value of $\n0.10\n.\nNo\nshares of preferred stock were outstanding on December 31, 2023.\nWe made no repurchases of shares in 2023. The manner, timing and amount of repurchases are determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors and are subject to regulatory considerations. Purchases are made from time-to-time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. On December 31, 2023 the total dollar value of shares that could be purchased under our authorized repurchase program was $\n1,033\n.\nShares reserved for future compensation grants of our common stock were\n20\nmillion and\n23\nmillion on December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nStock Options\nWe measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date fair value and recognize that cost using the straight-line method over the period in which a recipient is required to\nprovide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period. The weighted-average fair value per share of options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock. The expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise and employee termination data.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options, which represents the cumulative difference between the fair market value of the underlying common stock and the option exercise prices, exercised was $\n318\n, $\n218\nand $\n253\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021. Exercise prices for options outstanding ranged from $\n77.75\nto $\n287.14\non December 31, 2023. On December 31, 2023 there was $\n135\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the long-term incentive plans; that cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of approximately\n1.6\nyears.\nOn December 31, 2023 there was $\n81\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized as expense over the weighted-average period of approximately\none year\n. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of RSUs granted was $\n257.09\nand $\n239.76\nin 2023 and 2022. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs vested in 2023 was $\n74\nand $\n10\n. On December 31, 2023 there was $\n19\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested PSUs; the cost is expected to be recognized as expense over the weighted-average period of approximately\none year\n.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP)\nEmployees may participate in our ESPP provided they meet certain eligibility requirements. The purchase price for our common stock under the terms of the ESPP is defined as\n95\n% of the closing stock price on the last trading day of a purchase period. We issued\n190,524\nand\n221,387\nshares under the ESPP in 2023 and 2022.\nNOTE 10 -\nDEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES\nWe have lines of credit issued by various financial institutions that are available to fund our day-to-day operating needs. Certain of our credit facilities require us to comply with financial and other covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants on December 31, 2023.\nIn 2022 our Board of Directors approved an increase to the maximum amount of commercial paper that can be outstanding from $\n1,500\nto $\n2,250\n.\nOn December 31, 2023 there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under our credit facility or commercial paper program which allows for maturities up to\n397\ndays from the date of issuance.\nDuring 2023 we made payments of $\n850\nto extinguish the remaining balance on the $\n1.5\nbillion term loan scheduled to mature on February 22, 2025.\nIn August 2023 we issued €\n500\nof floating rate senior notes due November 16, 2024. The notes bear interest at a rate based on the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) plus\n0.3\n%. The notes are callable at February 16, 2024, May 16, 2024 or October 16, 2024 either by us or at the option of the notes holders.\nIn November 2023 we repaid the outstanding €\n550\nprincipal amount of\n1.125\n% senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2023 and in December 2023 we repaid the outstanding $\n600\nprincipal amount of\n0.600\n% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2023. We subsequently issued $\n600\nof\n4.850\n% senior unsecured notes due December 8, 2028 and €\n600\nof\n3.375\n% senior unsecured notes due December 11, 2028. The following table summarizes our total debt at December 31:\nThe fair value of the senior unsecured notes was estimated using quoted interest rates, maturities and amounts of borrowings based on quoted active market prices and yields that took into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments. Substantially all of our debt is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nInterest expense on outstanding debt and credit facilities, including required fees incurred, that were included in other income (expense), net, totaled $\n356\n, $\n337\n, and $\n337\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nNOTE 11 -\nINCOME TAXES\nOur effective tax rate was\n13.8\n%,\n12.1\n% and\n12.6\n% for 2023, 2022 and 2021. The effective income tax rate for 2023 increased from 2022 due to the 2022 effective settlement of the United States federal income tax audit for years 2014 through 2018 and the 2022 reversal of deferred income tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries partially offset by the 2023 tax effect related to transfers of intellectual property between tax jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for 2022 decreased from 2021 due to the 2022 effective settlement of the United States federal income tax audit for years 2014 through 2018 and the 2022 reversal of deferred income tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The effective income tax rates for 2023, 2022 and 2021 reflect the continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations, the tax effect related to the transfers of intellectual property between tax jurisdictions, the tax effect of future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and certain discrete tax items.\nInterest and penalties included in other income (expense), net were expense of $\n1\nin 2023, income of $\n71\nin 2022 and expense of $\n23\nin 2021. The United States federal deferred income tax expense (benefit) includes the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of $\n189\n, $\n56\nand $\n283\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nAccrued interest and penalties were $\n67\nand $\n66\non December 31, 2023 and 2022 which were reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\nUnited States federal loss carryforwards of $\n254\n, with $\n53\nof associated deferred tax asset and with $\n2\nbeing subject to a valuation allowance, begin to expire in 2024. United States state loss carryforwards of $\n3,006\n, with $\n74\nassociated deferred tax asset and with $\n47\nbeing subject to a valuation allowance, begin to expire in 2024. International loss carryforwards of $\n259\n, with $\n66\nof associated deferred tax asset and with $\n63\nbeing subject\nto a valuation allowance, begin to expire in 2026; however, some have no expiration. We also have tax credit carryforwards of $\n208\nwith $\n79\nbeing subject to a full valuation allowance. The credits with a full valuation allowance begin to expire in 2024. We do not anticipate generating income tax in excess of the non-expiring credits in the foreseeable future.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted in 2017 in the United States. We recorded a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred. The Act also subjects a United States shareholder to tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. We have elected to account for GILTI tax in the year the tax is incurred.\nWe recorded deferred income tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries not determined to be indefinitely reinvested. In 2022 it was determined that, based on our revised capital plan, certain cash outside the United States would no longer need to be repatriated during the period previously contemplated. As a result deferred taxes of $\n71\nthat were recorded on the associated earnings were reversed. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries determined to be indefinitely reinvested at December 31, 2023 was approximately $\n11\nbillion. Determination of the total amount of unrecognized deferred income tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.\nOur income tax expense would have been reduced by $\n248\nand $\n289\nin 2023 and 2022 had these uncertain income tax positions been favorably resolved. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to one or more of the following events in the next 12 months: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including inventory transfer pricing, cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved. Interest and penalties incurred associated with uncertain tax positions are included in other income (expense), net.\nIn the normal course of business, income tax authorities in various income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally conduct routine audits of our income tax returns filed in prior years. These audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax jurisdictions. Income tax expense in 2022 decreased $\n162\ndue to the effective settlement of the United States federal income tax audit for years 2014 through 2018. In addition 2022 other income (expense), net includes a benefit of $\n50\nrelated to the release of accrued interest associated with this settlement. Income tax years are open from 2019 through the current year for the United\nStates federal jurisdiction. Income tax years open for our other major jurisdictions range from 2007 through the current year.\nNOTE 12 -\nRETIREMENT PLANS\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe provide certain employees with defined contribution plans and other types of retirement plans. A portion of our retirement plan expense under the defined contribution plans is funded with Stryker common stock. The use of Stryker common stock represents a non-cash operating activity that is not reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nCertain of our subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering some or all of their employees. The majority of our defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rates were selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds on December 31 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match our projected benefit payments.\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category based on historical and projected returns.\nThe actuarial gain (loss) for all pension plans was primarily related to a change in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations of those plans.\nInvestment Strategy\nThe investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plans is to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk tolerances.\nOur Level 3 pension plan assets consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts with insurance companies. The insurance contracts guarantee us principal repayment and a fixed rate of return. The $\n10\nincrease in Level 3 pension plan assets is primarily driven by the change in the corresponding pension liability. We expect to contribute $\n24\nto our defined benefit pension plans in 2024.\nNOTE 13 -\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 14 -\nSEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA\nWe segregate our operations into\ntwo\nreportable business segments: (i) MedSurg and Neurotechnology and (ii) Orthopaedics and Spine which aligns to our internal reporting structure and how the Company manages its businesses.\nThe Corporate and Other category shown in the table below includes corporate and administration, corporate initiatives and share-based compensation, which includes compensation related to employee stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock unit grants and director stock options and restricted stock unit grants.\nWe measure the financial results of our reportable segments using an internal performance measure that excludes acquisition and integration-related charges, structural optimization and other special charges, goodwill impairment, reserves for certain product recall matters and reserves for certain legal and regulatory matters. Identifiable assets are those assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or allocated when used jointly. Corporate assets are principally property, plant and equipment and noncurrent assets. Certain assets in 2022 have been reallocated to the segments to conform with current year presentation.\nThe countries in which we have local revenue generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States; Europe, Middle East, Africa; Asia Pacific; and other foreign countries, which include Canada and countries in the Latin American region. Net sales are reported based on the geographic area of the Stryker location where the sales to the customer originated.\nNOTE 15 -\nASSET IMPAIRMENTS\nAsset impairments recognized in 2023 were\nno\nt significant. Asset impairments recognized in 2022 included $\n47\nto write off long-lived and intangible assets primarily as a result of the exit of certain product lines.\nThe government in China conducts regional and national volume-based procurement (VBP) programs for high-value medical consumables as part of its efforts to reduce healthcare costs. Each VBP program has specific requirements to award contracts to the lowest bidders who are able to satisfy the quality and quantity requirements. As a result of the outcome of certain regional programs for our trauma products and the national VBP program for hips and knees we recorded charges of $\n105\nto impair certain long-lived and intangible assets in 2021. These charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIn addition to the above, we recorded asset impairments of $\n159\nin 2021 consisting primarily of in-process research and development, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as a result of COVID-19-related demand impacts on in-process product development and certain other divestiture and restructuring activities. These charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses."

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company's management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company's internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nThe Company's management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\n. Based on its assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nStryker’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Stryker Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 14, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/    Ernst & Young LLP\nGrand Rapids, Michigan\nFebruary 14, 2024"
