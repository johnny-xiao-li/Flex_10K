    "text": "INTRODUCTION\nQuest Diagnostics works across the healthcare ecosystem to create a healthier world, one life at a time.  We provide diagnostic insights from the results of our laboratory testing to empower people, physicians, and organizations to take action to improve health outcomes.  Derived from one of the world's largest databases of de-identifiable clinical lab results, our diagnostic insights reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management.  In the right hands and with the right context, our diagnostic insights can inspire actions that transform lives and create a healthier world.\nThe patients we serve annually comprise approximately one-third of the adult population of the United States, and over a three-year period, we serve approximately one-half of the adult population in the United States.  We estimate that annually we serve approximately half of the physicians and half of the hospitals in the United States.\nThe Quest Way\nWe operate our business and achieve our goals according to a clear set of principles we call “The Quest Way,” which consists of the following:\n•\nOur Purpose is to work together to create a healthier world, one life at a time.\n•\nOur Strategy to grow is to provide solutions that serve the evolving needs of our customers, based on our high quality, innovative, convenient and affordable services.\n•\nOur Culture, or how we work, is powered by what we call the “5Cs”: customer first, collaboration, care, continuous improvement, and curiosity.\nWe play a critical role in healthcare decisions for customers across the healthcare ecosystem, including physicians, hospitals, patients and consumers, health plans, government agencies,  employers, retailers, pharmaceutical companies and insurers.  We believe The Quest Way is aligned with the triple aim of healthcare of improving medical quality and the patient experience while reducing the overall cost of care.\nWe believe our employees are critical to our success, and we continually strive to create an environment that allows them to contribute to our goal of creating a healthier world.  We are focused on delivering services that help improve the physician and healthcare provider experience to enable us and them to deliver high quality, effective and affordable care to patients.  We provide a number of innovative ways for patients to access services from us, including consumer-initiated services offered through QuestHealth.com, which provides a high quality, self-directed option with physician oversight for individuals to gain insights into their health.\nDuring 2023, we generated net revenues of $9.3 billion.  Additional financial information concerning Quest Diagnostics for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is included in\n“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, It\nem 7 and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8.\nQuest Diagnostics was incorporated in Delaware in 1990; its predecessor companies date back to 1967.  We conduct business through our headquarters in Secaucus, New Jersey, and our laboratories, patient service centers, offices and other facilities around the United States and in selected locations outside the United States.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Quest Diagnostics,” “Quest,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” mean Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n1\nOUR STRATEGY\nOur strategy aims to achieve two key goals: generate growth and optimize our operating efficiency.\nOur growth strategy focuses on continually developing solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nWe help people make the best decisions to improve health by providing high quality, innovative, convenient and affordable diagnostic testing insights and services using our scale and extensive reach.\nWe drive growth by:\n•\ncollaborating with healthcare providers and partners to leverage our broad access;\n•\noffering an industry-leading menu of testing and other services;\n•\nleveraging our data assets and services to improve population health and enable value-based care; and\n•\ncontinuously improving our quality and efficiency by leveraging the Quest Management System and by embracing innovative technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI).\nOur growth strategy is focused on our primary customer channels – physicians, hospitals, patients and consumers – supported by Advanced Diagnostics™ (defined below), strategic acquisitions, and continuous quality improvement.\nPhysicians\nWe serve approximately half the physicians in the United States each year.  We serve virtually all types of physicians from primary care physicians and internists to specialists, including rheumatologists, cardiologists, neurologists, and obstetricians/gynecologists.\nWe also serve physicians associated with accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), and Federally Qualified Health Centers (“FQHCs”).\nPhysicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors, but we believe that we provide the most attractive service offering in the industry, including the most comprehensive test menu, innovative test offerings, a positive customer experience, a staff including medical and scientific experts, high quality, leading access and distribution, and data-powered integrated information-technology solutions.\nHospitals\nWe believe that the growing market challenges faced by hospitals, including continued consolidation, price transparency, cost and utilization pressure, evolving healthcare payment models, capital needs, changing technology and limited resources, provide us with an opportunity to partner with them more effectively as they consider their laboratory testing strategy and drive demand for our expertise and services.\nWe serve approximately half the hospitals in the United States each year in many ways, including:\n•\nServing as a hospital lab’s laboratory.\nIn 2023, we generated over $1 billion in revenue from “reference testing,” where we perform testing that hospitals do not perform in their own in-hospital labs.\n•\nHelping hospitals operate their labs more efficiently.\nIn 2023, our Professional Laboratory Services offering generated approximately $780 million in revenues and management fees supporting hospitals in the operation of their own labs.\nOur key Professional Laboratory Services offerings include lab management outsourcing, test menu optimization and spend consolidation, supply chain management and providing, advanced data solutions.\n•\nAcquiring outreach lab operations from hospitals.\nQuest looks for opportunities to acquire assets of outreach lab operations from hospitals whose in-house labs have expanded from supporting in-patients to supporting out-patients and ambulatory patients who see physicians affiliated with the hospital.\nWe also have joint venture arrangements with leading hospitals and health systems.\nThese joint venture arrangements, which provide diagnostic information services for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated clinicians and other local healthcare providers, serve as our principal facilities in their service areas.\nTypically, we have either a majority ownership interest in, or day-to-day management responsibilities for, our joint venture relationships.\nPatients and Consumers\nWe have taken steps to be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of choice of diagnostic information services.  Patients increasingly expect their healthcare experiences to be consumer-centric, which includes being more transparent,\n2\naccessible and convenient.\nMost patients have a choice when selecting a diagnostic testing provider, and our goal is to provide leading services in conveniently located patient service centers that can provide a comprehensive suite of testing services.\nMany of our 2,000 patient service centers are located inside large retail stores or in convenient retail settings across the United States.\nWe continue to enhance our operations to improve the patient experience in these locations.\nFor example, our \"Schedule at Check In\" capability encourages patients to make appointments, which allows us to better manage demand and productivity and has reduced average wait times in the patient service centers.  We also now provide mobile phlebotomy services in many parts of the United States so patients who prefer an in-home blood draw may access services for a fee.\nWe are also making investments to improve the consumer digital experience, from locating a patient service center to receiving results on our MyQuest\n®\npatient healthcare portal.\nWe are also building the patient payment process into the digital customer experience, which not only improves the patient experience, but also helps our patient concession rate and reduces demands on phlebotomists.\nIn response to the growing consumer desire to be more directly involved in and have more control over their health outcomes, we provide our QuestHealth.com platform to allow health-minded consumers to purchase testing directly from us without first having to make a doctor’s appointment.\nConsumers who want to evaluate their health or monitor certain chronic conditions, such as diabetes or hepatitis, as well as those seeking privacy can use these self-directed options to identify and  more frequently monitor health issues than their health plan or other payer may be willing to reimburse.\nA third-party physician reviews test orders and is available to consult with the consumer via a teleconsult about their test results.\nOur QuestHealth\nTM\noffering reflects our belief that by building on the foundation of our strong consumer focus we can capture growing opportunities in consumer-initiated testing and demand for expanded access to basic healthcare services.\nWe also provide opportunities for companies with telehealth and retail business models to rebrand our testing and utilize our patient service centers to provide access.\nOther Customer Channels\nOur other customer channels include health plans, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories, which are described in more detail under “ – Customer Channels”.\nWhile we principally focus on the U.S. market, we serve customers globally and have a growing business that provides advanced reference testing to laboratory providers in other countries.\nFor more information about our operations, see “ – Business Operations”.\nAdvanced Diagnostics\nWe support the needs of all our customers with a focus on Advanced Diagnostics™.\nClinical laboratory testing can be characterized as routine, non-routine or advanced.\nNon-routine tests are tests that may require professional “hands-on” attention from highly-skilled technical personnel, generally require more sophisticated data analysis, technology, equipment or materials, may be performed less frequently than routine tests and may be reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests.\nSome non-routine tests are advanced (“Advanced Diagnostics™”).\nAdvanced Diagnostics™ includes certain procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics (including next-generation sequencing), oncology, neurology, companion diagnostics and non-invasive pre-natal and other germline genetic testing.\nWe are a leading provider of Advanced Diagnostics™.\nOur investments in our Advanced Diagnostics™ offerings enhance our innovation capabilities and strengthen our service offering, making our Advanced Diagnostics™ offerings more attractive and accessible to physicians and hospitals.\nWe are also seeking to apply the capabilities gained by these efforts to support other areas where we can make a meaningful difference in healthcare, including offerings to pharmaceutical companies and\nconsumers.\nWe provide an array of Advanced Diagnostics™ offerings across the spectrum, including in high growth areas such as Molecular Genomics and Oncology.\nWe have a portfolio of oncology tests that includes traditional oncology screening and anatomic pathology, such as cervical cancer and skin cancer screening and diagnosis.  We are also well positioned to take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing to grow our business in cancer and other disease state testing.  This includes inherited genetics, newborn screening, and rare disease diagnosis, and solid tumor sequencing, such as to aid treatment selection and monitoring.\n3\nWe are also particularly focused on the rapidly growing areas of monitoring recurrence and therapy effectiveness.\nIn 2023, we acquired Haystack Oncology, Inc. (\"Haystack Oncology\") a cancer testing company that has developed a highly sensitive testing technology for detecting minimal-residual disease (“MRD”) by circulating tumor DNA due to residual or recurring cancer.  Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) refers to tiny molecules of cancer shed by a solid tumor, such as colorectal or breast cancer, into the blood stream. We believe this acquisition positions us well to compete in the higher-growth clinical area of ctDNA solid-tumor MRD testing.  In 2023, we also launched our  QUEST AD-DETECT\n®\ntest portfolio for assessing Alzheimer's disease risk using blood specimens, as opposed to testing by more costly or invasive methods, such as testing of cerebral spinal fluid by lumbar puncture.\nAcquisitions and Capital Deployment\nOur strategy includes generating growth through value-creating, strategically aligned acquisitions using disciplined investment criteria.\nWe screen potential acquisitions using guidelines that assess strategic fit and financial considerations, including value creation, return on invested capital and impact on our earnings.\nWe endeavor to grow revenues each year by 1-2% through acquisitions.\nWe will continue to invest in our business in a disciplined manner, including focusing on enhancing our solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities.\nIn 2023, we acquired Haystack Oncology, as well as certain assets of the laboratory services business of NewYork-Presbyterian, one of the nation's largest and most comprehensive academic medical centers.\nWe also completed our acquisition of select assets of Northern Light Laboratory, the outreach laboratory services business of Northern Light Health, a large integrated\nhealthcare\nsystem in Maine.\nOur significant acquisitions in each of the last three years are further discussed in Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Report).\nAcquisitions are part of our disciplined capital deployment framework, which also includes investment in our business, dividends and share repurchases and is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating.\nWe expect to return a majority of our free cash flow to stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nConsistent with that expectation, in February 2024, we announced that we increased our quarterly common stock cash dividend by approximately 5.6%, from $0.71 per common share to $0.75 per common share.  This represents our 13\nth\nincrease in the dividend since the beginning of 2012.\nFor many years, we have maintained a common stock repurchase program.\nSince the beginning of 2012, we have returned approximately $7.5 billion to stockholders through repurchases of our common stock.\nOUR STRENGTHS\nContinuous Quality Improvement\nOur goal is to provide every patient and customer with services and products of superior quality.\nWe strive to accomplish that through rigorous processes that we measure and seek to improve, and by using the Quest Management System, which provides best-in-class business performance tools to create and implement effective and sustainable quality processes.\nOur Quality Program includes policies and procedures to document, measure and monitor the effectiveness of our laboratory operations in providing and improving quality and meeting applicable regulatory requirements.\nThe Quality Program is designed so that the quality of laboratory services is monitored objectively and evaluated systematically to deliver superior quality care, identify opportunities to improve patient care and resolve identified problems.\nTo help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the diagnostics information services industry, we have implemented our Quality System Framework, which serves as a reference guide for our employees and describes our Quality System Elements, which provide the structure for each laboratory to achieve and maintain quality processes.\nWe also have a robust Supplier Quality Program designed to help us ensure we have a high-quality supplier network and to raise the bar of quality expectations across that network.\nOperating Efficiency\nWe strive to enhance operational excellence and improve our efficiency across our value chain and operations, from the time that we first interact with a potential customer until the time we receive payment for our services.\nImproving our operations can yield many benefits, including improving our quality and competitiveness, strengthening our foundation for growth, and increasing employee engagement and shareholder value.  We are guided by a service dashboard that focuses throughout our operations on quality for consumers, healthcare providers and employees, including medical quality, on-time delivery, competitive costs and employee safety.\n4\nOur cost excellence program, Invigorate, includes structured plans to drive savings and improve productivity across the value chain, including in such areas as patient services, logistics and laboratory operations, revenue services, information technology (\"IT\") and procurement.\nOur Invigorate program has consistently delivered 3% of annual cost savings and productivity improvements, year in and year out to partly offset pressures from the current inflationary environment, including labor and benefit cost increases, and reimbursement pressures.  We are leveraging automation and AI to improve productivity, and also improve quality across our entire value chain, not just in the laboratory.\nOther areas of focus include reducing denials and patient concessions, enhancing the digital experience, and selecting and retaining talent.\nOrganized to Drive Growth and Value\nWe strive to strengthen our organizational capabilities to align around growth opportunities, coordinate business units for seamless execution and leverage our company-wide infrastructure to gain more capability, value and efficiency.\nThe value creation side of our business includes product and commercial marketing and is organized by clinical franchise and focuses on customer solutions for the marketplace, including new test development and diagnostic insights.\nOur clinical franchises – Cardiometabolic, Endocrine, and Wellness (CMEW), Drug Monitoring and Toxicology, Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Molecular Genomics and Oncology, Neurology, and Women’s and Reproductive Health – enable us to perform like a boutique laboratory while maintaining our scale advantages, and work with our research and development and commercial organizations to identify and deliver new and improved solutions.\nThe value delivery side includes sales, laboratory operations, field operations, logistics and client services.\nAssets and Capabilities that Deliver Value\nWe collaborate with partners and customers across the healthcare ecosystem to help create a healthier world.  The table below outlines some of the assets and capabilities that make us an attractive partner.\n5\nStrong Relationships with Health Plans and Other Payers\nMost of the services we perform are paid for by commercial payers, including large national health plans, regional and local health plans and government payers, which includes Medicare and Medicaid.\nThrough these payers, we estimate that we have access to approximately 90% of insured lives in the United States.\nWe work with payers to reduce the cost of care, improve the customer experience and drive better outcomes for patients.\nWe can strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of our services for their members by focusing on driving value and providing strong value propositions for members and physicians.\nFor example, we build information platforms to help health plans manage utilization and population health, keep laboratory testing in network and provide an alternative to high-cost labs.\nWe also offer extended care services to help close gaps in care designed to be attractive to payers.\nInnovation\nWe are a leading provider of innovation in diagnostic information services that help healthcare market participants care for their patients through better testing for predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices, and that can deliver high clinical value to the medical community and reduce the overall cost of healthcare.\nWe develop and introduce new tests through our research and development operations.\nOur capabilities include discovery, technology development and clinical validation of diagnostic tests.\nWe also partner with other developers of new technologies, services and tests to transfer their innovations to the marketplace, using our in-house expertise (\ne.g.\n, strength in new service development and commercialization of testing services).\nThese developers include large commercial manufacturers, the academic community, pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, emerging medical technology companies, other laboratory companies and others that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics, pharmaceutical and device technologies.\nGiven our expertise and broad U.S. network, we believe we are the distribution channel of choice for developers of new diagnostic information solutions.\nOur innovation strategy focuses on new services and solutions for unmet clinical needs that will improve patient care and outcomes as well as economic value for patients, health plans and other payers.  We believe our research and development team includes several leaders in a number of fields, including in genomics, genetics and bioinformatics, as well as in disease states, such as oncology, neurology, cardiometabolic disease and other disorders.  We also maintain relationships with advisers and consultants who are leaders in key fields of science and medicine who advise us with our internal team of experts, complementing our expertise.\nWe endeavor to improve test processes, including through increased automation.\nIn addition, we aim to develop holistic solutions responsive to challenges that healthcare providers and patients face, by developing solutions of tests, information and services focused on specific clinical challenges.\nWe look to offer solutions from our large dataset and data analytics capabilities to help providers and health plans identify opportunities to optimize appropriate laboratory utilization, align clinical practice to medical guidelines, and inform patient-care decisions.\nWe also look for innovations and solutions that are more convenient, less invasive and more cost effective than currently available options.\nWe seek innovation in the ways we bring solutions to customers, and in the customer experience, including enhanced services and end-to-end solutions for convenience and support.\nMedical and Scientific Expertise\nWe have strong medical and scientific expertise and aspire to be a trusted authority in diagnostic medicine, provide insights and tools to support public and personal health, lead and facilitate scientific discussion and inspire innovation.\nOur medical and scientific experts regularly provide presentations, symposia and webinars regarding diagnostic testing and participate on scientific committees determining guidelines for diagnostic usage.\nThey also publish research that demonstrates the clinical value and importance of diagnostic testing, including in connection with our research and development efforts, in peer-reviewed journals, textbooks and other publications.\nFor over 30 years, the Company has published the Quest\n6\nDiagnostics\n®\nDrug Testing Index,\nTM\na series of reports on national workplace drug positivity trends based on the Company's employer workplace drug testing data, that is widely cited by employers, the federal government and the media to help identify and quantify drug abuse among the nation's workforce.\nThe Company also publishes Quest Diagnostics\n®\nHealth Trends,\n®\na series of scientific reports that provide insights into health topics, based on analysis of objective clinical laboratory data, to empower better patient care, population health management and public health policy.\nIn 2023, we published Health Trends\n®\nreports on lipid- associated risk of cardiovascular disease and, with the Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (“CDC”), on hepatitis C infections in the United States.\nOur annual Health Trends report on clinical drug testing revealed potentially dangerous mixing of the opioid fentanyl and the horse tranquilizer xylazine in clinically drug tested patients.\nWe are a founding member, with other leading diagnostic laboratories outside the United States, of the Global Diagnostics Network\nTM\n,\na strategic working group of diagnostic laboratories committed to unleashing and sharing local innovation to increase global access to diagnostic science, information and services and generating enhanced diagnostic insights to improve the delivery of global healthcare.\nWith researchers from Johns Hopkins University and the other laboratories participating in the Global Diagnostics Network, we produced the largest analysis of cholesterol lipid levels, based on nearly half a billion de-identified, aggregated test results, to illuminate trends in cardiovascular disease in the United States and sixteen other countries.\nHealth Information Technology Solutions and Information Assets\nWe have a history of providing leading IT for diagnostic information services, including for patients, physicians and healthcare organizations. We were the first national diagnostic information services provider to offer online patient appointment scheduling and a patient connectivity solution.\nOur MyQuest\n®\npatient healthcare portal, with more than 32.9 million registered users at year-end 2023, enables patients to manage healthcare and medical information for themselves and a circle of others, find a Quest Diagnostics location, schedule appointments, receive appointment reminders, assess whether their health plan is in-network and receive and archive their test results.\nIndividuals can also use their smartphone or computer to order a consumer-initiated test from us at QuestHealth.com.

Our Diagnostic Solutions group includes our risk assessment services business, which offers solutions for insurers, and our healthcare IT businesses, which offers solutions for healthcare providers and payers.  Our services primarily are provided under the Quest Diagnostics brand, but we also provide services under other brands, including AmeriPath,\n®\nDermpath Diagnostics,\n®\nExamOne,\n®\nand Quanum.\n®\nWe are a leading provider of diagnostic information services in the United States, where we conduct substantially all of our business.\nWe see opportunities to bring our experience and expertise in diagnostic information services to markets outside the United States, including leveraging existing facilities to serve new markets.\nDiagnostic Information Services\nBackground - clinical testing.\nClinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services.  Clinical testing is used for predisposition, screening, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and treatment choices of diseases and other medical conditions.  Clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services.\nClinical laboratory testing, which can be characterized as routine, non-routine or advanced, generally is performed on whole blood, serum, plasma and other body fluids, such as urine, and specimens such as microbiology samples.  Clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine.  Routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney, heart, liver, thyroid and other organs.  Commonly ordered routine tests include blood chemistries, urinalysis, allergy tests and complete blood cell counts.  Non-routine tests may require professional “hands-on” attention from highly-skilled technical personnel, generally require more sophisticated data\n8\nanalysis, technology, equipment or materials, may be performed less frequently than routine tests and may be reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests.  It may not be practical, from a cost-effectiveness or infrastructure perspective, for many hospitals, ACOs, commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of non-routine tests, or to perform low-volume non-routine testing in-house.  Such tests generally are outsourced to a clinical testing laboratory which can perform these non-routine tests.  Some non-routine tests are Advanced Diagnostics.  Advanced Diagnostics™ includes certain procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics (including next-generation sequencing), oncology, neurology, companion diagnostics and non-invasive pre-natal and other germline genetic testing.\nAnatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients.\nOur services.\nWe provide information and insights based on an industry-leading menu of routine, non-routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services.  We have strong testing capabilities, including services for the predisposition, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers and other diseases, and offer advanced tests in many fields, including endocrinology, immunology, neurology and oncology.  Increasingly, we are focused on providing solutions and insights to our customers, based on the testing that we perform, the data that we gather and our extensive medical, information and connectivity assets.  We believe that offering services, solutions and insights based on a full range of tests, information assets and other capabilities strengthens our market offering, market position and reputation.\nWe offer broad access to clinical testing through a nationwide network of laboratories, including advanced laboratories as well as rapid response laboratories (smaller facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated menu of routine tests for customers that require rapid turnaround times).  We operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Our nationwide network also includes patient service centers, phlebotomists in physician offices, and our connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile phlebotomists, nurses and other health and wellness professionals.  Our large in-house staff of medical and scientific experts, including medical directors, scientific directors, genetic counselors and board-certified geneticists, provide medical and scientific consultation to healthcare providers and patients regarding our tests and test results, and help them best utilize our services to improve outcomes and enhance satisfaction.  We also provide testing (including anatomic pathology) services and medical director services at hospital laboratories.\nWe are a leading provider of diagnostic information services for infectious disease, such as tuberculosis (\ne.g.\n, our T.SPOT.\nTB\nand Quantiferon offerings) and tick-borne disease (\ne.g.\n, our Accutix™ offering).  We strive to be the first to provide diagnostic solutions for emerging infectious diseases (\ne.g\n., our offerings for mpox virus).  We have comprehensive offerings in drug monitoring and toxicology, in neurology diagnostics, in advanced cardiovascular diagnostic information services (\ne.g\n., our CARDIO IQ\n®\nand Cleveland HeartLab™\nofferings through our Cardiometabolic Center of Excellence\nTM\n), and in cancer diagnostics .  We also provide workplace drug testing services, testing urine, hair, and oral fluid specimens, and are certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to perform drug testing using electronic custody and control forms for federally-mandated, safety-sensitive workers.\nWe offer a wide range of employer population health services, including biometric screenings, flu shots and related preventative services that leverage clinical data to improve population health outcomes and reduce healthcare spend.  Our solutions enable employers to leverage screening insights to identify chronic disease risks, guide employees to needed in-network care, and improve employee health with intervention services.  Our offerings include connecting participants to the right care at the right time, such as (i) a program designed to prevent diabetes and other chronic conditions, (ii) a program that enables participants to engage with a board-certified physician about their results and be guided to the right next action based on those results,  (iii) a health coaching program to help individuals adopt healthier behaviors to improve health outcomes and (iv) a program to facilitate virtual telehealth access to clinical services for participants and adult dependents, with emphasis on reducing risks related to preventable chronic diseases.  These services are sold directly to employers, through resellers and health plan partners.\nWe offer health IT solutions, including our products and national healthcare provider network, to help healthcare organizations and clinicians empower better health by leveraging the power of our significant information assets, including many years of test result data, and our technology prowess, including our history of providing leading IT for diagnostic information services.  Our portfolio of offerings is designed to address analytic, clinical and financial needs.  The solutions help healthcare organizations and clinicians analyze and put in context data, and enable them to connect across the healthcare system and engage with their stakeholders.  They can enter, share and access clinical information without costly IT implementation or significant workflow disruption.\n9\nWe offer population health solutions to clinicians, health plans, and hospitals.  Our services build on the power of our information assets and data capabilities and help our customers deliver better care to their patient populations by identifying gaps in care in a population, providing clinical solutions to close the gaps and fostering consumer engagement with a solution.  For example, Quest\n®\nLab Stewardship\nTM\nemploys machine learning to help clinicians optimize medically-appropriate laboratory test utilization.  Our extended care services (\ne.g\n., home collection kits for lab testing) help deliver better care to patient populations by identifying and filling gaps in care for patient populations and by enabling delivery of the most effective healthcare to the right populations and individuals.  These services leverage the power of our assets (\ne.g.\n, our extensive clinical data and data analytics services) and capabilities (\ne.g\n., call centers, patient service centers, mobile workforce) and focus on extending the reach of clinician offices beyond their traditional four walls to assess the health of their populations, and doing so when it is convenient for consumers.  Once gaps are identified, we engage patients in our retail sites, in home or by telephone, including through our call centers and our mobile capabilities, including highly trained healthcare professionals.  In 2022, we enhanced our extended care offering by acquiring Pack Health, LLC (\"Pack Health\") which offers patient engagement services that help individuals adopt healthier behaviors to improve outcomes.\nWe offer services to pharmaceutical companies, including clinical trials testing, and have expertise in developing laboratory tests for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) submission as companion diagnostics and laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”) for complementary diagnostics, and offer an array of assets and services to support the development of companion diagnostics, including our robust data set and patient services network.  We also offer Quest Clinical Trials Connect™ to help accelerate clinical trials (and thus the speed of drugs to market) through better patient recruitment, involvement and management, and improved physician outreach.  We also offer Pack Health's patient engagement services to our pharma clients.\nDiagnostic Solutions\nOur risk assessment service, ExamOne\n®\nis the largest provider of risk assessment services to the life insurance industry in North America and comprises underwriting support services, including data gathering, paramedical examinations and clinical laboratory testing and analytics, designed to assist life insurance companies objectively to evaluate the mortality risks of applicants.

Healthcare organizations use Quanum\n®\nEnterprise Content Solutions™ at approximately 745 sites in North America.\nTHE CLINICAL TESTING INDUSTRY\nKey Trends\nThe healthcare system in the United States continues to evolve and industry change is likely to be extensive.  Because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term.  There are a number of key trends that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the growth and the nature of the diagnostic information services business in the United States and on our business.  These trends, discussed in the table below, present both opportunities and risks.  We believe that several of the trends, including consolidation, price transparency and consumerization, are favorable to our business.\n10\n11\n12\n13\nWe believe that these changing market fundamentals will benefit lower-cost, high-value providers like Quest, and that we are well positioned to grow from the changing market conditions and benefit from the long-term growth expected in the industry.\nCustomer Channels\nWe provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers within our primary customer channels of physicians, hospitals, and patients and consumers.\nIn many cases, the individual that orders our services is not responsible for paying for these services.\nIncreasingly, patients are bearing greater responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them, even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment.\nIn addition, consumers are more frequently requesting and paying for tests themselves.\nIn the table below, we provide a summary of our different customer channels.\nFor more information on our growth strategy supporting these customer channels, see above under the heading “Our Strategy\".\n14\n15\nHealth Plans, Government Agencies and Other Payers\nMost of the services we perform are paid for by commercial payers, including large national health plans, managed care organizations and other health insurance providers, regional and local health plans and government payers, which includes Medicare and Medicaid.\nThese customers typically reimburse us as a contracted (or out-of-network) provider for services rendered to their members.\nIn certain locations, health plans may delegate to Independent Physician Associations (“IPAs”) or other alternative delivery systems (\ne.g.\n, physician organizations, ACOs, patient-centered medical homes) the ability to negotiate for diagnostic information services on behalf of certain members.\nIncreasingly, these customers are interested in value-based arrangements.\nHealth plans and IPAs often require that diagnostic information services providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing such services through capitated payment arrangements.\nUnder capitated payment arrangements, we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member, generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us.\nUnder some capitated programs, we may provide certain services on a negotiated fee-for-service basis.\nReimbursement under programs that do not provide for capitated payments is typically negotiated on a fee-for-service basis.\nReimbursement from our five largest health plans totaled approximately 20%, and no one health plan accounted for 10%, of our consolidated net revenues in 2023.\nHealth plans typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of diagnostic information services providers, and represent approximately one-half of our total clinical testing volume and > 40% of our net revenues from diagnostic information services.\nThere has been a trend of consolidation among health plans.  Some health plans also have narrowed their provider networks.  In addition, some health plans have established \"preferred provider\" networks within their broader networks (e.g., UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network), in effect distinguishing among contracted providers.\nWe are also sometimes a member of a “complementary network.”\nA complementary network generally is a set of contractual arrangements that a third party maintains with various providers that provide discounted fees for the benefit of its customers.\nA member of a health plan\n16\nmay choose to access a non-contracted provider that is a member of a complementary network; if so, the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network.\nWe offer to health plans services and programs that leverage our Company's expertise and resources, including our superior patient access, extensive test menu, medical staff, data, IT solutions, and wellness and population health management capabilities.\nFor the last few years, our Company has had access to a very high percentage of the insured lives in the United States, including very strong access in key high-population states.\nWe believe that this strong access increases our attractiveness to other customer channels, including physicians, patients and employers.\nWe also provide services on a fee-for-service basis to federal, state and local governmental agencies.\nHistorically, most Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the federal government.\nOver the last several years, the federal government has expanded its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs, called “Medicare Advantage” programs.\nThere has been growth of health insurance providers offering Medicare Advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs.\nStates also have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.\nWe also provide additional services to and in conjunction with government agencies across the United States.\nFor example, in 2023, we formed a novel collaboration with the CDC to research the disease burden of hepatitis C virus in the United States based on our laboratory testing.\nCompetition\nWhile there has been consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years, which we expect to continue, our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive.\nWe primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: other commercial clinical laboratories, including smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories.\nOur largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Inc.\nWe also compete with other providers, including large physician group practices and providers of consumer-initiated testing.\nIn anatomic pathology, we compete with anatomic pathology practices, including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices, and providers of emerging digital pathology solutions.  Some physician practices establish their own histology laboratory capabilities and/or bring pathologists into their practices, thereby reducing referrals from these practices and increasing the competitive position of these practices.\nHospitals generally maintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients (inpatient or outpatient).\nIn addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing.\nHospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital's laboratory.\nAs a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing.\nIn addition, hospitals may have more, or more convenient, locations in a market.\nHospitals that own physician practices may encourage or require the practices to refer testing to the hospital's laboratory.\nIn recent years, there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals.\nIncreased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position.\nThe formation of ACOs and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services.\nIn addition, new players have recently started to provide clinical lab testing services (\ne.g\n., employers; government agencies) and market activity may continue to increase the competitive environment.\nWe believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry, including the most comprehensive test menu, innovative test offerings, a positive customer experience, a staff including medical and scientific experts, high quality, leading access and distribution, and data-powered integrated IT solutions provide us with a competitive advantage. We believe that as a large diagnostic information services provider we can serve our customers more effectively due to our larger network and lower cost structure.  In addition, market activity may increase the competitive environment.\nThe diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology, new product introductions and new service offerings. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing.  Digital pathology, still in an emerging state, is an example of this.  Competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings.  Competitors also may offer new testing services that can be performed outside of a commercial\n17\nclinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be administered by physicians in their offices, complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories, and home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.\nThe risk assessment and healthcare IT industries are highly competitive.  We have many competitors, some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources.  We compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a wider array of quality, integrated services than our competitors, faster services completion and a superior applicant experience.  We compete in the healthcare IT industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers, particularly smaller and medium sized physician practices.\nGENERAL\nHuman Capital Management.\nIn 2023 we introduced The Quest Way, which has three core components: Our Purpose: why we exist; our Strategy: how we grow; and our Culture: how we work. Our focus on delivering across The Quest Way drives our approach to human capital management.  Effectively managing our human capital resources is a priority with key components that include culture, safety and well-being programs, inclusion, diversity, and employee engagement, and attracting, training, development and succession planning.  Our Board of Directors oversees our human capital management, including by receiving management reports on key areas, strategies, and initiatives. In 2023, our Board of Directors renamed the Compensation Committee the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and revised the committee’s charter to include leadership development for senior management other than the Chief Executive Officer, as a committee responsibility. Additional information about our human capital management strategies and initiatives is available in our annual corporate responsibility report.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have approximately 48,000 employees, of whom approximately 40,000 are full-time and the remainder are part-time or on-call.  Our employee population is more diverse than the U.S. workforce, taken as a whole. Approximately 72% of our employees globally identify as women; approximately 50% of our U.S. employees identify as people of color.  A majority of our employees work directly with our customers or in our laboratories.  Fewer than 1% of our employees are represented by a union.  We believe that our overall relations with our employees are good.\nCulture\n.  We foster a strong culture, built on our Code of Ethics, which reinforces our commitment to integrity and aligns with our Purpose and brand. In 2023, we introduced The Quest Way and the 5Cs of Culture —Customer First, Care, Curiosity, Collaboration and Continuous Improvement—to define the behaviors we value and aspire to, every day. The 5Cs are integrated into our daily management practices, including recognition and performance reviews, to encourage all employees to embody the 5Cs in their daily activities.\nOur Quest Management System, supports our effort to maintain a focus on high performance.  We also focus on building and maintaining a collaborative, diverse and inclusive culture in which all employees are empowered to raise and discuss difficult issues and are valued for their strengths, experience and unique perspectives (our focus on diversity and inclusion is discussed further below).  We encourage our employees to actively participate in their communities, and support their participation,through our Employee Business Networks and Matching Gift Program.  Our Everyday Excellence program includes guiding principles for our entire organization to support a superior customer experience and inspire employees to be their best every day, with every person and with every customer interaction; the program is integrated into performance assessments and frontline employee behavioral standards. Our Recognition Quest Program reinforces our commitment to recognize above and beyond contributions and to demonstrating how much we value, care for and appreciate one another by regularly celebrating and rewarding one another as we work together.\nSafety and Well-Being\n.  The health and safety of our employees is of paramount concern. We use a systematic, risk-based approach to develop tailored incident prevention and response programs designed to keep our employees safe in each of our diverse functional areas and use data insights and a detailed audit program to foster the effectiveness of our programs. We have a comprehensive curriculum of annual safety training, as well as training for new employees. As part of our comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits program, we also offer innovative initiatives to support the well-being of our employees and their families through our HealthyQuest™ program. The cornerstone of HealthyQuest™ is our Blueprint for Wellness\n®\nprogram, which empowers our employees and their spouses and partners with health insights based on lab and biometric data and invites them each year to take the initiative to improve their physical and mental health. We also offer comprehensive medical and mental health plans.  For example, our mental health support service, launched in 2022, continues to be widely used among our employees and their dependents.  HealthyQuest™ focuses on prevention, progression\n18\nand reversal, through which we offer a HealthyQuest™ Employee Business Network and intervention programs designed to engage employees in managing their health, including access to medical expertise and support programs tailored to their individual needs, helping them to adopt healthier behaviors and access better care at lower costs.  These programs include customized programs for conditions such as type 2 diabetes management, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, specialty drugs, and zero-cost lab testing, and special support for orthopedic surgery and for cancer and other serious diagnoses.\nInclusion and Diversity\n.  We understand the need to create an environment where employees can bring their whole selves to work, and our Everyday Equity philosophy embodies our commitment to promote inclusion and embrace diversity by consistently inviting new perspectives and exploring new experiences.  We aim to harness the unique mix of capabilities, talents, cultures, beliefs and experience of our employees and create a workforce that is demographically diverse at all levels of the organization.  Through our focus on Culture, Talent and Community, we prioritize diversity across the entire talent lifecycle, with the goals of supporting employees throughout their careers at Quest, ensuring transparency and identifying opportunities for action.  In 2023, we expanded our focus on inclusion and diversity through leadership training programs like McKinsey Connected Leaders Academy, Franklin Covey’s Leading at the Speed of Trust, and a Mentoring Circles program focused on developing inclusive leadership competencies in front line supervisors.  Additionally, we launched an Everyday Equity Council comprised of diverse leaders from our Employee Business Networks to offer regular feedback to organizational leaders on opportunities to further enhance inclusivity of programs, policies, and services. Our employee engagement on Inclusion and Diversity was also evidenced by the approximately 60% growth in Employee Business Network membership in 2023. We also continued, with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation, Quest for Health Equity\n®\n, our initiative to help reduce health disparities in underserved communities.  For more information about our Quest for Health Equity\n®\ninitiative, see \"-Our Strengths\".\nEngagement\n.  Actively listening to our employees is fundamental to Quest’s culture. We have always sought to foster the engagement  of our employees and take action to improve the employee experience, through the use of regular employee insight surveys.  Employee engagement has been a metric in the annual incentive plan for our executive officers since 2013. Since 2020, our strategy for gathering employee feedback utilizes more frequent employee insight surveys.  This approach is designed to build an agile culture, based on continuous feedback that fuels ongoing conversations about priorities, performance, opportunities and growth, to result in a higher performing organization and committed employees.  To gain deeper insights from our employees, we expanded our effort across the employee lifecycle, to gain the unique feedback of our new hires, newly acquired team members, and our departing colleagues.   In addition, we hold regular meetings among hundreds of company leaders to foster increased communication across the company regarding topics of concern to employees.\nAttracting, Training, Development and Succession Planning\n.  We have a strong program designed to attract a diverse, qualified work force that will assist us to achieve our business goals.  For example, we are partnering with universities and specialized healthcare schools to help build our pipeline of expertise in medical technology, cytology and histology, and we have teamed up with a third-party phlebotomy training program to train and certify phlebotomist candidates who can join our ranks upon graduation. In addition, we post all our jobs on a number of sites that specifically attract diverse talent. We provide training on a wide array of topics to our employees through live and online formats, including opportunities that can be accessed through their mobile devices.  We also offer a number of development opportunities for our employees through a robust library of offerings in our Learning Management System, EMPower. We also facilitate mentoring and education programs and a higher education tuition assistance program, My Quest for Education.  In addition, we provide leadership training opportunities for employees at all levels, including a manager essentials curriculum, our Leading Quest Supervisor and Manager Core Program, our director-level Leading Quest for Business Impact program, coaching programs and trainings to strengthen critical leadership skills.  We also deliver a number of programs tailored to specific functions to drive a high-performance culture and sharpen the capabilities needed to lead our organization (\ne.g\n., our Commercial, Finance, Pathology, R&D, and Product Management Leadership Programs). Quest’s robust talent review and succession planning process assesses current and future organizational needs in combination with the capabilities and aspirations of our employees to ensure we have the right talent, in the right roles, at the right time. For leaders, we have robust succession plans and leverage several inputs, inclusive of formal assessments, to inform customized development plans.\nSales and Marketing.\nOur Diagnostic Information Services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale of most of our services.  It coordinates closely with our clinical franchises (discussed above under the heading \"Organized to Drive Growth and Value\") and marketing organization.  The commercial organization is centrally led, and is organized regionally, in conjunction with our operations organization, to focus on local customer needs and to ensure aligned delivery for our customers.  Our commercial organization employs leading processes and tools and strong management discipline.  We provide industry-leading training and development, focus on opportunities with hospitals and specialty physicians, and foster a customer-focused, performance-driven culture.  We also maintain distinct sales and marketing organizations for our offerings in Diagnostic Solutions and our employer testing services.\n19\nInformation Technology.\nWe use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test ordering and reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of data.  We endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our Company and customers.  The successful delivery of our services depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems.  We take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our IT systems.\nSome of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and, as a result, we continue to use multiple information systems.  We have made significant progress implementing common systems in our regional laboratories, and we continue to standardize laboratory information and billing systems across our operations.  We expect that our standardization efforts will take several more years to complete, and will result in significantly more centralized systems, improved operating efficiency, more positive customer experiences and enhanced control over our operational environment.  Even after we complete our efforts to standardize our legacy systems, we will need to focus on standardizing systems in connection with future business acquisitions.\nQuality Assurance.\nAs discussed further under the heading \"Continuous Quality Improvement\", our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality, and to meet that goal we employ the Quest Management System.  Employing root cause analysis, process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring, we continuously seek to enhance quality, reduce defects, further increase the efficacy and efficiency of our operations and processes, eliminate waste and help standardize operations across our Company.\nIn our laboratory operations, our quality assurance efforts focus on pre-analytic, analytic and post-analytic processes, including positive patient identification of specimens, appropriate specimen transport, analysis and report accuracy, reference interval establishment and review, statistical process control and personnel training for our laboratories and patient service centers.  As part of our quality assurance program, we utilize internal proficiency testing, comprehensive quality control and rigorous process audits.  We have introduced comprehensive and digitized data analytics software that implements advanced automated quality control procedures, offering both real-time and post-analytic analysis of data at the laboratory and corporate level.  We monitor test results to identify trends, biases, instrument failures and population shifts through digitization and data analytics.  We also focus on the licensing, credentialing, training and competence of our professional and technical staff.  For example, our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peer-review evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs.\nWe have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations, such as CMS, The College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) and certain states.  All of our laboratories participate in external quality surveillance programs, including proficiency testing programs administered by CAP and several state agencies.  CAP is an independent, nongovernmental organization of board-certified pathologists approved by CMS to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (“CLIA”).  CAP offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe.  All of our major laboratories, including our laboratories outside the United States, and a number of our rapid response laboratories, are accredited by CAP.  Accreditation includes on-site inspections and participation in the CAP (or equivalent) proficiency testing program.  In addition, some of our laboratories also have International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification for their quality management systems.  For example, in 2022, we achieved ISO 14001 certification for our esoteric laboratory facility at San Juan Capistrano, CA.  ISO 14001 is an internationally recognized management system that leverages leadership involvement and employee engagement to help organizations ensure compliance with regulatory standards, improve their environmental performance, provide a competitive advantage and gain the trust of stakeholders, and achieve strategic goals by incorporating environmental issues into business management.\nWe maintain a robust Supplier Quality Program designed to ensure a high-quality supplier network and to raise the bar of quality expectation across that network.  We expect suppliers to provide the highest quality products and services and to embrace an ethic of transparent quality collaboration.  In our program, we aim to ensure and improve the quality of purchased products and services.  Our suppliers are expected to operate under quality management principles that meet industry standards, strive for zero defect manufacturing, use statistical analysis to reduce variation and meet applicable regulatory standards.  In choosing suppliers, we evaluate their quality systems and quality performance metrics.  Our supplier qualification process is risk-based, with assessments and on-site audits based on risk tiers and supplier quality management system compliance.  Contracts with our suppliers include specific quality, compliance, and change management provisions as appropriate.  We use supplier quality engineers who are trained to audit on ISO standards and FDA regulations applicable to suppliers’ processes, and a procurement engineering team to assist with qualification and validation of new supplies and products.  We actively manage supplier performance, utilizing a problem reporting and resolution process designed to drive to root cause and\n20\ncorrective actions.  We maintain a continuous improvement dialogue with our suppliers, and with operationally critical suppliers deliver a supplier scorecard that supports continuous improvement.\nWe also maintain quality assurance programs for hospital laboratories that we manage, and for our services offerings outside laboratories.\nIntellectual Property Rights.\nWe own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries.  From time to time, we also license patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights or trademarks owned by others; we also may license our intellectual property to others.  In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business.  We believe, however, that no single intellectual property asset is material to our business as a whole.  Our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets, to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise.  We actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products, processes and other intellectual property where possible.\nEnterprise Risk Management Program\n.  We maintain an enterprise risk management program, which is led by our executive leadership and overseen by our Board of Directors, that is designed to promote a culture of risk awareness throughout the Company's key business, operations and support functions.  Our program, which is integrated with the Company’s governance, performance management and internal control frameworks, entails a formal continuous process that identifies, assesses, mitigates and manages the risks from both internal and external conditions that could significantly impact the Company and influence its business strategy and performance, including environmental, social and governance issues.  The program, which is managed by an enterprise risk management team, is designed based on the most recent framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and we benchmark it against best practices.  We focus on the following risk types:\n•\nOperational risk - risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the Company’s operational objectives or fundamental reason for its existence, including: product life-cycle and execution; service quality and performance; information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity; supply chain and business disruption; and other risks, including human capital, reputation and environmental.\n•\nFinancial risk - risks arising from the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations pursuant to its strategic and operational objectives, including exposure to broad market and more specific industry risk that could impact liquidity, interest rate, credit, pricing and reimbursement, and also to internal and external financial reporting.\n•\nLegal and compliance risk - risks arising from the regulatory and enforcement environment, legal proceedings and adherence to ethics and compliance policies and procedures.\n•\nStrategic risk - risks that will impede the Company’s plan to achieve its Purpose and apply its core values, including changes in the broad market and Company's industry, business development and restructuring activities, competitive threats and practices, technology and product innovation, and public policy.\nAs part of our program, together with our Board of Directors, we routinely assess our enterprise level risks, emerging risks, overall Company-level risk tolerance and the effectiveness of risk management, and monitor the progress of and resources applied to risk mitigation.  Our Board of Directors and its committees receive updates and training from internal and external experts on topics that are relevant to overall risk management.  Our primary risk factors are discussed in \"Risk Factors\" below.\nBilling; Government Reimbursement.\nWe generally bill for diagnostic information services on a fee-for-service basis under one of two types of fee schedules; fees may be negotiated or discounted.  The types of fee schedules are:\n•\n“Client” fees charged to physicians, hospitals and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis and which are billed on a monthly basis.\n•\n“Patient” fees charged to individual patients and certain third-party payers on a claim-by-claim basis.\nBilling for diagnostic information services is very complicated.  Our customers have different billing requirements.  Some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers, and there are several other factors that complicate billing (\ne.g\n., disparity in coverage and information requirements among payers; incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians; and lack of access to patients before testing).\nWe maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing practices, and we audit our practices for compliance with applicable laws and regulations and internal policies and procedures.\n21\nWith regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries, we generally must bill Medicare directly and must accept the Medicare carrier's fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full.  In addition, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more (and in most instances, pay significantly less) than Medicare.\nCurrently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for diagnostic testing services reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, but generally does require a patient deductible and co-insurance for anatomic pathology services.\nPart B of the Medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients, including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local Medicare clinical testing fee schedules.\nHistorically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule established under that program have been subject to change, including each year.\nPursuant to PAMA, reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under Medicare were reduced during 2018 - 2020.\nUnfortunately, as a result of a flawed implementation of PAMA, the data collected did not accurately represent the laboratory market as required under PAMA.\nIndependent laboratories were overrepresented, and hospitals and physician office laboratories were underrepresented, making the first round of PAMA cuts too extreme and resulting in below market rates.\nPAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare CLFS for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates.\nPAMA's next data collection and reporting period have been delayed, most recently by federal legislation adopted in November 2023 (the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 2024), which further delayed the reimbursement rate reductions and reporting requirements until January 1, 2025; reimbursement rate reduction from 2025-27 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually.  Congress reintroduced federal legislation in 2023 (the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act), which, if enacted, would reform PAMA and create a true market-based CLFS.\n22\nREGULATION\n23\nCompliance\n.\nWe strive to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\nWe license and maintain appropriate accreditations for all of our laboratories and, where applicable, patient service centers, as required by federal and state agencies.\nWe have a long-standing and well-established compliance program.\nThe Quality and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees, and receives periodic management reports regarding, our compliance program.\nOur program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the implementation and observance of all applicable laws and regulations (including regarding billing and reimbursement, and privacy of protected health information and personally identifiable information) and Company policies.\nFurther, we conduct in-depth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations.\nWe conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures.\nAs an integral part of our billing compliance program, we investigate reported or suspected failures to comply with Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement requirements.  As a result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments, refunded the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action.\n24\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) maintains an internet site, www.sec.gov, that contains annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy and information statements and other information that issuers file electronically with the SEC.  We file reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC; they are publicly available at the SEC's internet site.\nOur internet address is www.QuestDiagnostics.com.  The information on or accessible through our website is not part of and is not incorporated by reference into this Report.  We make available free of charge, on or through our Investor Relations webpage (www.QuestDiagnostics.com/investor), our proxy statements, Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practical after such material is filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.\nWe also maintain a Corporate Responsibility webpage that provides information about our corporate responsibility program, including our focus on environmental, social and governance issues and our annual Corporate Responsibility Report.\n25\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n26\n27"

    "text": "You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of our securities.\nThe risks below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we presently deem immaterial, may also negatively impact us.\nOur business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or reputation , or the price of our common stock, could be materially impacted by any of these factors.\n28\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe U.S. healthcare system continues to evolve, and medical laboratory testing market fundamentals are changing, and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.\nThe U.S. healthcare system continues to evolve.  Significant change is taking place in the healthcare system, including as discussed above under the heading \"The Clinical Testing Industry\".  For example, value-based reimbursement is increasing (\ne.g.\n, UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network) and CMS has set goals for value-based reimbursement to be achieved by 2030.  Patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for, and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for, their healthcare.  Healthcare industry participants are evolving and consolidating.  Healthcare services increasingly are being provided by non-traditional providers (\ne.g\n., physician assistants), in non-traditional venues (\ne.g\n., retail medical clinics, urgent care centers) and using new technologies (\ne.g\n., telemedicine, digital pathology).  Utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services.\nIn addition, we believe that clinical testing market fundamentals are changing.  Pursuant to PAMA, reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under Medicare were reduced during 2018 - 2020.  Unfortunately, as a result of a flawed implementation of PAMA, the data collected did not accurately represent the laboratory market as required under PAMA.  Independent laboratories were overrepresented, and hospitals and physician office laboratories were underrepresented, making the first round of PAMA cuts too extreme and resulting in below market rates.  Congress reintroduced federal legislation in 2023 (the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act), which, if enacted, would reform PAMA and create a true market-based CLFS.  We also believe that health plans and consumers increasingly are focusing on driving better value in laboratory testing services.  We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive.\nThe clinical testing business is highly competitive, and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nThe clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry.  We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: other commercial clinical laboratories, including smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories.\nWe also compete with other providers, including anatomic pathology practices, large physician group practices and providers of consumer-initiated testing.\nHospitals generally maintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients (inpatient or outpatient).\nIn addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing.\nHospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital's laboratory.\nAs a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing.\nIn addition, hospitals that own physician practices may encourage or require the practices to refer testing to the hospital's laboratory.\nIn recent years, there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals.\nIncreased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position.\nThe formation of ACOs and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services.\nIn addition, new players have recently started to provide clinical lab testing services (\ne.g\n., employers; government agencies).\nThe diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions.\nCompetitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing.\nDigital pathology, still in an emerging state, is an example of this.\nCompetitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings.\nCompetitors also may offer new testing services that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be administered by physicians in their offices, complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories, and home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.\nGovernment payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including clinical testing services.\n29\nWe face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services.  One example of this is increased use of prior authorization requirements.  We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue.\nPursuant to PAMA, reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under Medicare were reduced during 2018 - 2020.\nUnfortunately, as a result of a flawed implementation of PAMA, the data collected did not accurately represent the laboratory market as required under PAMA.  Independent laboratories were overrepresented, and hospitals and physician office laboratories were underrepresented, making the first round of PAMA cuts too extreme and resulting in below market rates. PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare CLFS for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates.\nPAMA's next data collection and reporting period have been delayed, most recently by federal legislation adopted in November 2023 (the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 2024), which further delayed the reimbursement rate reductions and reporting requirements until January 1, 2025; reimbursement rate reduction from 2025-2027 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually.  Congress reintroduced federal legislation in 2023 (the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act), which, if enacted, would reform PAMA and create a true market-based CLFS.\nIn addition, CMS has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform. We also provide physician services that are reimbursed by Medicare under a physician fee schedule, which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis.  Medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures.\nIn addition, over the last several years, the federal government has expanded its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries, called “Medicare Advantage” programs, and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs.\nThere has been growth of health insurance plans offering Medicare Advantage programs, and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs.\nStates have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.\nIn addition, state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business, such as delaying payments, reducing reimbursement, restricting coverage eligibility, denying claims and service coverage restrictions.\nFurther, CMS has set goals for value-based reimbursement to be achieved by 2030.\nReimbursement for Medicare services also is subject to annual reduction under the Budget Control Act of 2011, and the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.\nFrom time to time, the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for Medicare beneficiaries while maintaining quality and access to care.  Congress periodically considers cost-saving initiatives.  These initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services, co-payments for clinical testing and further laboratory physician fee schedule reductions.\nOther steps taken to reduce utilization and reimbursement include requirements to obtain diagnosis codes to obtain payment, increased documentation requirements, limiting the allowable number of tests or ordering frequency, expanded prior authorization programs and otherwise increasing payment denials.\nSteps to reduce utilization and reimbursement also discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer.\nHealth plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services, including clinical testing services.\nWe face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including health plans, to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services.  Examples include increased use of prior authorization requirements and increased denial of coverage for services.  There is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models.  We expect continuing efforts by third-party payers, including in their rules, practices and policies, to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services.  ACOs and hospitals also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of, or reimbursement for, diagnostic information services.\nThe healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with clinical testing providers.  The increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency, insurer bargaining power and the potential\n30\nadverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with an insurer.  Health plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements.  Some health plans also are reviewing test coding, evaluating coverage decisions, requiring additional documentation for claims payment and requiring preauthorization of certain testing.  There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing.\nOther steps taken to reduce utilization and reimbursement include requirements to obtain diagnosis codes (which can be inconsistent between health plans and government payers) to obtain  payment, increased documentation requirements, limiting the allowable number of tests or ordering frequency, expanded prior authorization programs and otherwise increasing payment denials.\nSteps to reduce utilization and reimbursement also discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer.\nFailure to develop, or acquire licenses for, new tests, technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.\nThe diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions.  Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs.\nIn addition, they could introduce new tests, technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services.\nOur success in continuing to introduce new solutions, technology and services will depend, in part, on our ability to develop or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms.\nWe may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services.\nOther companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing, that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our tests or operate our business.\nWe also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements, and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests.\nIf we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, our research and development costs may increase as a result.\nIn addition, if we are unable to develop and introduce, or license, new solutions, technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities, our services may become outdated when compared with our competition.\nFailure to establish, and perform to, appropriate quality standards, or to assure that the appropriate standard of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services, could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation.\nThe provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks.  The services that we provide are intended to provide information in providing patient care.  Therefore, users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes.\nNegligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events.  We may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists, laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under our supervision.  We are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation.\nRISKS RELATED TO CHANGE IN PUBLIC POLICY\nAND THE REGULATORY AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENT\nWe are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities, and we may face substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be impacted, if we fail to comply.\nOur business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (including at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business.  While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been extensively interpreted by the courts, including, among other things, many of those relating to:\n•\nbilling and reimbursement of clinical testing;\n31\n•\ncertification or licensure of clinical laboratories;\n•\nthe anti-self-referral and anti-kickback laws and regulations;\n•\nthe laws and regulations administered by the FDA;\n•\nthe corporate practice of medicine;\n•\noperational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are accurate, reliable and timely;\n•\nphysician fee splitting;\n•\nrelationships with physicians and hospitals;\n•\nmarketing to consumers;\n•\nprivacy of patient data and other personal information;\n•\nsafety and health of laboratory employees; and\n•\nhandling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials.\nThese laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices.\nWe may not be able to maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected.\nWe regularly receive requests for information, and occasionally subpoenas, from governmental authorities.  We also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers.”\nThe federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud.\nLegislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.\nIn addition, the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nRegardless of merit or eventual outcome, these types of investigations and related litigation can result in:\n•\ndiversion of management time and attention;\n•\nexpenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, costs and payment of damages;\n•\nincreases to our administrative, billing or other operating costs;\n•\nlimitations on our ability to continue some of our operations;\n•\nenforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages;\n•\ndecreases to the amount of reimbursement related to diagnostic information services performed;\n•\nadverse effects to important business relationships with third parties;\n•\ndecreased demand for our services; and/or\n•\ninjury to our reputation.\nChanges in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted, or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs, delay, modification or withdrawal.  Such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives.\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted by the FDA's approach to regulation.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States  A number of tests we develop internally are offered as LDTs.  The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories.\n32\nAs the FDA moves to regulate more clinical laboratory testing, its approach to regulation is expected to impact industry practices and participants, new competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms.\nThe FDA and HHS have expressed views regarding the regulation of LDTs.\nLegislation introduced in Congress in 2022 and again in 2023 that would authorize the FDA to regulate LDTs has not become law.\nIn October 2023, the FDA announced a proposed rule that would broaden the definition of medical devices to include diagnostic tests and laboratories that develop them.\nPublication of a final rule initiates a four-year period for a staged process of compliance and submissions. The proposed rule could also impact a revitalization and passage of legislation that authorizes the FDA to regulate LDTs by amending the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIf either the rule or legislation were to become law, it could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulating LDTs in new ways, while creating new avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing.  New competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms.\nFailure to accurately bill for our services, or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business\n.\nBilling for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements.\nDepending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, clinicians, hospitals and employer groups.\nThe majority of billing and related operations for our Company are being provided by a third party under the Company's oversight.\nFailure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences, including civil and criminal fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims.\nCertain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act, including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed.\nThe qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act and similar provisions in certain state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers, private payers and/or patients alleging inappropriate billing practices.\nAlthough we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion.  The federal or state government may bring claims based on our current practices, which we believe are lawful.\nThe federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages and fines far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nWe believe that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud.\nLegislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.\nWe are subject to numerous political (including geopolitical), legal, operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways.\nOur international operations increase our exposure to risks inherent in doing business in non-U.S. markets, which may vary by market and include: intellectual property legal protections and remedies; weak legal systems which may, among other things, affect our ability to enforce contractual rights; trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, supply, reimbursement and marketing of products and services; existing and emerging data privacy regulations affecting the processing and transfer of personal data; emerging regulations relating to the use of AI; and challenges based on differing languages and cultures.  International operations also require us to devote management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, and to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights.  In addition, we may be subject to intellectual property litigation, and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, which could force us to do one or more of the following:\n•\ncease developing, performing or selling solutions or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n33\n•\nobtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right;\n•\nredesign or re-engineer our tests;\n•\nchange our business processes; or\n•\npay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys' fees, including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful.\nAdverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, among other things, disputes as to intellectual property, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid carriers.\nSome proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert management's attention from operations.\nThese proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nOur outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $4.7 billion of debt outstanding.  Other than credit facilities in the normal course of business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements in place or available.  Our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants.  These restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt.  We have obtained ratings on our public debt from Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings.  There can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency's judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our Company or our industry, so warrant.  If such ratings are lowered, our borrowing costs could increase.  Changes in our credit ratings, however, do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt.\nWe or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future.  Increases in interest rates may increase our financing costs making it more challenging for us to incur additional debt necessary to fund our operations and strategic objectives.Our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  If we incur additional debt, a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may need to seek additional financing.  In that case, it may be more difficult, or we may be unable, to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us.  As a result, we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic, industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nThe development of new technologies is rapidly changing diagnostic testing, which will impact the healthcare industry and the competitive environment.  The development of new, more cost-effective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients, which could accelerate the internalization of testing by hospitals or clinicians, could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.\nThe diagnostic information services industry is facing rapidly changing technology and innovations in product offerings, including technology that enables more convenient, accessible and cost-effective testing.  For example, digital pathology is an emerging technology that may change the practice of pathology and our role in it. Competitors also may offer new testing services that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be administered by physicians in their offices, complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories, and home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.  Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under CLIA and may be performed by consumers in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits. Additionally, some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services, including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures, such as dermatologists, gastroenterologists, urologists and oncologists, are consolidating, have added in-office histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site.  Hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing, including some non-routine and advanced testing.  These technological advances (and the ones yet to come) and the continued internalization of testing services may lead to the need for less frequent testing and/or less use of the testing services we offer.\n34\nWe have been and expect to continue to use AI technology in the testing services we offer.  The challenges with properly managing the development and use of these technological innovations could result in harm to our reputation, business or customers, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have been and expect to continue to use AI technology in our testing services, and we anticipate it will become increasingly important to us over time.  This technology, including generative AI, which is in its early stages of commercial implementation, presents a number of risks inherent in its use, including risks related to cybersecurity, privacy and data use practices.  Additionally, AI technology can create accuracy issues and other outcomes that could harm our customers and negatively impact our reputation and our business.  Further, our competitors may develop new testing services and other products relying on AI more rapidly or more successfully than us, which could hinder our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations.  Using AI successfully will require significant resources, including having the technical expertise required to develop, test and maintain AI-based testing services.  In addition, we anticipate that there will continue to be new regulatory requirements concerning the use of AI, which may aim to regulate, limit, or block the use of AI in our testing and other services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may hinder their usability or effectiveness.\nHardware and software failures or delays in our IT systems, including failures resulting from our systems conversions or otherwise, could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nIT systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data.  Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems.  A failure or delay in our IT systems could impede our ability to serve our customers and patients and protect their confidential data.  Despite redundancy and backup measures and precautions that we have implemented, our IT systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources, including the age of the technology, telecommunications or network failures, system conversion, standardization or modernization initiatives, human acts and natural disasters.  These issues can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with whom we do business and over which we have limited control.  Any disruption or failure of our IT systems could have a material impact on our ability to serve our customers and patients, including negatively affecting our reputation in the marketplace.\nOur business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to strengthen our efficiency.\nIt is important that we continue to strengthen our efficiency to promote our competitive position and enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of diagnostic information services, and to partly offset pressures from the current inflationary environment, including labor and benefit cost increases, and reimbursement pressures.\nOur business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies.\nIn our business, we collect, generate, process or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information.  If we do not use or adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal, state and international laws, or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be materially impaired, our reputation could suffer, and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation.  These issues can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with whom we do business and over which we have limited control.  In the event of a data security breach, we may be subject to notification obligations, litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions, and may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (a) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations thereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; (b) state laws (\ne.g.\n, California) and similar laws in other states; and (c) laws outside the United States, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and similar laws in other jurisdictions.\n35\nOur approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may not satisfy all our stakeholders.\nWe regularly assess opportunities and risks related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.  As part of this process, we make decisions related to ESG matters and may set goals and targets related to ESG matters.  We have a broad range of stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, patients and communities we serve, some of whom increasingly focus on ESG matters.  In addition, some of our stockholders, employees and patients may consider ESG factors in making investment, employment and service provider decisions.  Our ability to achieve the goals we may set related to ESG matters are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.  Despite our efforts, we may not achieve our ESG goals on the timetable we set or at all.  Additionally, certain of our stakeholders may not be satisfied with our decisions related to ESG matters, the goals we set regarding ESG matters, our progress towards these goals or the resulting outcomes.  This could lead to negative perceptions of, or loss of support for our business, difficulty recruiting or attracting new employees and our stock price being negatively impacted.\nThe IT systems that we rely on may be subject to unauthorized tampering, cyberattack or other security breach.\nOur IT systems have been and are subject to potential cyberattacks, tampering or other security breaches.  These attacks, if successful, could result in shutdowns or significant disruptions of our IT systems and/or in unauthorized persons exfiltrating and misappropriating intellectual property and other confidential information, including patient and employee data that we collect, transmit and store on and through our IT systems.\nExternal actors may develop and deploy viruses, other malicious software programs, ransomware attacks, AI, distributed denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm or obtain unauthorized access to our systems.  External actors may also deploy programs targeting our employees which are designed to attack our IT systems or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities through programs such as electronic spamming, phishing, smishing, spear phishing or similar tactics.  As a result of the difficulty in detecting many of these attacks, intrusions and breaches, failures or losses may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered or rectified, which could further increase these costs and consequences.\nAlthough the Company has robust security measures implemented, which are monitored and routinely tested both by internal resources and external parties, cybersecurity threats against us continue to evolve and may not be recognized until after an incident.  In August 2021, ReproSource, our subsidiary, experienced a data security incident in which an unauthorized party may have accessed or acquired protected health information and personally identifiable information of ReproSource patients (in connection with the incident, ReproSource discovered and contained ransomware).  The Company’s other systems were not impacted or compromised by this incident.  Although the attacks we have experienced have not materially disrupted, interrupted, damaged or shutdown the Company's IT systems, or materially disrupted the Company's performance of its business, the mitigation or remediation efforts that we have undertaken, and may undertake in the future, require the attention of management and expenditures of resources, which can be significant.  There can be no assurance that the Company can anticipate all evolving future attacks, viruses or intrusions, implement adequate preventative measures, or remediate any security vulnerabilities.  If our IT systems are successfully attacked, it could result in major disruption of our business, compromise confidential information, and result in litigation and potential liability for the Company, government investigation, significant damage to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, third parties to whom we outsource certain of our services or functions, or with whom we interface, store or process confidential patient and employee data or other confidential information, as well as those third parties’ providers, are also subject to the risks outlined above.  For example, in June 2019, the Company reported that Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc./American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA), informed the Company about a data security incident involving AMCA.  AMCA, which provided debt collection services for a company that provides revenue management services to the Company, informed the Company in May 2019 that AMCA had learned that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA’s system during 2018 and 2019.  AMCA’s affected system included financial, medical and other personal information.  The Company’s systems or databases were not involved in this incident.  A breach or attack affecting third parties with whom we engage could also harm our business, results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability.\nWe have taken, and continue to take, precautionary measures to reduce the risk of, and detect and respond to, future cybersecurity threats, and prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our IT systems, including the loss or theft of intellectual property, patient and employee data or other confidential information that we obtain and store on our systems.  We also have taken, and will continue to take, measures to assess the cybersecurity protections used by third parties to whom we outsource certain of our services or functions, or with whom we interface, store or process confidential patient and employee data or other confidential information.  In addition, we collaborate with government agencies regarding potential cybersecurity threats and have worked with firms that have cyber security expertise to evaluate our systems and the attacks we experience and strengthen\n36\nour systems.  There can be no assurances that our precautionary measures or measures used by our third-party providers will prevent, contain or successfully defend against cyber or information security threats that could have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees and maintain good relations with our employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nThe supply of qualified technical, professional, managerial and other personnel, including cytotechs, phlebotomists and specimen processors, is currently constrained; competition for qualified employees, even across different industries, is intense, including as individuals leave the job market.  We may lose, or fail to attract and retain, key management personnel, or qualified skilled technical, professional or other employees.\nIn addition, we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good.  However, unfavorable labor environments, unionization activity, or a failure to comply with labor or employment laws could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns by the affected workers, fines and penalties.  If any of these events were to occur, the Company could experience a disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business.\nBusiness development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult.\nWe plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities, such as acquisitions, licensing arrangements, investments and alliances.  However, these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities.  Moreover, the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity, and to integrate it into our business.  The success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities, but also on the property, resources, efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners.  Further, disputes may arise with strategic partners, due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests.\nAcquisitions are not all the same (\ne.g\n., asset acquisitions differ from acquisitions of equity interests); different acquisitions offer different risks.  Acquisitions may involve the integration of a separate company that has different systems, processes, policies and cultures.  Integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of assets or businesses we have acquired, difficulties in the diligence and integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies, or introduction of IT security vulnerabilities not adequately investigated during diligence, the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired businesses, challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses, and potential adverse effects on operating results.  The process of combining acquisitions may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses as a result of the following difficulties, among others:\n•\nloss of key customers or employees;\n•\ndifficulty in standardizing information and other systems;\n•\ndifficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;\n•\nfailure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that our Company has historically provided;\n•\ndiversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of our Company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties; and\n•\nthe added costs of dealing with such disruptions.\nIf we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected.  Even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other assets or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration, either in monetary terms or in a timely manner.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, public health emergencies and pandemics, geopolitical matters, hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities.\nWe operate facilities across the United States, and consumers frequently visit our facilities in person.  The ability of our employees and consumers to access our facilities may be adversely impacted by the effects of extreme weather events and\n37\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tropical storms, floods, fires, or other extreme weather conditions, including major winter storms, droughts and heat waves; public health emergencies and pandemics; geopolitical matters, hostilities or acts of terrorism or other activities.  Although we maintain a business continuity program to prepare for and respond to such events, because of their unpredictable nature, these events may limit or interrupt our ability to conduct operations.  Additionally, such events may interrupt our ability to transport specimens, to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services.  These events also may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees' ability to perform their job duties.\nAny future public health emergencies or pandemics may negatively affect us, including through its impact on the labor force and supply chain.\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future public health emergency or pandemic could expose us to the risks we experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and result in, among other things, a reduction in physician office visits and diagnostic testing volume, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, or customers closing or curtailing their operations, as well as increased unemployment and loss of health insurance.  We may also experience labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, including shortages, delays and price increases in testing equipment and supplies, as a result of a public health emergency or pandemic.  Suppliers and manufacturers we rely upon may experience disruptions and delays stemming from raw material and labor shortages, supply challenges and significant disruptions in transport and logistics services due to facility closures, labor constraints and other challenges.  These challenges may affect our ability to transport specimens, receive equipment, supplies or materials, or otherwise provide our services in a timely manner or at a reasonable price.  In addition, labor shortages may affect our ability to achieve our staffing or productivity goals.\nThe extent to which we may be impacted by future public health emergencies and pandemics will depend on many factors beyond our knowledge or control.  These factors include: the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of any public health emergency or pandemic; increases in infection rates and the geographic location of such increases; the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of any public health emergency or pandemic on supply chain and the global economy.  To the extent any future public health emergency or pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this Report.\nInflationary pressures could adversely impact us because of increases in the costs of materials, supplies and services, and increased labor and people-related expenses.\nInflationary pressures have resulted in increases in the costs of the testing equipment, supplies and other goods and services that we purchase from manufacturers, suppliers and others.  Inflationary pressures, along with the competition for labor, have also resulted in a rise of our labor costs, which include the costs of compensation, benefits, and recruiting and training new hires.  Our ability to raise the prices and fees we charge for the services we provide is limited.  Continuation of the current inflationary environment may adversely impact us.\nCAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\nSome statements and disclosures in this document are forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “believe,” “will,” “expect,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “aim,” “endeavor” or “continue.”\nThese forward-looking statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our plans and expectations, including actual results, to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.\nInvestors are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this document.\nThe following important factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from those projected, forecasted or estimated by us in forward-looking statements:\n(a)\nHeightened competition from commercial clinical testing companies, hospitals, physicians and others.\n(b)\nIncreased pricing pressure from customers, including payers and patients, and changing relationships with customers, payers, suppliers or strategic partners.\n(c)\nA decline in economic conditions, including the impact of an inflationary environment.\n38\n(d)\nImpact of changes in payment mix, including increased patient financial responsibility and any shift from fee-for-service to discounted, capitated or bundled fee arrangements.\n(e)\nAdverse actions by government or other third-party payers, including healthcare reform that focuses on reducing healthcare costs but does not recognize the value and importance to healthcare of clinical testing or innovative solutions, unilateral reduction of fee schedules payable to us, unilateral recoupment of amounts allegedly owed and competitive bidding.\n(f)\nThe impact upon our testing volume and collected revenue or general or administrative expenses resulting from compliance with policies and requirements imposed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers.\nThese include:\n(1)\nthe requirements of government and other payers to provide diagnosis codes and other information for many tests;\n(2)\ninability to obtain from patients a valid advance consent form for tests that cannot be billed without prior receipt of the form;\n(3)\nthe impact of additional or expanded limited coverage policies and limits on the allowable number of test units or ordering frequency of same;

    "text": "Risk Management and Strategy\nThe strength and resilience of our cybersecurity and data privacy programs are critical in maintaining the trust of our patients, customers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders.  Securing our business information, customer, patient and employee data and IT systems is an important part of our overall risk management framework.  We rely on IT systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide data and other services, including diagnostic information services for patients, clinicians and healthcare organizations, clinical testing, test ordering and reporting, billing, customer service, logistics, commercial and operational data, human resources management, legal, finance and tax compliance, and other information and processes necessary to operate and manage our business.\nWe maintain comprehensive cybersecurity and data privacy programs that are designed to be aligned to best practice frameworks and applicable laws and regulations, as well as our contractual obligations.  These enterprise-wide programs are designed to secure our facilities, information systems and safeguard data throughout its lifecycle, including data provided to third parties performing services on our behalf.  Our cybersecurity program incorporates standards, processes, and activities over a number of domains, including governance, access controls, facility and data protection, IT systems and data transmission security, threat intelligence and incident response, third-party risk management, disaster recovery and vulnerability management.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program monitors our systems and networks for threats, breaches, intrusions and other vulnerabilities; assesses the security of our company-wide software, applications and systems; conducts security audits and threat assessments; responds to cybersecurity incidents; and facilitates training for our employees.  Our program includes procedures to identify cybersecurity risks and threats of our suppliers and third-party outsourcing providers with whom we interface, or who store, process, host or transmit confidential patient and employee data or other confidential information.  Our Strategic Threat and Intelligence Center manages our threat landscape and uses a variety of security technology and threat intelligence tools designed to detect, prevent, block, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity threats.  We collaborate with government agencies regarding potential cybersecurity threats and work with consultants and other third-party advisors to conduct security assessments and independent audits of the security and resilience of our systems and networks.  At least annually, we review and test our program to simulate emergent threats and scenarios that could arise from potential cybersecurity attacks and data breaches.  Our cybersecurity program is based on multiple security frameworks, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s NIST 800 Special Publication Information Security standard, MITRE\n40\nATT&CK Framework, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, the System and Organization Controls for Service Organizations 2 (SOC 2), and ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 15189.\nWe have integrated cybersecurity risk management into our overall risk management infrastructure through our enterprise risk management program.  The enterprise risk management program, which is driven by our executive leadership, entails a formal process that identifies, assesses, mitigates and manages the risks from both internal and external conditions that could significantly impact the Company and influence our business strategy and performance.\nAlthough no cybersecurity incident during the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted in an interruption of our operations, known losses of critical data or otherwise had a material impact on our strategy, financial condition or results of operations, the scope of any future incident cannot be predicted. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information.\nGovernance\nThe Company’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), in coordination with the Company’s Chief Litigation Officer, Executive Director, Privacy Officer, Corporate Controller/Chief Accounting Officer and other internal stakeholders, is responsible for leading the team responsible for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity and data privacy risks, including implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.\nThe CISO has extensive experience working in the IT and services industry and is a subject matter expert in varied topics including cybersecurity, data integrity, IT risk, enterprise architecture, third-party risk, threat intelligence, incident response, and regulatory compliance. Management committees consisting of senior officers of the Company regularly receive briefings on cybersecurity matters, who in turn regularly report to the Board of Directors and its committees on such matters.\nThe Board of Directors and its committees play an active role in overseeing our key enterprise level risks.  Our Board, which annually reviews our enterprise risk management program, has delegated primary responsibility for overseeing the enterprise risk management program to the Audit and Finance Committee.  The Board has delegated primary oversight of cybersecurity, a key enterprise risk, to the Cybersecurity Committee.  The Board’s Quality and Compliance Committee oversees and receives regular updates on data privacy, another key enterprise risk.\nThe Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for reviewing our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, as well as our insurance programs, including regarding cybersecurity.  Our internal audit team reports to the Audit and Finance Committee on summaries of findings from completed internal audits of, among other matters, our IT security systems and processes, including network security and data protection.  The Audit and Finance Committee regularly reports to the Board on its activities.\nThe Cybersecurity Committee is responsible for the general oversight of our cybersecurity policies, plans, program and practices and risks related to cybersecurity and data security.  The Cybersecurity Committee reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of our cybersecurity program and regularly receives reports from management on cybersecurity matters.  It also reviews our management of risks and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and industry standards related to our IT security systems and processes, including network security and data protection.  The Cybersecurity Committee regularly reports on its activities to the Board to promote effective coordination and to ensure the entire Board remains apprised of the effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management and our cybersecurity risk landscape, and also assesses how management is managing these risks.\n41"

Our diagnostic information services (\"DIS\") business provides diagnostic insights from the results of our laboratory testing to empower people, physicians, and organizations to take action to improve health outcomes.  Derived from one of the world's largest databases of de-identifiable clinical lab results, our diagnostic insights reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management.  In the right hands and with the right context, our diagnostic insights can inspire actions that transform lives and create a healthier world.  We provide services to a broad range of customers within our primary customer channels - physicians (including those associated with accountable care organizations (\"ACOs\") and Federally Qualified Health Centers (\"FQHCs\")), hospitals, and patients and consumers. Our other customers include health plans, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories.  We offer broad access to clinical testing through a nationwide network of laboratories, patient service centers, phlebotomists in physician offices, and our connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile phlebotomists, nurses and other health and wellness professionals.  Our large in-house staff of medical and scientific experts, including medical directors, scientific directors, genetic counselors and board-certified geneticists, provide medical and scientific consultation to healthcare providers and patients regarding our tests and test results, and help them best utilize our services to improve outcomes and enhance satisfaction.  During 2023, we processed approximately 206 million test requisitions through our extensive laboratory network.\nClinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services.  Clinical testing is used for predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices of diseases and other medical conditions.We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: commercial clinical laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories.  In addition, we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories, specialized advanced laboratories and providers of consumer-initiated testing.\nThe clinical testing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating results and cash flows.  Typically, testing volume declines during vacation and major holiday periods, reducing net revenues and operating cash flows below annual averages.  Testing volume is also subject to declines due to severe weather or other events (such as public health emergencies and health pandemics), which can deter patients from having testing performed and which can vary in duration and severity from year to year.  Additionally, orders for clinical testing generated from customers, including physicians, hospitals, and consumers, can be affected by factors such as changes in the United States economy and regulatory environment, which affect the number of unemployed and uninsured, and design changes in healthcare plans, which affect utilization as well as patient responsibility for healthcare costs.\nWe assess our revenue performance for our DIS business based upon, among other factors, volume (measured by test requisitions) and revenue per requisition.  Each test requisition accompanies patient specimens, indicating the test(s) to be performed and the party to be billed for the test(s).  Revenue per requisition is impacted by various factors, including, among other items, the impact of fee schedule changes (i.e., unit price), test mix, payer mix, business mix, and the number of tests per requisition.  Management uses number of requisitions and revenue per requisition data to assist with assessing the growth and performance of the business, including understanding trends affecting number of requisitions, pricing and test mix. Therefore, we believe that information related to changes in these metrics from period to period are useful information for investors as it allows them to assess the performance of the business.\nDiagnostic Solutions\nOur Diagnostic Solutions (\"DS\") group, which represents the balance of our consolidated net revenues, includes our risk assessment services business, which offers solutions for insurers, and our healthcare information technology businesses, which offer solutions for healthcare providers and payers.\n2023 Highlights\n57\n(a) Excludes COVID-19 testing.\nThe impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our DIS revenues, including requisition volume and revenue per requisition, are discussed further below under \"Results of Operations\".\nFor further discussion of the year-over-year changes for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, see \"Results of Operations\" below.\nAcquisitions\nAcquisition of select assets of the laboratory services business of New York-Presbyterian\nOn April 17, 2023, we completed the acquisition of select assets of the laboratory services business of New York-Presbyterian, which serves providers and patients in New York, as well as the tri-state area and beyond, in an all cash transaction for $275 million.  The acquired business is included in our DIS business.\nFor further details, see Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAcquisition of Haystack Oncology, Inc.\nOn June 20, 2023, we acquired Haystack Oncology, Inc., an early-stage oncology company focused on minimal residual disease testing to aid in the detection of residual or recurring cancer and better inform therapy decisions. The acquisition was an all-cash transaction for $392 million, net of $1 million of cash acquired, which consisted of cash consideration of $304 million and contingent consideration initially estimated at $88 million. Under the contingent consideration obligation, the seller can receive up to $100 million of additional consideration dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks through 2028 and up to an additional $50 million of consideration dependent upon us receiving reimbursement coverage from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The acquired business is included in our DIS business.\n58\nFor further details, see Notes 6 and 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nSenior Notes Offering\nDuring November 2023, we completed a senior notes offering, consisting of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.40% senior notes due November 2033 (the \"2033 Senior Notes\").  We expect to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption or repayment of indebtedness, including our $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due April 2024.\nFor further details regarding our debt, see Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nInvigorate Program\nWe are engaged in a multi-year program called Invigorate, which includes structured plans to drive savings and improve productivity across the value chain, including in such areas as patient services, logistics and laboratory operations, revenue services, information technology and procurement.  The Invigorate program aims to deliver 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements to partially offset pressures from the current inflationary environment, including labor and benefit cost increases and reimbursement pressures.  We are leveraging automation and artificial intelligence to improve productivity and also improve quality across our entire value chain, not just in the laboratory.  Other areas of focus include reducing denials and patient concessions, enhancing the digital experience, and selecting and retaining talent.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $43 million of pre-tax charges in connection with our Invigorate program and other restructuring activities, including $25 million of employee separation costs, with the remainder primarily consisting of integration costs.  Most of the charges will result in cash expenditures.  Additional restructuring charges may be incurred in future periods, including as we identify additional opportunities to achieve further savings and productivity improvements.\nFor further details of the Invigorate program and associated costs, see Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nOutlook and Trends\nThe healthcare system in the United States continues to evolve and industry change is likely to be extensive.  Because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term. There are a number of key trends that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the growth and the nature of the diagnostic information services business in the United States and on our business.  These trends present both opportunities and risks.\nHealthcare market participants, including health plans and governments, are focusing on controlling costs, including potentially by reducing reimbursement for healthcare services, changing reimbursement for healthcare services (including but not limited to a shift from fee-for-service to capitation), changing medical coverage policies (\ne.g\n., healthcare benefits design), denying coverage for services, requiring preauthorization of laboratory testing, requiring co-pays, introducing laboratory spend management utilities and payment and patient care innovations such as ACOs and patient-centered medical homes.  In recent years, there has been an ongoing trend of rising patient responsibility which has resulted in an increase in our reserves for patient price concessions.  As health plans and government programs require greater levels of patient cost-sharing, our patient price concessions may continue to be negatively impacted and adversely impact our results of operations.  There could be a shift to capitation arrangements where we agree to a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member enrolled in a restricted plan, generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us.  In both 2023 and 2022, we derived approximately 3% of our consolidated net revenues from capitated payment arrangements.  In 2023 and 2022, we derived approximately 9% and 8%, respectively, of our testing volume from capitated payment arrangements.\nHistorically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (\"CLFS\") and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule established under Part B of the Medicare program have been subject to change, including each year.  Pursuant to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (\"PAMA\"), reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory testing were reduced from 2018 - 2020.   PAMA calls for further revision of the CLFS for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; reimbursement reduction from 2025 - 2027 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually.  PAMA's next data collection and reporting period have been delayed, most recently by federal legislation adopted in 2023, which further delayed the reimbursement rate reductions and reporting requirements until January 1, 2025.\n59\nThe diagnostic information services industry remains fragmented, is highly competitive and is subject to new competition.  Consolidation in the healthcare industry has continued at a rapid pace, including among our customer base.  Certain of our customers are seeking to diversify their service offerings and to partner with other providers to offer value-based care alternatives.  Consolidation is increasing pricing transparency, and may encourage internalization of clinical testing.\nRecent and potentially on-going inflationary pressures have resulted in increases in the cost of our operations, including the costs of testing equipment, supplies and other goods and services we purchase from manufacturers, suppliers and others.  Inflationary pressures, along with the competition for labor, have also resulted in a rise of our labor costs, which include the costs of compensation, benefits and recruiting and training new hires.  Our Invigorate program is designed to, among other things, partially offset these impacts.\nFor additional information on our key trends, which present both opportunities and risks, see \"\nItem 1. Business: The Clinical Testing Industry\n.\"\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect our reported financial results and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOur revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions, and about one-half of our total costs and expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits.  Due to the nature of our business, several of our accounting policies involve significant estimates and judgments:\n•\nrevenues and accounts receivable associated with DIS;\n•\nreserves for general and professional liability claims;\n•\nreserves for other legal proceedings; and\n•\naccounting for and recoverability of goodwill.\nRevenues and accounts receivable associated with DIS\nThe process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of receivables associated with our DIS business involves significant assumptions and judgments.  We recognize revenues primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered.  We estimate the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to receive from payer customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach.  These estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions, as discussed below.  The portfolios determined using the portfolio approach consist of the following payer customers:\n•\nHealthcare Insurers/Health Plans\n•\nGovernment Payers\n•\nClient Payers\n•\nPatients\nWe have a standardized approach to estimate the amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to, including the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions.  Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience (along with the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding) is an integral part of the estimation process related to revenues and receivables.  Adjustments to our estimated contractual allowances and implicit patient price concessions are recorded in the current period as changes in estimates. Further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded upon settlement.\n60\nWe regularly assess the state of our billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability of receivables or revenue estimates. We believe that the collectability of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing processes, most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide. As such, we strive to implement “best practices” and endeavor to increase the use of electronic ordering to reduce the number of requisitions that we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing information. We believe that our collection and revenue estimation processes, along with our close monitoring of our billing operations, help to reduce the risk associated with material adjustments to reserve estimates.  However, changes to our estimate of the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price concessions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the period that the estimates are adjusted.\nThe following table shows the approximate percentage of our total requisition volume and net revenues associated with our DIS business during 2023 applicable to each payer customer group:\n*Patients revenue includes coinsurance and deductible responsibilities; but volume associated with such revenue is reported under Healthcare insurers.\nThe following table shows net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023 applicable to each payer customer group:\nHealthcare insurers/ Health Plans\nReimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on fee-for-service schedules and on capitated payment rates.  Under fee-for-service arrangements, healthcare insurers are billed at our list price.  Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and the terms of our contractual arrangements.\nSubstantially all of the accounts receivable due from healthcare insurers represent amounts billed under fee-for-service arrangements.  Collection of our net revenues from healthcare insurers is normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the healthcare insurers within the various filing deadlines and generally occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing.  Provided we have billed healthcare insurers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, we determine if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and if so, we will reserve accordingly for the billing.\nUnder capitated arrangements with healthcare insurers, we recognize revenue based on a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member of an insurer's health plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us.  Under capitated payment arrangements, the healthcare insurers typically reimburse us in the same month services are performed, essentially giving rise to no outstanding accounts receivable at the end of a reporting period.  If any capitated\n61\npayments are not received on a timely basis, we determine the cause and make a separate determination as to whether or not the collection of the amount from the healthcare insurer is at risk and, if so, would reserve accordingly.\nGovernment payers\nReimbursements from government payers are based on fee-for-service schedules set by governmental authorities, including traditional Medicare and Medicaid.  Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience.\nCollection of our net revenues from government payers is normally a function of providing the complete and correct billing information within the various filing deadlines.  Collection generally occurs within 30 days of billing.  Provided we have billed government payers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, we determine if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and, if so, we will reserve for the billing accordingly.\nClient payers\nClient payers include physicians, hospitals, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis, and are billed based on a negotiated fee schedule.  Credit risk and ability to pay are more of a consideration for these payers than healthcare insurers and government payers.  Collection of consideration we expect to receive generally occurs within 60 to 90 days of billing.\nWe principally estimate the allowance for credit losses for client payers based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding. To the extent that any individual client payers are identified that have deteriorated in credit quality, we establish allowances based on the individual risk characteristics of such customers.\nPatients\nUninsured patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules or fees negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients.  Insured patients (includes coinsurance and deductible responsibilities) are billed based on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers.  Collection of billings from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay.  Net revenues consist of amounts billed net of discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with our policies and implicit price concessions.  Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from patients, which considers historical collection experience (along with the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding) and other factors including current market conditions.  Patient billings are generally fully reserved for when the related service reaches 210 days outstanding.  Balances are automatically written off when they are sent to collection agencies.  Allowances are further adjusted for estimated recoveries of amounts sent to collection agencies based on historical collection experience, which is regularly monitored.  Collection of consideration we expect to receive generally occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing.\nReserves for general and professional liability claims\nAs a general matter, providers of diagnostic information services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar claims.  These suits could involve claims for substantial damages.  Any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.  We maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that could result from providing, or failing to provide, clinical testing services, including inaccurate testing results, and other exposures.  Our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims; however, we are essentially self-insured for a significant portion of these claims.  While the basis for claims reserves is actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected loss experience, the process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to these types of claims involves a high degree of judgment.  Although we believe that our present reserves and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, it is possible that we may incur liabilities in excess of our recorded reserves or insurance coverage.  Changes in the facts and circumstances associated with claims could have a material impact on our results of operations (principally costs of services), cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are adjusted or paid.  See Note 19 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reserves for general and professional liability claims.\n62\nReserves for other legal proceedings\nOur businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations, including inspections and audits by governmental agencies, in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.  Although we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency would not reach a different conclusion.  Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices.  In addition, certain federal and state statutes, including the\nqui tam\nprovisions of federal and state false claims acts, allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers alleging inappropriate billing practices.  We are aware of certain pending lawsuits including class action lawsuits, and have received subpoenas related to billing practices.  See Note 19 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the various legal proceedings that we are involved in.\nThe process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to legal proceedings involves a high degree of judgment.  Management has established reserves for legal proceedings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  Changes in facts and circumstances related to such proceedings could lead to significant adjustments to reserve estimates for such matters and could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are adjusted or paid.\nAccounting for and recoverability of goodwill\nWe do not amortize goodwill, but evaluate the recoverability and measure the potential impairment of our goodwill annually, or more frequently, in the case of other events that indicate a potential impairment.  We identified the following reporting units for goodwill impairment testing in 2023:\n•\nDIS business;\n•\nRisk assessment services business, which is part of our DS businesses\nThe DIS reporting unit components have been aggregated into a single reporting unit because they have similar economic characteristics, including similarities in financial performance, nature of products or services, nature of production processes and types of customers.\nOn a quarterly basis, we perform a review of our business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our fair value and our goodwill.  If such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill and record any noted impairment loss.\nThe annual impairment test for goodwill includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value; the qualitative analysis may be performed prior to, or as an alternative to, performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we assess relevant events and circumstances, such as: (a) macroeconomic conditions; (b) industry and market considerations; (c) cost factors; (d) overall financial performance; (e) other relevant entity-specific events; (f) events affecting a reporting unit; and (g) a sustained decrease in share price.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we are required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Otherwise, no further analysis is required.  Additionally, our policy is to update the fair value calculation of our reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis.\nThe quantitative impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the carrying value is greater than our estimate of fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess.   We calculate the fair value of each reporting unit using either (i) a discounted cash flows analysis that converts future cash flow amounts into a single discounted present value amount or (ii) a market approach.  We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation.  The discounted cash flows analysis includes several unobservable inputs related to our own assumptions.  The assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flows model are based upon the best available information in the circumstances and include a forecast of expected future\n63\ncash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates that are commensurate with economic risks, assumed income tax rates and estimates of capital expenditures and working capital.  The fair values of the reporting units could be different if, for example, forecasted revenue growth rates, economic conditions, government regulations or actions by payers to control utilization of or reimbursement for healthcare services, turn out to be different than our assumptions or estimates.  Changes in the assumed discount rates due to changes in interest rates could also affect the estimated fair values of the reporting units.  We use a discount rate that considers a weighted average cost of capital plus an appropriate risk premium based upon the reporting unit being valued.  Our analysis also considers publicly available information regarding our market capitalization, as well as (i) the financial projections and future prospects of our business, including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements, and (ii) comparable sales prices, if available.  We believe our estimation methods are reasonable and reflect common valuation practices.\nWe perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with our policy to perform the quantitative test on a periodic basis, we updated the fair value calculation of our reporting units, performed the quantitative impairment test and concluded that goodwill was not impaired.  As a sensitivity, if the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units decreased by 10%, we still would have concluded that the goodwill for the reporting unit was not impaired.\nResults of Operations\nFor a comparison of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021, along with the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.  See \"Available Information.\"\nBasis of Presentation\nOur DIS business currently represents our one reportable business segment.  The DIS business for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 accounted for greater than 95% of our consolidated net revenues.  Our other operating segments consist of our DS businesses.  For further details regarding our business segment information, see Note\n20 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain results of operations data for the periods presented:\n64\nNM - Not Meaningful\nThe following table sets forth certain results of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods presented:\n65\nOperating Results\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2023 were affected by certain items that on a net basis decreased diluted earnings per share by $1.22 as follows:\n•\npre-tax amortization expense of $108 million recorded in amortization of intangible assets or $0.70 per diluted share;\n•\npre-tax charges of $44 million ($5 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $39 million in other operating expense (income), net), or $0.31 per diluted share, primarily representing a $29 million impairment charge on certain long-lived assets related to the shutdown of a business and, to a lesser extent, an $11 million loss associated with the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with previous acquisitions;\n•\npre-tax charges of $43 million ($16 million recorded in cost of services and $27 million recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses), or $0.29 per diluted share, primarily associated with workforce reductions and integration costs incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business; and\n•\npre-tax charges of $3 million in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, representing net losses associated with changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments\n; partially offset by\n•\nexcess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements of $11 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, recorded in income tax expense.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the year-over-year change in diluted weighted average common shares outstanding was principally driven by share repurchases, which positively benefited the year-over-year comparison of diluted earnings per share.\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2022 were affected by certain items that on a net basis decreased diluted earnings per share by $1.98 as follows:\n•\npre-tax amortization expense of $120 million recorded in amortization of intangible assets or $0.74 per diluted share;\n•\npre-tax charges of $93 million recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, or $0.59 per diluted share, representing costs associated with donations, contributions and other financial support through Quest for Health Equity (our initiative with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation to reduce health disparities in underserved communities);\n•\npre-tax charges of $88 million ($32 million recorded in cost of services and $56 million recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses), or $0.56 per diluted share, primarily associated with workforce reductions, systems conversions and integration incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business;\n•\npre-tax charges of $42 million ($30 million recorded in other income (expense), net, and $12 million recorded in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of tax), or $0.26 per diluted share, representing net losses associated with changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments\n; and\n•\nnet pre-tax charges of $13 million ($2 million recorded in cost of services and $11 million recorded in other operating expense (income), net), or $0.09 per diluted share, primarily representing a $14 million impairment charge on certain property, plant and equipment and a $5 million loss associated with the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with previous acquisitions, partially offset by a $10 million gain from a payroll tax credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") associated with the retention of employees; partially offset by\n•\nan income tax benefit of $18 million, recorded in income tax expense, or $0.14 per diluted share, due to a cumulative adjustment to state deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation expense; and\n•\nexcess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements of $14 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, recorded in income tax expense.\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 6.4% compared to the prior year.\n66\nDIS revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 6.6% compared to the prior year.  For the year ended December 31, 2023:\n•\nThe decrease in revenue compared to the prior year was driven by a decrease in COVID-19 testing, partially offset by growth in the base business and, to a lesser extent, the impact of recent acquisitions.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, recent acquisitions contributed approximately 0.5% to DIS revenues.\n•\nDIS volume decreased by 0.6% compared to the prior year driven by a decrease in COVID-19 testing, substantially offset by growth in the base business and the impact of recent acquisitions, which contributed approximately 0.4% to DIS volume.\n•\nRevenue per requisition decreased by 5.9% compared to the prior year driven by the decrease in COVID-19 molecular testing.\n•\nDIS revenues in the base business (including the impact of recent acquisitions) increased by 7.3% compared to the prior year.\n•\nTesting volume in the base business (including the impact of recent acquisitions) was up 6.5% compared to the prior year.\n•\nRevenue per requisition in the base business increased by 1.1% compared to the prior year principally due to an increase in the number of tests per requisition, business mix, and an increase in unit price, partially offset by growth in our Professional Laboratory Services engagements (which carry a lower revenue per requisition than the remainder of DIS).\nDS revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 0.7% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher revenues associated with our risk assessment services offered to the life insurance industry.\nCost of Services\nCost of services consists principally of costs for obtaining, transporting and testing specimens as well as facility costs used for the delivery of our services.\nCost of services decreased by $251 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.  The decrease was primarily driven by lower collection and supplies expenses associated with reduced COVID-19 testing volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by wage and benefits increases.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nSG&A consists principally of the costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts, billing operations, credit loss expense and general management and administrative support, as well as administrative facility costs.\nSG&A decreased by $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower contributions and other financial support through Quest for Health Equity, lower compensation costs (including a reduction in headcount and performance-based compensation, partially offset by wage increases) and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by $45 million of higher costs associated with changes in the value of our deferred compensation obligations.\nThe changes in the value of our deferred compensation obligations is largely offset by changes in the value of the associated investments, which are recorded in other income (expense), net. For further details regarding our deferred compensation plans, see Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, amortization expense was $12 million lower than the prior year primarily due to the prior year including an adjustment to the useful life of a customer-related intangible asset.\n67\nOther Operating Expense, Net\nOther operating expense, net includes miscellaneous income and expense items and other charges related to operating activities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, other operating expense, net principally includes a $29 million impairment charge on certain long-lived assets related to the shutdown of a business and, to a lesser extent, an $11 million loss associated with the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with previous acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, other operating expense, net includes a $14 million impairment charge on certain property, plant and equipment and a $5 million loss associated with the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with previous acquisitions, partially offset by a $10 million gain from a payroll tax credit under the CARES Act associated with the retention of employees.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net increased by $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased borrowings associated with the issuance of the 2033 Senior Notes (see \"2023 Highlights\" above) and our secured receivables credit facility.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to non-operating activities, such as gains and losses associated with investments and other non-operating assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, other income (expense), net included $20 million of gains associated with investments in our deferred compensation plans.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, other income (expense), net included $30 million of losses associated with changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments and $25 million of losses associated with investments in our deferred compensation plans.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $248 million and $264 million, respectively.  The decrease in income tax expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by a decrease in income before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees.\nThe effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 22.0% and 21.4%, respectively.  The year ended December 31, 2022 includes an $18 million income tax benefit due to a cumulative adjustment to state deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation expense, which impacted the effective income tax rate by 1.5%.  In addition, the effective income tax rates benefited from $11 million and $14 million of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEquity in Earnings of Equity Method Investees, Net of Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, there was a $18 million decrease in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes, compared to the prior year primarily due to lower demand for COVID-19 testing services at our diagnostic information services joint venture.\n68\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe address our exposure to market risks, principally the risk of changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  We seek to mitigate the variability in cash outflows that result from changes in interest rates by maintaining a balanced mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt obligations.  In order to achieve this objective, we have historically entered into interest rate swap agreements.  Interest rate swap agreements involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts.  Net settlements are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense, net.  We believe that our exposures to foreign exchange impacts and changes in commodity prices are not material to our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  For further details regarding our significant accounting policies on interest rate risk and foreign currency, see Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of our debt was estimated at approximately $4.6 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, principally using quoted prices in active markets and yields for the same or similar types of borrowings, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the debt by $127 million and $318 million, respectively.  A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates (representing 50 basis points as of December 31, 2023 and 51 basis points as of December 31, 2022) would potentially reduce the estimated fair value of our debt by approximately $139 million and $120 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nBorrowings under our secured receivables credit facility and our senior unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates.  Interest on our secured receivables credit facility is based on either commercial paper rates for highly rated issuers or the adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"Term SOFR\"), plus a spread.  Interest on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility is based on certain published rates plus an applicable margin based on changes in our public debt ratings. As such, our borrowing cost under this credit arrangement is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in our public debt ratings.  As of December 31, 2023, the borrowing rates under these debt instruments were: for our secured receivables credit facility, commercial paper rates for highly rated issuers or the adjusted Term SOFR, plus a spread of 0.80%; and for our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the adjusted Term SOFR, plus 1.00%.  As of December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under either our $525 million secured receivables credit facility or our $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with several financial institutions for a total notional amount of $500 million.  The agreements were entered into to hedge a portion of our interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates over a ten-year period related to an anticipated issuance of debt and were accounted for as cash flow hedges.  In connection with the issuance of the 2033 Senior Notes, these agreements were settled and we received $1 million.  These gains are deferred in stockholders' equity, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense, net over a ten-year period.\nA hypothetical 10% change to the variable rate component of our variable rate indebtedness would not materially change our annual interest expense.\nFor further details regarding our outstanding debt and our financial instruments and hedging activities, see Notes 14 and 16, respectively, to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nRisk Associated with Investment Portfolio\nOur investment portfolio primarily includes equity investments comprised mostly of strategic holdings in companies concentrated in the life sciences and healthcare industries.  Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings in our consolidated statement of operations.  Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values (which consist of investments in preferred and common shares of private companies) are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.\n69\nWe regularly evaluate equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values to determine if there are any indicators that the investments are impaired.  The carrying value of our equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values was $18 million as of December 31, 2023.  In conjunction with the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, we considered whether the carrying values of our investments were impaired and concluded that no such impairment existed.\nWe do not hedge our equity price risk.  The impact of an adverse movement in equity prices on our holdings in privately held companies cannot be easily quantified, as our ability to realize returns on investments depends on, among other things, the enterprises’ ability to raise additional capital or derive cash inflows from continuing operations or through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers or private sales.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly-liquid short-term investments.  Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 totaled $686 million and $315 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 5% of our $686 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the United States.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1,272 million, and decreased $446 million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of:\n•\nlower operating income in 2023 as compared to 2022; and\n•\na year-over-year change in the timing and extent of the collection of COVID-19 testing revenues.\nDays sales outstanding (\"DSO\"), a measure of billing and collection efficiency, was 50 days as of December 31, 2023 and 47 days as of December 31, 2022.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1,061 million and $543 million, respectively. The $518 million increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily a result of increased cash used for business acquisitions (see \"2023 Highlights\" for further discussion).\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $160 million, compared to $(1,732) million for the year ended December 31, 2022.  The $1,892 million change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily a result of a $1,133 million decrease in share repurchases and, to a lesser extent, 2023 including $750 million of proceeds from the issuance of the 2033 Senior Notes (see \"2023 Highlights\" for further discussion).\n70\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we borrowed $1.7 billion under our secured receivables credit facility, which was repaid prior to December 31, 2023.  Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we borrowed $125 million under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was repaid prior to December 31, 2023.  During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings or repayments under our secured receivables credit facility or our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nFor details regarding our debt and related transactions, see Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nDividend Program\nDuring each of the four quarters of 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.71 per common share.  During each of the four quarters of 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.66 per common share.  In February 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a 5.6% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.71 to $0.75 per share, or $3.00 per share annually, commencing with the dividend payable in April 2024.\nShare Repurchases\nIn February 2023, our Board of Directors increased the size of our share repurchase program by $1 billion.\nAs\nof December 31, 2023, $1.0 billion remained available under our share repurchase authorization.  The share repurchase authorization has no set expiration or termination date.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of our common stock for $276 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 10.1 million shares of our common stock for $1.4 billion.\nFor further details regarding our share repurchases, see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nA description of the terms of our indebtedness and related debt service requirements is contained in Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nA discussion of our lease obligations is contained in Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nA discussion of our noncancellable commitments to purchase products or services is contained in Note 19 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Method Investees\nOur equity method investees primarily consist of a diagnostic information services joint venture and an investment in a fund that purchases strategic holdings in private companies in the healthcare industry.  Such investees are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Our investment in equity method investees is less than 5% of our consolidated total assets.  Our proportionate share of income before income taxes associated with our equity method investees is less than 5% of our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees.  We have no material unconditional obligations or guarantees to, or in support of, our equity method investees and their operations.\nIn conjunction with the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, we considered whether the carrying values of our equity method investments were impaired and concluded that no such impairment existed.\nRequirements and Capital Resources\nWe estimate that we will invest approximately $420 million during 2024 for capital expenditures to support and grow our existing operations, principally related to investments in laboratory equipment and facilities, including laboratory automations and information technology to support our diagnostic offerings.\n71\nDuring October 2023, we amended our secured receivables credit facility.  Subsequent to the amendment, the entire $525 million facility can be used for borrowings.  Additionally, we can choose to utilize up to $150 million of such capacity to issue letters of credit (see Note 19).  Issued letters of credit reduce the available borrowing capacity under the facility.  Further, the amended facility includes an additional $75 million uncommitted accordion which, if utilized, brings the total capacity under the facility to $600 million.  The amendment extended the maturity of the entire facility to October 2025.  Subsequent to the amendment, interest on borrowings under the facility will be based on either commercial paper rates for highly-rated issuers or adjusted Term SOFR, plus a spread of 0.80%.  For further details regarding our credit facilities, see Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $1.2 billion of borrowing capacity available under our existing credit facilities, including $453 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and $750 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.  There were no borrowings under these credit facilities as of December 31, 2023. In support of our risk management program, $72 million in letters of credit under the secured receivables credit facility were outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\nOur secured receivables credit facility is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, and certain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility. Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility is also subject to certain financial covenants and limitations on indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all such applicable financial covenants.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will provide sufficient financial flexibility to fund seasonal and other working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other obligations, cash dividends on common shares, share repurchases and additional growth opportunities for the foreseeable future.  However, should it become necessary, we believe that our credit profile should provide us with access to additional financing in order to fund normal business operations, make interest payments, fund growth opportunities and satisfy upcoming debt maturities.\nImpact of New Accounting Standards\nThe adoption of new accounting standards (if any) is discussed in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nThe impacts of recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective (if any) on our audited consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n72\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in\n“Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)”\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 is effective.\nThe Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this annual report, audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 and issued their audit report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting included herein.\n73\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nF-1\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Diagnostic Information Services (DIS) Business Accounts Receivable - Contractual Allowances\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management estimates the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to receive from customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach. These estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price concessions. The portfolio approach includes the following groups of customers: healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers and patients (24%, 7%, 45% and 20% of consolidated net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023, respectively, as disclosed by management). The DIS business accounted for 96% of consolidated net accounts receivable ($1,210 million) as of December 31, 2023. Net revenues and accounts receivable recognized from healthcare insurers and government payers consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and, additionally for healthcare insurers, the terms of the Company’s contractual arrangements. As disclosed by management, the process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of receivables associated with the DIS business involves significant assumptions and judgments.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of DIS business accounts receivable - contractual allowances is a critical audit matter are the estimate of net collectible accounts receivable, specifically contractual allowances, involves significant judgment and estimation on the part of management; this in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the audit evidence related to the contractual allowances.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of DIS business accounts receivable, which included controls over management’s methodology and data used to estimate contractual allowances. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the estimate for contractual allowances, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the historical contractual allowance and collection data from the Company’s billing system, which is an input to the methodology, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions used to estimate contractual allowances by comparing actual cash collected to the prior year estimate (net accounts receivable).\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1995.\nF-2\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\nF-3\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023, 2022 AND 2021\n(in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\nF-4\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023, 2022 AND 2021\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\nF-5\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023, 2022 AND 2021\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\nF-6\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023, 2022 AND 2021\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\nF-7\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n1.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nBackground\nQuest Diagnostics Incorporated and its subsidiaries (\"Quest Diagnostics\" or the \"Company\") work across the healthcare ecosystem to create a healthier world, one life at a time.  The Company's diagnostic information services (\"DIS\") business provides diagnostic insights from the results of its laboratory testing to empower people, physicians, and organizations to take action to improve health outcomes.  Derived from one of the world's largest databases of de-identifiable clinical lab results, the diagnostic insights reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management.  In the right hands and with the right context, the diagnostic insights can inspire actions that transform lives and create a healthier world.  The Company provides services to a broad range of customers within its primary customer channels - physicians (including those associated with accountable care organizations (\"ACOs\") and Federally Qualified Health Centers (\"FQHCs\")), hospitals, and patients and consumers.  Other customers include health plans, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories.  The Company offers broad access to clinical testing through a nationwide network of laboratories, patient service centers, phlebotomists in physician offices, and connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile phlebotomists, nurses and other health and wellness professionals.  The Company's large in-house staff of medical and scientific experts, including medical directors, scientific directors, genetic counselors and board-certified geneticists, provide medical and scientific consultation to healthcare providers and patients regarding the Company's tests and test results, and help them best utilize Quest Diagnostics' services to improve outcomes and enhance satisfaction.  The Company's Diagnostic Solutions (\"DS\") group, which represents the balance of the Company's consolidated net revenues, includes the Company's risk assessment services business, which offers solutions for insurers, and the Company's healthcare information technology businesses, which offer solutions for healthcare providers and payers.\n2.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by the Company through its direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest.  Additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which the Company has a variable interest and for which the Company is the “primary beneficiary” as it has both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nIncome attributable to the minority interest in the Company's majority owned and controlled consolidated subsidiaries is recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations and the noncontrolling interest is reflected as a separate component of consolidated stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments in entities which the Company does not control, but in which it has a substantial ownership interest (generally between\n20\n% and\n49\n%) and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  These investments are classified as investments in equity method investees in the consolidated balance sheet.  The Company records its pro rata share of the earnings, adjusted for accretion of basis difference, of these investments in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Company reviews its investments in equity method investees for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nF-8\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes as revenue the amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for goods sold or services rendered primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered (see Note 3).  Net revenues from Medicare and Medicaid programs were approximately\n11\n%,\n11\n% and\n10\n% of the Company's consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nTaxes on Income\nThe provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.  Current and deferred income taxes are measured based on the tax laws that are enacted as of the balance sheet date of the relevant reporting period.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted.  Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized only if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company's unvested restricted stock units that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and, therefore, are included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share using the two-class method.  Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, adjusted for earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, adjusted for earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding after giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.  Potentially dilutive common shares include the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and performance share units granted under the Company's Amended and Restated Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan (“ELTIP”) and its Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Long-Term Incentive Plan (“DLTIP”), as well as the dilutive effect of accelerated share repurchase agreements (\"ASRs\"), if applicable.  Earnings allocable to participating securities include the portion of dividends declared as well as the portion of undistributed earnings during the period allocable to participating securities.\nF-9\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures stock-based compensation for equity awards at fair value on the date of grant and records stock-based compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards.  As such, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost\nonly for those stock-based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period, based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants.  The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change.  The terms of the Company's performance share units allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals, which are based on the financial performance of the Company and the total shareholder return of the Company relative to an index of peer companies (\"relative TSR\"), specified in the awards.  For performance share units with a goal based on the financial performance of the Company, stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on management's best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that will be earned.  The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share units expected to be earned for these awards is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change.  For performance share units with a market-based relative TSR goal, stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the award regardless of the actual number of shares earned.\nFor further details regarding stock-based compensation, see Note 18.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company determines fair value measurements used in its consolidated financial statements based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants exclusive of any transaction costs, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market.\nInputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy.  The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.\nLevel 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.  The functional currency of the Company's foreign operating subsidiaries generally is the applicable local currency.  Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates as of the end of the reporting period.  Income and expense items are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year.  Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, are included within other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses have historically not been material.  The Company may be exposed to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates primarily under certain intercompany receivables and payables.  From time to time, the Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of the eventual net cash inflows or outflows resulting from these intercompany transactions.  The Company's foreign exchange exposure is not material to the Company's consolidated financial condition.  The Company does not hedge its net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries because it views those investments as long-term in nature.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all highly-liquid investments with original maturities, at the time acquired by the Company, of three months or less.\nF-10\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments.  The Company's policy is to place its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in highly-rated financial instruments and institutions.  Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigated by the diversity of the Company's payers and their dispersion across many different geographic regions, and credit risk is concentrated among certain payers who are large buyers of the Company's services.  To reduce risk, the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of these payers and, consequently, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure, with respect to these payers, is limited.  While the Company has receivables due from federal and state governmental agencies, the Company does not believe that such receivables represent a credit risk since the related healthcare programs are funded by federal and state governments, and payment is primarily dependent on submitting appropriate documentation timely.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, receivables due from government payers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs represented approximately\n7\n% and\n6\n%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable.  The portion of the Company's accounts receivable due from patients comprises the largest portion of credit risk.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, receivables due from patients represented approximately\n20\n% and\n18\n%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable.  The Company applies assumptions and judgments including historical collection experience (including the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding) for assessing collectability and determining net revenues and accounts receivable from patients.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are reported net of allowances for credit losses.\nWhen estimating its allowance for credit losses, the Company pools its trade receivables based on the following customer types: healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers and patients, which are described in Note 3.  The Company principally estimates the allowance for credit losses by pool based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding.  To the extent that any individual payers are identified that have deteriorated in credit quality, the Company removes the customers from their respective pools and establishes allowances based on the individual risk characteristics of such customers.\nInventories\nInventories, which consist principally of finished goods testing supplies and reagents, are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or net realizable value.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application development activities and expensed as incurred for preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities.  Capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software, payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with the internal-use software project, and interest costs incurred, when material, while developing internal-use software.  Capitalization of such costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.  Costs for maintenance and training are expensed as incurred.  The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of major capital projects.  Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over the expected useful lives of the assets.  Depreciation and amortization are principally provided on the straight-line method over expected useful asset lives as of December 31, 2023 as follows:\n•\nbuildings and improvements, ranging up to thirty-one and a half years;\n•\nlaboratory equipment and furniture and fixtures, ranging from\nfive\nto\ntwelve years\n;\n•\nleasehold improvements, the lesser of the useful life of the improvement or the remaining life of the building or lease, as applicable; and\n•\ncomputer software developed or obtained for internal use, principally\nfive\nto\nten years\n.\nF-11\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the acquiree (including the fair value of non-controlling interests) over the recognized bases of the net identifiable assets acquired and includes the future economic benefits from other assets that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.  Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically reviewed for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the Company and its goodwill.  If such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred, the Company would perform an impairment test of goodwill as of the end of the quarter and record any noted impairment loss.\nThe goodwill test is performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  The annual impairment test includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value; the qualitative test may be performed prior to, or as an alternative to, performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company is required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Otherwise, no further analysis is required.  Additionally, the Company's policy is to update the fair value calculation of its reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis.\nThe quantitative impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  The Company calculates the fair value of each reporting unit using either (i) a discounted cash flows analysis that converts future cash flow amounts into a single discounted present value amount or (ii) a market approach.  The Company assesses the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time that the valuation is performed.  The Company compares the estimate of fair value for the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit.  If the carrying value is greater than the estimate of fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with its policy to perform the quantitative test on a periodic basis, the Company updated the fair value calculation of its reporting units, performed the quantitative impairment test and concluded that goodwill was\nno\nt impaired.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company performed a qualitative impairment test for its DIS reporting unit and, based on the totality of information available, the Company concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of its DIS reporting unit was greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit and, as such, no further analysis was required.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company updated the fair value calculation of its risk assessment services reporting unit, performed the quantitative impairment test and concluded that goodwill for the reporting unit was\nno\nt impaired.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are recognized at fair value, as an asset apart from goodwill if the asset (i) arises from contractual or other legal rights, or (ii) is separable.  Intangible assets, principally representing the cost of customer-related intangibles, non-competition agreements and technology acquired, are capitalized and amortized on the straight-line method over their expected useful lives, which generally range from\nfive\nto\ntwenty years\n.  Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, consisting principally of acquired tradenames, are not amortized, but instead are periodically reviewed for impairment.\nThe Company reviews indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is more than its estimated fair value.  The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test is performed at least annually, or more frequently in the case of other events that indicate a potential impairment.\nBased upon the Company’s most recent annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarter of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company concluded that indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.\nF-12\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets (including amortizable intangible assets), other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  Evaluation of possible impairment is based on the Company's ability to recover the asset from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations.  If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of the asset.  During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $\n29\nmillion impairment charge on certain long-lived assets related to the shutdown of a business.  See Note 5 for further discussion.\nInvestments\nThe Company's investments (except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) include:\n•\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values, including investments comprised mostly of strategic holdings in companies concentrated in the life sciences and healthcare industries; as well as participant-directed investments of deferred employee compensation and related Company matching contributions held in trusts pursuant to the Company's supplemental deferred compensation plans (see Note 18).  These investments are measured at fair value with both realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in current earnings within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, gains/(losses) from all equity investments with readily determinable fair values totaled $\n20\nmillion, $(\n55\n) million, and $\n56\nmillion, respectively.  See Note 8 for a discussion of the fair value of such investments.\n•\nEquity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values consist of investments in preferred and common shares of privately held companies.  These investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.  The Company regularly evaluates these equity investments to determine if there are any indicators that the investment is impaired;\nno\nimpairment charges were recognized related to these investments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.  The carrying value of these investments was $\n18\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Such amounts were included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.\n•\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities of privately-held companies.  These investments are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses presented in other comprehensive income (loss).  The carrying amount of these investments was $\n2\nmillion as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022.  See Note 8 for a discussion of the fair value of such investments.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, from time to time, to manage its exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates and foreign currencies.  This strategy includes the use of interest rate swap agreements, forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, interest rate lock agreements and foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to movements in interest and currency rates.  The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities.  These policies prohibit holding or issuing derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments that contain credit risk-related contingent features or requirements to post collateral.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents and its debt obligations.  Interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents may fluctuate as interest rates change; however, due to their relatively short maturities, the Company does not hedge these assets or their investment cash flows and the impact of interest rate risk is not material.  The Company's debt obligations consist of fixed-rate and, from time to time, variable-rate debt instruments.  The Company's primary objective is to achieve the lowest overall cost of funding while managing the variability in cash outflows within an acceptable range.  In order to achieve this objective, the Company has historically entered into interest rate swap agreements.  Interest rate swap agreements involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts.  Net settlements between the counterparties are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense, net.\nF-13\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Company accounts for these derivatives as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.  The fair value is based upon model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets including certain financial information and certain assumptions regarding past, present and future market conditions.  For a derivative instrument that has been formally designated as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument along with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  For derivatives that have been formally designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Upon maturity or early termination of an effective interest rate swap agreement designated as a cash flow hedge, unrealized gains or losses are deferred in stockholders' equity, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings, which is when the Company recognizes interest expense on the hedged cash flows.  At inception and quarterly thereafter, the Company formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.  After the initial quantitative assessment, this analysis is initially performed on a qualitative basis and, if it is determined that the hedging relationship was and continues to be highly effective, no further analysis is required.  All components of each derivative financial instrument's gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses related to a discontinued cash flow hedge shall continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur.  If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the originally specified time period, the Company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss are classified into earnings immediately.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) encompasses all changes in stockholders' equity (except those arising from transactions with stockholders) and includes:\n•\nForeign currency translation adjustments;\n•\nNet deferred gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, which represent deferred gains (losses), net of tax, on interest rate-related derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges, net of amounts reclassified to interest expense (see Notes 16 and 17); and\n•\nNet changes in available-for-sale debt securities, which represent unrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, advertising costs were $\n31\nmillion, $\n74\nmillion and $\n78\nmillion, respectively.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued a new accounting standard which provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform due to the cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate which was discontinued because of reference rate reform. The pronouncement was effective immediately and, due to an accounting update which the FASB issued in December 2022, can be applied to contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which will require companies to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\").  The pronouncement is effective for annual filings for the year ended December 31, 2024.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which will require companies to make additional income tax disclosures.  The pronouncement is effective for annual filings for the year ended December 31, 2025.  The\nF-14\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nCompany does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n3.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nDIS\nNet revenues in the Company’s DIS business accounted for greater than\n95\n% of the Company’s consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions.  The DIS business, which provides clinical testing services and other services, satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered.  The Company estimates the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to receive from payer customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach. These estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions, as discussed below. The portfolios determined using the portfolio approach consist of the following groups of payer customers: healthcare insurers, government payers (Medicare and Medicaid programs), client payers and patients.  Contracts in the DIS business do not contain significant financing components based on the typical period of time between performance of services and collection of consideration.\nThe process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant judgment and estimation.  The Company follows a standard process, which considers historical denial and collection experience and other factors (including the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding), to estimate contractual allowances and implicit price concessions, recording adjustments in the current period as changes in estimates.  Further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded upon settlement.\nThe following are descriptions of the DIS business’ portfolios:\nHealthcare Insurers/Health Plans\nReimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on negotiated fee-for-service schedules and on capitated payment rates.  Under fee-for-service arrangements, healthcare insurers are billed at the Company's list price.  Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and the terms of the Company’s contractual arrangements.\nCollection of the Company's net revenues from healthcare insurers is normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the healthcare insurers within the various filing deadlines and generally occurs within\n30\nto\n60\ndays of billing.  Provided the Company has billed healthcare insurers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, the Company determines if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and if so, it will reserve accordingly for the billing.\nUnder capitated arrangements with healthcare insurers, the Company recognizes revenue based on a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member of an insurer's health plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by the Company.  Healthcare insurers typically reimburse the Company under capitated arrangements in the same month services are performed, essentially giving rise to no outstanding accounts receivable at the end of a reporting period.  If any capitated payments are not received on a timely basis, the Company determines the cause and makes a separate determination as to whether or not the collection of the amount from the healthcare insurer is at risk and, if so, would reserve accordingly.\nGovernment Payers\nF-15\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nReimbursements from government payers are based on fee-for-service schedules set by governmental authorities, including traditional Medicare and Medicaid.  Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and other factors.\nCollection of the Company's net revenues from government payers is normally a function of providing the complete and correct billing information within the various filing deadlines and generally occurs within\n30\ndays of billing.  Provided the Company has billed government payers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, the Company determines if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and, if so, it will reserve for the billing accordingly.\nClient Payers\nClient payers include physicians, hospitals, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis, and are billed based on negotiated fee schedules.  Credit risk and ability to pay are more of a consideration for these payers than healthcare insurers and government payers.  Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive generally occurs within\n60\nto\n90\ndays of billing.\nThe Company principally estimates the allowance for credit losses for client payers based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding. To the extent that any individual client payers are identified that have deteriorated in credit quality, the Company establishes allowances based on the individual risk characteristics of such customers.\nPatients\nUninsured patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules or fees negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients.  Insured patients (includes coinsurance and deductible responsibilities) are billed based on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers.  Collection of billings from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay.  Net revenues consist of amounts billed net of discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with the Company’s policies and implicit price concessions.  Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from patients, which considers historical collection experience (including the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding) and other factors including current market conditions. Patient billings are generally fully reserved for when the related service reaches\n210\ndays outstanding.  Balances are automatically written off when they are sent to collection agencies.  Allowances are further adjusted for estimated recoveries of amounts sent to collection agencies based on historical collection experience, which is regularly monitored.  Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive generally occurs within\n30\nto\n60\ndays of billing.\nDS\nThe Company’s DS businesses primarily satisfy their performance obligations and recognize revenues when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.  Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive generally occurs within\n30\nto\n60\ndays of billing.\nF-16\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe approximate percentage of net revenues by type of payer customer was as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the Company’s services were provided within the United States, see Note 20.\nThe approximate percentage of net accounts receivable by type of payer customer as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nThe following table summarizes the activity for the Company's allowance for credit losses during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which principally relates to client payers:\nF-17\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n4.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions, except per share data):\nF-18\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n5.\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\nInvigorate Program\nThe Company is engaged in a multi-year program called Invigorate, which includes structured plans to drive savings and improve productivity across the value chain, including in such areas as patient services, logistics and laboratory operations, revenue services, information technology and procurement.  The Invigorate program aims to deliver\n3\n% annual cost savings and productivity improvements to partially offset pressures from the current inflationary environment, including labor and benefit cost increases and reimbursement pressures.  The Company is leveraging automation and artificial intelligence to improve productivity and also improve quality across the entire value chain, not just in the laboratory.  Other areas of focus include reducing denials and patient concessions, enhancing the digital experience, and selecting and retaining talent.\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges\nThe following table provides a summary of the Company's pre-tax restructuring and impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nThe restructuring charges incurred for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were partially associated with various workforce reduction initiatives as the Company continued to restructure its organization. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge on certain long-lived assets related to the shutdown of a business and, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge on certain property, plant and equipment.  Of the total restructuring and impairment charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023, $\n13\nmillion, $\n12\nmillion and $\n29\nmillion were recorded in cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating expense (income), net, respectively.  Of the total restructuring and impairment charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, $\n19\nmillion, $\n36\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion were recorded in cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating expense (income), net, respectively.  Of the total restructuring charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021, $\n8\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion were recorded in cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively.\nThe employee separation costs for all periods presented were primarily recorded in the Company's DIS business.\nThe following table summarizes the activity of the restructuring liability during 2023 and 2022, which is included in accrued expenses in Note 13:\nF-19\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n6.\nBUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\n2023 Acquisitions\nDuring 2023, the Company completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $\n699\nmillion (including contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n88\nmillion), net of cash acquired, including the acquisitions discussed below. The acquisitions preliminarily resulted in goodwill of $\n511\nmillion, of which $\n244\nmillion is deductible for tax purposes. The acquisitions also preliminarily resulted in $\n145\nmillion of technology-related intangible assets and $\n63\nmillion of customer-related intangible assets.\nAcquisition of select assets of the laboratory services business of New York-Presbyterian\nOn April 17, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of select assets of the laboratory services business of New York-Presbyterian, which serves providers and patients in New York, as well as the tri-state area and beyond, in an all-cash transaction for $\n275\nmillion. Based on the purchase price allocation, the assets acquired primarily consist of $\n222\nmillion of tax-deductible goodwill and $\n53\nmillion of customer-related intangible assets. The intangible assets are being amortized over a useful life of\n15\nyears.\nAcquisition of Haystack Oncology, Inc.\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company acquired Haystack Oncology, Inc. (\"Haystack\"), an early-stage oncology company focused on minimal residual disease testing to aid in the detection of residual or recurring cancer and better inform therapy decisions.  The acquisition was an all-cash transaction for $\n392\nmillion, net of $\n1\nmillion of cash acquired, which consisted of cash consideration of $\n304\nmillion and contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n88\nmillion.  Under the contingent consideration obligation, the seller can receive up to $\n100\nmillion of additional consideration dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks through 2028 and up to an additional $\n50\nmillion of consideration dependent upon the Company receiving reimbursement coverage from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, which may be revised as additional information becomes available during the measurement period, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed consist of $\n267\nmillion of goodwill (none of which is tax-deductible), $\n145\nmillion of technology-related intangible assets, $\n23\nmillion of deferred income tax liabilities, $\n8\nmillion of operating lease right-of-use assets and related operating lease liabilities, and $\n3\nmillion of property, plant and equipment. The intangible assets are being amortized over a useful life of\n15\nyears. For further details regarding the fair value of the Company's contingent consideration, see Note 8.\n2022 Acquisitions\nDuring 2022, the Company completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $\n162\nmillion (including contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n18\nmillion), net of cash acquired, including the acquisition discussed below.  The 2022 acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $\n121\nmillion, of which $\n103\nmillion is deductible for tax purposes.  These acquisitions also resulted in $\n45\nmillion of intangible assets, principally comprised of customer-related intangible assets.\nAcquisition of Pack Health, LLC\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company acquired Pack Health, LLC (\"Pack Health\"), a patient engagement company that helps individuals adopt healthier behaviors to improve outcomes, in an all cash transaction for $\n123\nmillion, net of $\n4\nmillion cash acquired, which consisted of cash consideration of $\n105\nmillion and contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n18\nmillion.  Based on the purchase price allocation, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed consist of $\n96\nmillion of goodwill (of which $\n78\nmillion was tax-deductible on the acquisition date), $\n30\nmillion of intangible assets, $\n5\nmillion of operating lease right-of-use assets, $\n5\nmillion of operating lease liabilities and $(\n3\n) million of working capital. The intangible assets consist primarily of customer-related assets which are being amortized over a useful life of\n15\nyears.\n2021 Acquisitions\nF-20\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nDuring 2021, the Company completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $\n346\nmillion (including contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n15\nmillion), net of cash acquired, including the acquisitions discussed below.  The 2021 acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $\n236\nmillion, of which $\n221\nmillion is deductible for tax purposes. These acquisitions also resulted in $\n107\nmillion of intangible assets, principally comprised of customer-related intangible assets.\nAcquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Mercy Health\nOn June 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Mercy Health, which serves providers and patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, in an all-cash transaction for $\n225\nmillion.  Based on the purchase price allocation, the assets acquired primarily consist of $\n171\nmillion of tax-deductible goodwill and $\n54\nmillion of customer-related intangible assets.  The intangible assets are being amortized over a useful life of\n15\nyears.\nAcquisition of assets of Labtech Diagnostics, LLC\nOn December 13, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of assets of Labtech Diagnostics, LLC (\"Labtech\"), an independent clinical diagnostic laboratory provider serving physicians and patients primarily in South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida and Georgia, in an all cash transaction for $\n95\nmillion, which consisted of cash consideration of $\n80\nmillion and contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n15\nmillion.  Based on the purchase price allocation, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed consist of $\n48\nmillion of goodwill (of which $\n33\nmillion was tax deductible on the acquisition date), $\n44\nmillion of intangible assets, $\n11\nmillion of property, plant and equipment, $\n9\nmillion of finance lease liabilities, $\n6\nmillion of operating lease right-of-use assets, $\n6\nmillion of operating lease liabilities, and $\n1\nmillion of inventories. The intangible assets consist primarily of customer-related assets which are being amortized over a useful life of\n15\nyears.\nGeneral Information\nThe acquisitions described above were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  As such, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their estimated fair values as of the closing date.  Supplemental pro forma combined financial information has not been presented as the impact of the acquisitions is not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.  The goodwill recorded primarily includes the expected synergies resulting from combining the operations of the acquired entities with those of the Company and the value associated with an assembled workforce and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.  All of the goodwill acquired in connection with these acquisitions has been allocated to the Company's DIS business.  For further details regarding business segment information, see Note 20.\n7.\nDISPOSITION\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company sold its\n40\n% ownership interest in Q\n2\nSolutions® (\"Q\n2\nSolutions\"), its clinical trials central laboratory services joint venture, to IQVIA Holdings, Inc. (\"IQVIA\"), its joint venture partner, for $\n760\nmillion in an all-cash transaction.  Prior to the transaction, the Company accounted for its minority interest as an equity method investment.  As a result of the transaction, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a $\n314\nmillion pre-tax gain in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations based on the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying value of the investment, including $\n20\nmillion of cumulative translation losses which were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company also recorded $\n55\nmillion of income tax expense related to the gain, consisting of $\n127\nmillion of current income tax expense, partially offset by $\n72\nmillion of deferred income tax benefit.\nF-21\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n8.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table provides a summary of the recognized assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nThe Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are invested in a variety of participant-directed stock and bond mutual funds that are classified as trading securities.  The trading securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the changes in the fair value of these securities, which are recorded in other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheet, are measured using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, exclusive of any transaction costs.  A corresponding adjustment for changes in fair value of the trading securities is also reflected in the changes in fair value of the deferred compensation obligation.  The deferred compensation liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the trading securities.\nThe Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation program.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are “invested” at the direction of the employee in a hypothetical portfolio of investments which are tracked by an administrator.  The Company purchases life insurance policies, with the Company named as beneficiary of the policies, for the purpose of funding the program's liability.

Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation obligation are derived using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units.  The cash surrender value, which is recorded in other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheet, and the deferred compensation obligation are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the hypothetical investments. Deferrals under the plan currently may only be made by participants who made deferrals under the plan in 2017.\nThe Company's available-for-sale debt securities are measured at fair value using discounted cash flows.  These fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is based on significant inputs that are not observable.  Significant inputs include cash flows projections and a discount rate.  The investments are recorded in other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Haystack (see Note 6 for further discussion), there is a contingent consideration obligation under which the seller can receive up to $\n100\nmillion of additional consideration dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks through 2028 and up to an additional $\n50\nmillion of consideration dependent upon the Company receiving reimbursement coverage from the CMS.  The portion of the contingent consideration obligation which is dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks was measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo method and is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined based on significant inputs that are not observable. Significant inputs include management’s estimate of revenue and other market inputs, including comparable company revenue volatility (\n40\n%) and a discount rate (\n10.5\n%).  The portion of the contingent consideration obligation which is dependent upon the Company receiving reimbursement coverage from the CMS is also classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is principally determined based on management's estimate, which is a significant input that is not observable.  Additionally, the fair value of the entire contingent consideration obligation was also impacted by a market discount rate (\n5\n%) which adjusted the estimated payments to present value.  Such discount rate decreased the initial aggregate fair value of the contingent consideration obligation by $\n21\nmillion.\nThe fair value of the contingent consideration obligation is not overly sensitive to movements in the comparable company revenue volatility or the discount rate used for the portion of the obligation that is dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks.  For example, changing the comparable company revenue volatility from\n40\n% to\n30\n% impacts the fair value by $\n7\nmillion (assuming no other inputs are modified) and changing the discount rate from\n10.5\n% to\n7.0\n% impacts the fair value by $\n4\nmillion (assuming no other inputs are modified).\nAdditionally, in connection with previous acquisitions, the Company had contingent consideration obligations based on the achievement of certain testing volume and revenue benchmarks during 2022.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of liabilities using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\nThe $\n11\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion net losses included in earnings associated with the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligation for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are reported in other operating expense (income), net.\nF-23\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nOf the aggregate $\n104\nmillion contingent consideration obligation as of December 31, 2023, $\n99\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion were included in other liabilities and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  The entire $\n23\nmillion contingent consideration obligation as of December 31, 2022 was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\nIn connection with the sale of an\n18.9\n% noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to UMass Memorial Medical Center (\"UMass\") on July 1, 2015, the Company granted UMass the right to require the Company to purchase all of its interest in the subsidiary at fair value commencing July 1, 2020.  As of December 31, 2023, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was presented at its fair value.  The fair value measurement of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that takes into account, among other items, the joint venture's expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and a discount rate commensurate with economic risk.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $\n29\nmillion impairment charge on certain long-lived assets related to the shutdown of a business and, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $\n14\nmillion impairment charge on certain property, plant and equipment.  The fair value measurements were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as they were based on significant inputs that are not observable, including cash flow projections.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short maturities of these instruments.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated at $\n4.6\nbillion and $\n3.7\nbillion, respectively.  Principally all of the Company's debt is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value of the debt is estimated based on rates currently offered to the Company with identical terms and maturities, using quoted active market prices and yields, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.\n9.\nTAXES ON INCOME\nThe Company's pre-tax income before equity in earnings of equity method investees consisted of approximately $\n1.1\nbillion, $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n2.5\nbillion from U.S. operations and pre-tax income of $\n7\nmillion, $\n2\nmillion and $\n148\nmillion from foreign operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nF-24\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, non-current deferred tax liabilities of $\n270\nmillion and $\n295\nmillion, respectively, are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had estimated net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $\n8\nmillion and $\n664\nmillion, respectively, which expire at various dates through 2043.  Estimated net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes are $\n77\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, some of which can be carried forward indefinitely while others expire at various dates through 2033.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $\n17\nmillion.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards of $\n79\nmillion and $\n77\nmillion, respectively, have each been reduced by valuation allowances of $\n31\nmillion and $\n28\nmillion, respectively.\nIncome taxes payable, including those classified as long-term in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, were $\n83\nmillion and $\n81\nmillion, respectively.  Prepaid income taxes were $\n48\nmillion and $\n26\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet.\nF-25\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following:\nThe contingent liabilities for tax positions primarily relate to uncertainties associated with the realization of tax benefits derived from the allocation of income and expense among state jurisdictions, the characterization and timing of certain tax deductions associated with business combinations, certain tax credits and the deductibility of certain expenses and settlement payments.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023, that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is $\n71\nmillion.  Based upon the expiration of statutes of limitations, settlements and/or the conclusion of tax examinations, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $\n12\nmillion within the next twelve months.\nAccruals for interest expense on contingent tax liabilities are classified in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.  Accruals for penalties have historically been immaterial.  Interest expense (income) included in income tax expense in each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $\n5\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion and $(\n2\n) million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had approximately $\n17\nmillion and $\n16\nmillion, respectively, accrued, net of the benefit of a federal and state deduction, for the payment of interest on uncertain tax positions.\nThe recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits includes estimates and judgment by management and inherently involves subjectivity.  Changes in estimates may create volatility in the Company's effective tax rate in future periods and may be due to settlements with various tax authorities (either favorable or unfavorable), the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax positions and obtaining new information about particular tax positions that may cause management to change its estimates.\nIn the regular course of business, various federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities conduct examinations of the Company's income tax filings and the Company generally remains subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective jurisdiction.  The Internal Revenue Service has either completed its examinations of the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns or the statute of limitations has expired up through and including the 2019 tax year.  At this time, the Company does not believe that there will be any material additional payments beyond its recorded contingent liability reserves that may be required as a result of these tax audits.  As of December 31, 2023, a summary of the tax years that remain subject to examination, awaiting approval, are under appeal, or are otherwise unresolved for the Company's major jurisdictions are:\nUnited States - federal        2020 - 2022\nUnited States - various states    2007 - 2022\nF-26\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n10.\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW AND OTHER DATA\nSupplemental cash flow and other data for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, costs associated with donations, contributions, and other financial support through Quest for Health Equity, the Company's initiative with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation to reduce health disparities in underserved communities, were $\n— million\n, $\n93\nmillion and $\n16\nmillion, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, adjustments to goodwill related to foreign currency translation.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, goodwill acquired was principally associated with the acquisition of Pack Health (see Note 6). For the year ended December 31, 2022, adjustments to goodwill related to an adjustment of the purchase price allocation for Labtech, partially offset by foreign currency translation.\nIntangible assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\nF-28\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $\n29\nmillion impairment charge on certain long-lived assets related to the shutdown of a business.

Subsequent to the amendment, the entire $\n525\nmillion facility can be used for borrowings.  Additionally, the Company can choose to utilize up to $\n150\nmillion of such capacity to issue letters of credit (see Note 19).  Issued letters of credit reduce the available borrowing capacity under the facility.  Further, the amended facility includes an additional $\n75\nmillion uncommitted accordion which, if utilized, brings the total capacity under the facility to $\n600\nmillion.  The amendment extended the maturity of the entire facility to October 2025.  Subsequent to the amendment, interest on borrowings under the facility will be based on either commercial paper rates for highly-rated issuers or the adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"Term SOFR\"), plus a spread of\n0.80\n%.  Borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility are collateralized by certain domestic receivables.  The Secured Receivables Credit Facility is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility.\nSenior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Company is party to a $\n750\nmillion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility” or \"Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\") which matures in November 2026.  Under the Credit Facility, the Company can issue letters of credit totaling $\n150\nmillion (see Note 19).  Issued letters of credit reduce the available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.  Additionally, the Credit Facility includes an additional $\n500\nmillion uncommitted accordion which, if utilized, brings the total capacity under the facility to $\n1.3\nbillion.  Interest on the Credit Facility is based on certain published rates plus an applicable margin based on changes in the Company's public debt ratings. The Credit Facility was amended during March 2023. Subsequent to such amendment, at the option of the Company, it may elect to lock into Term SOFR-based interest rate contracts for periods up to six months. For interest on any U.S. Dollar-denominated outstanding amounts not covered under Term SOFR-based interest rate contracts, the Company can opt for an alternate base rate, which is calculated by reference to the prime rate, the federal funds rate or an adjusted Term SOFR rate. The Company also has the option to borrow in other currencies. As of December 31, 2023 , the Company's borrowing rate for Term SOFR-based loans under the Credit Facility was adjusted Term SOFR plus\n1.00\n%. The Credit Facility contains various covenants, including the maintenance of a financial leverage ratio, which could impact the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness.\nAs of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Fa\ncility.\nF-30\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nSenior Notes\nIn November 2023, the Company completed a senior notes offering, consisting of $\n750\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n6.40\n% senior notes due November 2033 (the \"2033 Senior Notes\").  The Company incurred $\n7\nmillion of debt issuance costs associated with the 2033 Senior Notes, which are included as a reduction of the carrying amount of long-term debt and which are being amortized over the term of the related debt.\nThe Company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption or repayment of indebtedness including the Company's Senior Notes due April 2024.\nAll of the senior notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with the Company's other senior unsecured obligations.  None of the Company's senior notes have a sinking fund requirement.\nThe Company may redeem its outstanding senior notes prior to scheduled maturity, as a whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, except for certain notes for which the Company also has an option to redeem such instruments at par value on or after dates specified in the indentures governing the notes (\"the par value redemption option\").  For notes with the par value redemption option, if such notes are redeemed prior to the specified dates, the redemption price calculations exclude any interest that would have been due after such dates.\nMaturities of Long-Term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2023, long-term debt matures as follows:\nF-31\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n15.\nLEASES\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company leases office space, patient service centers, clinical laboratories, warehouses, logistic hubs and equipment primarily through operating leases, with a limited number of finance leases. A\nright-of-use asset\n, representing the underlying asset during the lease term, and a lease\nliability\n, representing the payment obligation arising from the lease, are recognized on the balance sheet at lease commencement based on the present value of the payment obligation. For operating leases, expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, interest expense on the lease\nliability\nis recognized using the effective interest method and amortization of the right-of-use asset is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.  Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, lease expense associated with short-term leases was not material.\nThe Company primarily uses its collateralized incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments as the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate.  Such incremental borrowing rates, which take into account interest rates offered to companies that have similar credit ratings to the Company, are determined using a portfolio approach which groups the Company’s leases based on tenor.\nThe Company has lease agreements with (i) right-of-use asset payments and (ii) non-lease components (i.e., payments related to maintenance fees, utilities, etc.) which have been combined and accounted for as a single lease component.\nThe Company's leases have remaining terms of less than\n1\nyear to\n14\nyears, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to approximately\n20\nyears. The Company's lease terms may include renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised and termination options that are reasonably certain not to be exercised. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property.\nCertain of the Company's lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation or a market rate which are included in the lease liabilities.\nThe Company's assets and liabilities for its lease agreements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n(a) Finance lease assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were recorded net of accumulated amortization of $\n5\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion, respectively.\nF-32\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nComponents of lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n(a) Includes short-term leases and variable lease costs (primarily usage-based maintenance fees and utilities related to real estate leases and certain equipment-related and vehicle-related costs) of $\n161\nmillion, $\n160\nmillion and $\n140\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe maturity of the Company's lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nLease term and discount rate as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nThe Company's discount rates for its operating leases were primarily determined using the Company's incremental borrowing rate.\nSee Note 10 for cash flow information on cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities and leased assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nF-33\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n16.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nInterest Rate Derivatives – Cash Flow Hedges\nFrom time to time, the Company has entered into various interest rate lock agreements and forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge part of the Company's interest rate exposure associated with the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with several financial institutions for a total notional amount of $\n500\nmillion, which were accounted for as cash flow hedges.  The agreements were entered into in order to hedge a portion of the Company's interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates over a\nten-year\nperiod related to an anticipated issuance of debt.  In connection with the issuance of the 2033 Senior Notes (see Note 14), these agreements were settled and the Company received $\n1\nmillion.  These gains are deferred in stockholders' equity, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense, net over a\nten-year\nperiod.\nInterest Rate Derivatives – Fair Value Hedges\nHistorically, the Company has entered into various fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in order to convert a portion of the Company's long-term debt into variable interest rate debt. All such fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements have been terminated and proceeds from the terminations have been reflected as basis adjustments to the hedged debt instruments and are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense, net over the remaining terms of such debt instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges included in the carrying amount of long-term debt:\n(a) As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the entire balance is associated with remaining unamortized hedging adjustments on discontinued relationships.\n17.\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST\nStockholders' Equity\nSeries Preferred Stock\nQuest Diagnostics is authorized to issue up to\n10\nmillion shares of Series Preferred Stock, par value $\n1.00\nper share.

Foreign currency translation adjustments related to indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries are not adjusted for income taxes.\nThe changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company sold its\n40\n% ownership interest in Q\n2\nSolutions, its clinical trials central laboratory services joint venture, to IQVIA, its joint venture partner.  As a result of the transaction, during the year ended December 31, 2021, $\n20\nmillion of cumulative translation losses were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income (expense), net.  See Note 7 for further details.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the gross deferred gains (losses) on cash flow hedges were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense, net.\nDividend Program\nF-35\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nDuring each of the four quarters of 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.71\nper common share.  During each of the four quarters of 2022, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.66\nper common share.  During each of the four quarters of 2021, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.62\nper common share.  In February 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a\n5.6\n% increase in its quarterly cash dividend from $\n0.71\nto $\n0.75\nper share, or $\n3.00\nper share annually, commencing with the dividend payable in April 2024.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn February 2023, the Company's Board of Directors increased the size of its share repurchase program by $\n1\nbillion.\nAs\nof December 31, 2023, $\n1.0\nbillion remained available under the Company's share repurchase authorization.  The share repurchase authorization has no set expiration or termination date.\nShare Repurchases\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased\n2.0\nmillion shares of its common stock for $\n276\nmillion.\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company repurchased\n10.1\nmillion shares of its common stock for $\n1.4\nbillion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased\n16.0\nmillion shares of its common stock for $\n2.2\nbillion, including shares repurchased under ASRs. The repurchases during the year included an accrual of $\n23\nmillion recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet for share repurchases not settled until after December 31, 2021.\nIn April 2021, the Company entered into ASRs with several financial institutions to repurchase its common stock as part of a share repurchase program.  Each of the ASRs was structured to permit the Company to purchase shares immediately with the final purchase price of those shares determined by the volume-weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the repurchase period, less a fixed discount, and was accounted for as two transactions: (1) a treasury stock repurchase and (2) a forward contract.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid $\n1.5\nbillion to the financial institutions and received\n10.7\nmillion shares of its common stock under the ASRs.\nShares Reissued from Treasury Stock\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company reissued\n2\nmillion shares from treasury stock for shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") and stock-based compensation program.\nTreasury Stock Retirement\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company retired\n55\nmillion shares of treasury stock. In accordance with the Company's policy, the amount paid to repurchase the shares in excess of par value was allocated between retained earnings and additional paid-in capital based on a pro-rata allocation of additional paid-in capital at the time of the share retirement.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nIn connection with the sale of an\n18.9\n% noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to UMass on July 1, 2015, the Company granted UMass the right to require the Company to purchase all of its interest in the subsidiary at fair value commencing July 1, 2020.  The subsidiary performs diagnostic information services in a defined territory within the state of Massachusetts.  Since the redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of the Company's control, it has been presented outside of stockholders' equity at the greater of its carrying amount or its fair value.  The Company records changes in the fair value of the noncontrolling interest immediately as they occur.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was $\n76\nmillion and $\n77\nmillion, respectively, and was presented at its fair value.\nF-36\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n18.\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP AND COMPENSATION PLANS\nEmployee and Non-employee Directors Stock Ownership Programs\nThe ELTIP provides for three types of awards: (a) stock options, (b) stock appreciation rights and (c) stock awards.  The ELTIP provides for the grant to eligible employees of either non-qualified or incentive stock options, or both, to purchase shares of Company common stock at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Grants of stock appreciation rights allow eligible employees to receive a payment based on the appreciation of Company common stock in cash, shares of Company common stock or a combination thereof.  The stock appreciation rights are granted at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the ELTIP expire on the date designated by the Board of Directors but in no event more than\nten years\nfrom date of grant.  No stock appreciation rights have been granted under the ELTIP.  Under the ELTIP, awards are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the end of the vesting period prescribed by the Board of Directors.  For all award types, the vesting period is generally over\nthree years\nfrom the date of grant.  For performance share units, the actual amount of shares earned is based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards.  The performance goals for awards granted in 2021, 2022 and 2023 were based on the financial performance of the Company, as well as relative TSR.  The maximum number of shares of Company common stock in respect of which awards may be granted under the ELTIP is approximately\n87\nmillion shares.\nThe DLTIP provides for the grant to non-employee directors of non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Company common stock at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  The DLTIP also permits awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units to non-employee directors.  Stock options granted under the DLTIP expire on the date designated by the Board of Directors but in no event more than\nten years\nfrom date of grant.  For all award types, the vesting period is generally over\nthree years\nfrom the date of grant, regardless of whether the award recipient remains a director of the Company.  The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the DLTIP is\n2.4\nmillion shares.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, grants under the DLTIP totaled\n12\nthousand shares,\n10\nthousand shares and\n12\nthousand shares, respectively.\nThe Company's practice is to issue shares related to its ESPP and stock-based compensation program solely from common stock held in treasury.  See Note 17 for further information regarding the Company's share repurchase program.\nThe fair value of each stock option award granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-valuation model.  The expected volatility under the Black-Scholes option-valuation model was based on historical volatilities of the Company's common stock.  The dividend yield was based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant.  The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the expected holding period of the related award.  The expected holding period was estimated using the historical stock option exercise behavior of employees. The Black-Scholes option-valuation model also incorporates the average market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in valuing stock options granted in the periods presented were:\nF-37\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following summarizes the activity relative to stock option awards for 2023:\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing common stock price on the last trading day of 2023 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2023.  This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock.  Total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n42\nmillion, $\n70\nmillion and $\n83\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $\n5\nmillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to nonvested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.6\nyears.\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is the average market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant.  For performance share units with a goal based on the financial performance of the Company, the fair value is based on the average market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company's common stock during the vesting period.  For performance share units with a market-based relative TSR goal, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.  The expected volatility under the Monte Carlo valuation model is based on the historical volatility of the common stock of the Company and the common stock of the companies in the peer index.  The dividend yield is based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the performance period of the related award.\nF-38\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe weighted average assumptions used in valuing performance share units with a market-based relative TSR goal in the periods presented were:\nThe following summarizes the activity relative to stock awards, including restricted stock units and performance share units, for 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $\n37\nmillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to nonvested stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.7\nyears.  Total fair value of shares vested was $\n74\nmillion, $\n72\nmillion and $\n59\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  For performance share units with a goal based on financial performance of the Company, the amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost is subject to change based on changes, if any, to management's best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that will be earned at the end of the performance periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation expense totaled $\n77\nmillion, $\n77\nmillion and $\n79\nmillion, respectively.  Income tax benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation expense totaled $\n24\nmillion, $\n27\nmillion and $\n32\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which includes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements of $\n11\nmillion, $\n14\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Company's ESPP, substantially all employees can elect to have up to\n10\n% of their annual wages withheld to purchase Quest Diagnostics common stock.  The purchase price of the stock is\n95\n% of the market price of the Company's common stock on the last business day of each calendar month.  Under the ESPP, the maximum number of shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock which may be purchased by eligible employees is\n9\nmillion.  Approximately\n208\nthousand shares,\n216\nthousand shares and\n200\nthousand shares of common stock were purchased by eligible employees in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company maintains qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all of its employees.  The maximum Company matching contribution is\n5\n% of eligible employee compensation.  The Company's expense for contributions to its defined contribution plans aggregated $\n96\nmillion, $\n95\nmillion and $\n93\nmillion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nF-39\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nSupplemental Deferred Compensation Plans\nThe Company has a supplemental deferred compensation plan that is an unfunded, non-qualified plan that provides for certain management and highly compensated employees to defer up to\n50\n% of their salary in excess of their defined contribution plan limits and for certain eligible employees, up to\n95\n% of their variable incentive compensation.  The maximum Company matching contribution is\n5\n% of eligible employee compensation.  The compensation deferred under this plan, together with Company matching amounts, are credited with earnings or losses measured by the mirrored rate of return on investments elected by plan participants.  Each plan participant is fully vested in all deferred compensation, Company match and earnings credited to their account.  The amounts accrued under the Company's deferred compensation plans were $\n70\nmillion and $\n68\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Although the Company is currently contributing all participant deferrals and matching amounts to a trust, the funds in this trust, totaling $\n70\nmillion and $\n68\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are general assets of the Company and are subject to any claims of the Company's creditors.\nThe Company also offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation program.  The Company matches employee contributions equal to\n25\n%, up to a maximum of\nfive thousand\ndollars per plan year.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are “invested” at the direction of the employee in a hypothetical portfolio of investments which are tracked by an administrator.  Each participant is fully vested in their deferred compensation and vests in Company matching contributions over a period of\nfour years\nat\n25\n% per year.  This plan was amended effective January 1, 2018 so that future deferrals under the plan may only be made by participants who made deferrals under the plan in 2017.  The amounts accrued under this plan were $\n61\nmillion and $\n52\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The Company purchases life insurance policies, with the Company named as beneficiary of the policies, for the purpose of funding the program's liability.  The cash surrender value of such life insurance policies was $\n55\nmillion and $\n46\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company's expense for matching contributions to these plans was not material.\n19.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLetters of Credit and Contractual Obligations\nThe Company can issue letters of credit under its Secured Receivables Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (see Note 14).  In support of its risk management program, to ensure the Company’s performance or payment to third parties, $\n72\nmillion in letters of credit under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility were outstanding as of December 31, 2023.  The letters of credit primarily represent collateral for current and future automobile liability and workers’ compensation loss payments.\nThe Company has certain noncancelable commitments, primarily under take-or-pay arrangements, to purchase products or services from various suppliers, mainly for consulting and other service agreements, and standing orders to purchase reagents and other laboratory supplies.  As of December 31, 2023, the approximate total future purchase commitments are $\n793\nmillion, of which $\n214\nmillion are expected to be incurred in 2024, $\n352\nmillion are expected to be incurred in 2025 through 2026 and the balance thereafter.\nBilling and Collection Agreement\nIn September 2016, the Company entered into a\nten-year\nagreement with a third party to outsource its billing and  related operations for the majority of the Company’s revenues.  Services under the agreement commenced during the fourth quarter of 2016.  The agreement includes an annual fee, which is subject to adjustment based on certain changes in the Company's requisition volume and the achievement of various performance metrics.\nF-40\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nContingent Lease Obligations\nThe Company remains subject to contingent obligations under certain real estate leases, including real estate leases that were entered into by certain predecessor companies of a subsidiary prior to the Company's acquisition of the subsidiary.  While over the course of many years, the title to certain properties and interest in the subject leases have been transferred to third parties and the subject leases have been amended several times by such third parties, the lessors have not formally released the subsidiary predecessor companies from their original obligations under the leases and therefore remain contingently liable in the event of default.  The remaining terms of the lease obligations and the Company's corresponding indemnifications range up to\n24\nyears.  The lease payments under certain leases are subject to market value adjustments and contingent rental payments and therefore, the total contingent obligations under the leases cannot be precisely determined but are likely to total several hundred million dollars.  A claim against the Company would be made only upon the current lessee's default and, in certain cases, after a series of claims and corresponding defaults by third parties that precede the Company in the order of liability.  The Company also has certain indemnification rights from other parties to recover losses in the event of default on the lease obligations.  The Company believes that the likelihood of its performance under these contingent obligations is remote and no liability has been recorded for any potential payments under the contingent lease obligations.\nCertain Legal Matters\nThe Company may incur losses associated with these proceedings and investigations, but it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss, if any, that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, or other resolution of these proceedings and investigations based on the stage of these proceedings and investigations, the absence of specific allegations as to alleged damages, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, if applicable, and/or the lack of resolution of significant factual and legal issues.  The Company has insurance coverage rights in place (limited in amount; subject to deductible) for certain potential costs and liabilities related to these proceedings and investigations.\nIn 2020,\ntwo\nputative class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey against the Company and other defendants with respect to the Company’s 401(k) plan. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the fiduciaries of the 401(k) plan breached their duties by failing to disclose the expenses and risks of plan investment options, allowing unreasonable administration expenses to be charged to plan participants, and selecting and retaining high cost and poor performing investments.  In October 2020, the court consolidated the\ntwo\nlawsuits under the caption\nIn re: Quest Diagnostics ERISA Litigation\nand plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint.  In May 2021, the court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint.  Discovery has been completed.  Plaintiffs' motion for class certification and the Company's motion for summary judgment are pending.\nOn June 3, 2019, the Company reported that Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc./American Medical Collection Agency (“AMCA”) had informed the Company and Optum360 LLC that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA’s system between August 1, 2018 and March 30, 2019 (the “AMCA Data Security Incident”).  Optum360 provides revenue management services to the Company, and AMCA provided debt collection services to Optum360.  AMCA first informed the Company of the AMCA Data Security Incident on May 14, 2019.  AMCA’s affected system included financial information (e.g., credit card numbers and bank account information), medical information and other personal information (e.g., social security numbers). Test results were not included.  Neither Optum360’s nor the Company’s systems or databases were involved in the incident. AMCA also informed the Company that information pertaining to other laboratories’ customers was also affected.  Following announcement of the AMCA Data Security Incident, AMCA sought protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.  The bankruptcy proceeding has been dismissed.\nF-41\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nNumerous putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company related to the AMCA Data Security Incident.  The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the cases that were then still pending to, and consolidated them for pre-trial proceedings in, the U.S. District Court for New Jersey.  In November 2019, the plaintiffs in the multidistrict proceeding filed a consolidated putative class action complaint against the Company and Optum360 that named additional individuals as plaintiffs and that asserted a variety of common law and statutory claims in connection with the AMCA Data Security Incident.  In January 2020, the Company moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint; the motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part.  Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the Company also moved to dismiss. The motion was granted in part and denied in part.  Discovery is proceeding.\nIn addition, a group of state attorney general offices are investigating the Company in connection with the AMCA Data Security Incident.  The Company is cooperating with the investigation.\nReproSource Fertility Diagnostics, Inc. (“ReproSource”), a subsidiary of the Company, is subject to\ntwo\nputative class action lawsuits related to a data security incident that occurred in August 2021 in which plaintiffs allege that an unauthorized party accessed or acquired protected health information and personally identifiable information of ReproSource patients.\nBickham v. ReproSource Fertility Diagnostics, Inc.\nis pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and\nTrouville v. ReproSource Fertility Diagnostics, Inc.\nis pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. A third case filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts,\nGordon v. ReproSource Fertility Diagnostics, Inc.\n, was consolidated into the\nBickham\ncase. The\nBickham\nand\nTrouville\ncomplaints seek to represent a class of all individuals potentially impacted by the August 2021 data security incident, and generally allege that ReproSource, among other claims, failed to adequately safeguard patients’ private information.\nOn January 10, 2024, ReproSource agreed to settle the\nBickham\ncase on a class-wide basis. The settlement is pending approval by the District Court. If approved, ReproSource will receive a full release for all claims that the settlement class might possess arising out of the August 2021 data security incident. A motion to dismiss, stay, or transfer the\nTrouville\ncase to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts remains pending.\nThe Company is subject to a putative class action entitled\nCole, et al. v Quest Diagnostics Incorporated\n, which was filed in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, for allegedly conspiring with Facebook to track customers’ internet communications on Company web platforms without authorization, in violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act\n.\nThe complaint alleged that the Company’s actions were an invasion of privacy and contributed to a loss of value in plaintiffs’ personally identifiable information.  The Company moved to dismiss the case or, in the alternative, transfer venue to the U.S. District Court for New Jersey.  Subsequently, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the Company also moved to dismiss.  The Company's motion to transfer the case was granted.  The Company has refiled its motion to dismiss with the New Jersey District Court.\nAs previously disclosed, in August 2011, the Company had received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia seeking various business records, including records related to the Company's compliance program, certain marketing materials, certain product offerings, and certain test ordering and other policies. The Company cooperated with the request. In 2021, a third amended complaint in a qui tam action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia was unsealed, which is related to the matter underlying the August 2011 subpoena. Both the U.S. Department of Justice and the State of Georgia declined to intervene in the action. The Company moved to dismiss the complaint and the complaint was dismissed without prejudice in August 2022.  The relator subsequently filed a fourth amended complaint. The Company has moved to dismiss the fourth amended complaint.\nThe Company also received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.  The subpoenas seek various records relating to the Company’s relationship with the New York Giants and adherence to certain company policies and federal laws.  The Company is cooperating with the investigation.\nOther Legal Matters\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with the Company's activities as a provider of diagnostic testing, information and services.  These actions could involve claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages, and could have an adverse impact on the Company's client base and reputation.\nF-42\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings by governmental agencies regarding the Company's business which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.\nThe federal or state governments may bring claims based on the Company's current practices, which it believes are lawful.  In addition, certain federal and state statutes, including the\nqui tam\nprovisions of the federal False Claims Act, allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers.  The Company is aware of lawsuits, and from time to time has received subpoenas, related to billing or other practices based on the False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes, regulations or other laws.  The Company understands that there may be other pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other \"whistleblowers\" as to which the Company cannot determine the extent of any potential liability.\nManagement cannot predict the outcome of such matters.  Although management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, given the high degree of judgment involved in establishing loss estimates related to these types of matters, the outcome of such matters may be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid.\nThese matters are in different stages.  Some of these matters are in their early stages.  Matters may involve responding to and cooperating with various government investigations and related subpoenas.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company does not believe that material losses related to legal matters are probable.\nReserves for legal matters totaled $\n6\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nReserves for General and Professional Liability Claims\nAs a general matter, providers of clinical testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims.  These suits could involve claims for substantial damages.  Any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on the Company's client base and reputation.  The Company maintains various liability insurance coverages for, among other things, claims that could result from providing, or failing to provide, clinical testing services, including inaccurate testing results, and other exposures.  The Company's insurance coverage limits its maximum exposure on individual claims; however, the Company is essentially self-insured for a significant portion of these claims.  Reserves for such matters, including those associated with both asserted and incurred but not reported claims, are established on an undiscounted basis by considering actuarially determined losses based upon the Company's historical and projected loss experience.  Such reserves totaled $\n173\nmillion and $\n169\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.  Management believes that established reserves and present insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures.\n20.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company's DIS business is the only reportable segment based on the manner in which the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's CODM, assesses performance and allocates resources across the organization.  The DIS business provides diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers within its primary customer channels - physicians, hospitals, and patients and consumers.  The DIS business accounted for greater than\n95\n% of net revenues in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nAll other operating segments include the Company's DS businesses, which consist of its risk assessment services and healthcare information technology businesses.  The Company's DS businesses offer solutions for insurers and offer solutions for healthcare providers and payers.\nAs of December 31, 2023, substantially all of the Company’s services were provided within the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s assets were located within the United States.\nF-43\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table is a summary of segment information for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Segment asset information is not presented since it is not used by the CODM at the operating segment level.  Operating earnings (loss) of each segment represents net revenues less directly identifiable expenses to arrive at operating income (loss) for the segment.  General corporate activities included in the table below are comprised of general management and administrative corporate expenses, amortization and impairment of intangibles assets and other operating income and expenses, net of certain general corporate activity costs that are allocated to the DIS and DS businesses.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those of the Company as set forth in Note 2.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nF-44\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nCapital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nThe approximate percentage of net revenues by major service for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nThe approximate percentage of net revenues by customer channel for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nPhysician lab services includes net revenues for physicians including those associated with ACOs and FQHCs.\n21.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nDuring February 2024, the Company acquired the assets of Lenco Diagnostics Laboratories, Inc., an independent clinical diagnostic laboratory provider serving physicians in New York, in an all-cash transaction for $\n111\nmillion.  The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. The Company is in the process of completing the preliminary purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nF-45"
