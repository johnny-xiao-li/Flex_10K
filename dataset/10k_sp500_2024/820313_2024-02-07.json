Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us with the opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to particular end markets.  Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base is an important asset of the Company.\n​\nFor many years, customers have generally been consolidating their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining geographic flexibility and competitive prices.  The Company has positioned its global resources to compete effectively in this environment.  As an industry leader, the Company has established close working relationships with many of its customers on a global basis. These relationships allow the Company to better anticipate and respond to these customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions.  By working with customers to develop new products and technologies, the Company is able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our portfolio of products.  In addition, the Company has concentrated its efforts on service, procurement and manufacturing improvements designed to increase product quality and performance and lower product lead-time and cost.  For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s sales, refer to the subsection titled “Risks Related to our End Markets” included in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nherein.\n​\nThe Company’s products are sold to thousands of original equipment manufacturers (or OEMs) in numerous countries throughout the world. The Company’s products are also sold to electronic manufacturing services (EMS) companies, to original design manufacturers (or ODMs) and to service providers, including telecommunications network service providers and web service providers.  No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n​\nThe Company sells its products through its own global sales force, independent representatives and a global network of electronics distributors.  The Company’s sales to distributors represented approximately 17% and 18% of the Company’s net sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively.  In addition to product design teams and collaborative initiatives with customers, the Company uses key account managers to manage certain customer relationships on a global basis so that it can bring to bear its total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers.\n​\nManufacturing\n​\nThe Company is a global manufacturer employing advanced manufacturing processes including molding, stamping, plating, turning, computer numerical control (CNC) machining, 3D printing, extruding, die casting, certain other manufacturing, automation and assembly operations and proprietary process technology for connectors, specialty and coaxial cable production, antenna and sensor fabrication.  Outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes is used when cost-effective. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing facilities operate under certification to management system standards of globally recognized, industry certification organizations.  Many of our facilities are certified to quality management systems, primarily ISO9001, but also may include ISO13485, AS9100, and IATF16949.  In addition, approximately half of our facilities are also certified to environmental or occupational health and safety management systems, including ISO14001 and ISO45001.\n​\n7\nThe Company’s manufacturing facilities are generally vertically integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and manufacturing.  The Company designs, manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in approximately 40 countries around the world.  Our global coverage positions us near many of our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production and logistics costs.  In addition, the Company generally relies on local management in every region, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and operational agility, as well as a deeper understanding of local markets. We believe our broad and balanced geographic distribution lowers our exposure to particular geographies.  This was evident in recent years, as we were generally able to support our customers even if pandemic-related restrictions and other challenges were present in a particular geography.  The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage, as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers, while at the same time offering a level of resiliency and diversification against local risks and challenges that may emerge in any single geography.\n​\nThe Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to provide proximity and reliable service to customers, while also lowering production and logistics costs.  Our strategy is to maintain strong cost and quality controls in our manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company evaluates and adjusts its expense levels and workforce to reflect current business conditions and attempts to maximize operating profitability as well as the return on capital investments.  This strategy has been, and continues to be, critical to the Company’s ability to mitigate supply chain constraints, such as those experienced in recent years, and the higher inflationary environment, which began in 2022 and persisted into 2023.  The Company sources its products on a worldwide basis.  To better serve certain high-volume customers, the Company has established certain facilities near these major customers.  The Company seeks to position its manufacturing and assembly facilities in order to serve local markets while coordinating, as appropriate, product design and manufacturing responsibility with the Company’s other operations around the world.  For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s global operations, refer to the subsection titled “Risks Related to our Global Operations” included in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nherein.\n​\nResearch and Development\n​\nThe Company’s product development strategy is to rely on product design teams at each of our operating units around the world working collaboratively with customers, which often results in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers’ new products and programs.  The Company generally focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period.  The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue.  At the end of 2023, our research, development and engineering efforts, which relate to the creation of new and improved products and processes, were supported by approximately 4,000 of our employees and were performed primarily by individual operating units focused on specific markets and product technologies.\n​\nIntellectual Property\n​\nWe own a significant portfolio of patents that principally relate to mechanical, electrical, radio frequency, optical and electronic features of connector, antenna and sensor products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks.  Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon the laws of various jurisdictions and the use of the trademarks.\n​\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.\n​\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in disputes with third parties regarding the Company’s or such third party’s intellectual property assets, particularly patents.  While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by the loss of any single patent or group of related patents, or by a third party’s successful enforcement of its\n8\npatents against us or any of our products.  For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s intellectual property, refer to the risk factor titled “\nWe may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others\n” in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nherein.\n​\nRaw Materials\n​\nThe Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including (i) precious metals such as gold, silver and palladium, (ii) aluminum, steel, copper, titanium and metal alloy products and (iii) plastic materials.  The Company also purchases a wide variety of mechanical and electronic components for the manufacturing of its products.  Such raw materials and components are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or components or, if one source is used, the Company generally attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements.  From time to time, the Company may encounter difficulties in obtaining certain raw materials or components necessary for production due to supply chain constraints and logistical challenges, which may include regulatory restrictions.  These difficulties may also negatively impact the pricing of materials and components sourced or used by the Company.  While the Company does not currently anticipate significant, broad-based difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production, inflationary pressures and logistical challenges may impact the cost and availability of certain raw materials and components used by the Company and result in supply shortages for discrete raw materials or components, which could be further exacerbated by increased commodity prices and additional inflation.  For a discussion of certain risks related to the availability of and dependence on raw materials and components, refer to the risk factor titled “\nThe Company and certain of its suppliers and customers have experienced difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of certain of the Company’s raw materials and components is increasing\n” in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nherein.  Information regarding our obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services is disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nCompetition\n​\nThe Company encounters competition in all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time.  Primary competitors include Aptiv, Belden, Commscope, Eaton, Foxconn, Glenair, HARTING, Hirose, HUBER+SUHNER, ICT Luxshare, JAE, Jonhon, JST, Molex, Phoenix Contact, Radiall, Rosenberger, Sensata, TE Connectivity, Yazaki and 3M, among others.  In addition, the Company competes with a large number of smaller companies who compete in specific geographies, markets or products.  For a discussion of certain risks related to competition, refer to the risk factor titled “\nThe Company encounters competition in all areas of our business\n” in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nherein.\n​\nBacklog\nand Seasonality\n​\nThe Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled firm orders as of December 31, 2023 was approximately $4.0 billion compared with backlog of approximately $4.1 billion as of December\n31, 2022.  Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions.  Unfilled orders may generally be cancelled prior to shipment of goods.  It is expected that nearly all of the Company’s backlog will be filled within the next 12 months.  A significant portion of the Company’s business, such as sales to the communications-related markets (including wireless communications, information technology and data communications and broadband communications) and sales to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.  Generally, the Company does not experience significant seasonality in its business, although historically, the strongest quarters have typically been the last two quarters of our fiscal year\n.\n​\nEnvironmental Matt\ners\n​\nCertain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.  The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  For more information on certain environmental matters, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  For a discussion of certain risks related to environmental matters, refer to\n9\nthe risk factor titled “\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business\n” in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nherein.\n​\nGovernment Regulation\n​\nAs a global company, we are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the U.S. and other governments, including laws and regulations governing reporting obligations, interactions with government officials, performance of government contracts, the use and treatment of government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products.  In addition, the Company and its products are subject to import and export regulations present in each of the various jurisdictions in which we operate around the world.  Certain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. export control laws and regulations, and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception.  The issuances of such licenses, in particular within the defense market, are subject to complex laws and regulations that could change frequently and with limited notice, depending on the jurisdiction, geopolitical events or other factors.  The Company has systems in place to apply for licenses and to maintain compliance with any such regulations.  Separately, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and non-U.S. economic sanctions and trade embargoes, as well as the terms of any preferential duty and/or tariff programs in which we participate.\n​\nFor a discussion of certain risks related to government regulation, including export and import controls and sanctions, refer to the risk factors titled “\nThe Company is exposed to political, economic, military and other risks related to operating in countries outside the United States, and changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company’s control may adversely impact its business and operating results\n,” “\nThe Company must comply with complex U.S. governmental export and import controls as well as economic sanctions and trade embargoes\n,” “\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks\n,” and “\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners\n,” in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nherein.\n​\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\n​\nWe have a shared commitment to create innovative products and enable technologies that improve the lives of people around the world, to support the well-being of our employees and communities and to sustain the health of our planet.  We believe that long-term value for our Company is created through making sustainable business choices, building strong relationships with our stakeholders and engaging in good corporate governance.  Whether through reducing our and our partners’ environmental footprint, following humane labor practices, supporting the development and diversity of our global team, ensuring the strength and integrity of our supply chain or giving back to our communities, we have always believed that it is not just good stewardship, but good business to focus on the long-term sustainability of Amphenol\n.\n​\nSustainability Report\n​\nThe Company publishes an annual sustainability report (“Sustainability Report”) to highlight our goals and areas of progress and success in sustainability matters, including climate-related topics.  The Sustainability Report discusses our approach and progress on the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues most significant to our business, including ESG-related strategies, programs, goals and metrics that demonstrate our commitment to our stakeholders.  The Sustainability Report is designed to inform and engage the Company’s broad range of stakeholders, such as employees, suppliers, customers, community members and investors, among others.  Our 2022 Sustainability Report was prepared with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards framework and topics identified under the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) standards and outlines board and executive-level oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities identified in the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations.  The SASB standards and GRI and TCFD frameworks encourage companies to disclose climate-related topics that are important to certain interested stakeholders, even if not material for purposes of the U.S. securities laws.  Furthermore, the materiality standards under these frameworks are different from the materiality standard under the U.S. securities laws.  Our 2022 Sustainability Report\nis available on our website at https://amphenol.com/sustainability\n.  The items discussed in our 2022 Sustainability Report have not required material capital expenditures or operating expenses, nor caused material operational challenges or risks to the Company’s business or results of operations beyond those items disclosed in Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nwithin the risk factors titled “\nThe\n10\nCompany may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused or intensified by climate change and global warming\n,” “\nThe Company is subject to, and may continue to be subject to, incremental costs, risks and regulations associated with efforts to combat the negative effects of climate change\n,” and “\nIncreasing scrutiny and expectations regarding ESG matters could result in additional costs or risks or otherwise adversely impact our business\n”.\nInformation included in our 2022 Sustainability Report and our website is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report.  Our 2023 Sustainability Report is expected to be released during the second quarter of 2024.\n​\nHuman Capital Management and Our Culture\n​\nThe Company’s success is closely tied to the capability, adaptability and accountability of our diverse, global organization.  One of the key components of our business strategy is the fostering of a collaborative and entrepreneurial management culture. Each of our general managers operates in a flat organizational structure and is enabled and incented to grow and develop their business, with the support of the resources of the larger organization.  We believe this structure, with approximately 130 general managers running unique, independent businesses, creates an environment and culture where each of our general managers has a more direct link to the success of their individual businesses and a more personal connection to the employees they oversee and the communities in which they operate.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 95,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 11,000 were located in the United States.  Less than 10% of Amphenol’s U.S. workforce is represented by an independent trade union or covered by collective bargaining.  The Company believes that it has a good relationship with both its unionized and non-unionized employees.\n​\nGovernance and Culture\n– Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is actively involved in overseeing the Company’s employee-related strategies and practices as well as the Company’s culture and ESG initiatives. This oversight is conducted both directly and through certain of the Board’s committees.  At each of its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings, the Board reviews changes in key personnel and, at least once a year, meets with management to discuss various human resources related topics, including talent development, succession planning, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, compensation and culture. We believe the Company’s culture has been a critical component of the Company’s success and reinforcing that culture is a key responsibility of our executive management.\n​\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n– Amphenol is committed to workplace diversity and fostering a culture of equity, inclusion and belonging across our organization.  Our business spans the globe, and the employees in our facilities reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate.  At Amphenol, we promote and maintain a culture of respect and appreciation of differences in our employees.  The Company generally relies on local management in every business unit to foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and a deep commitment to our people and the local community.  A key hallmark of our structure is our entrepreneurial culture that creates clear accountability for each of our general managers, who are our key business leaders.  Our core management team is comprised of these general managers and their controllers, as well as our group general managers and executive management team.  Women represented 26% of this core management team at the end of 2023.  Of our total employees worldwide, approximately half are women.\n​\nHealth, Safety and Well-being\n– We believe that the protection of our employees is a moral obligation.  In addition, the safety and well-being of our employees is critical to the successful operation of our business.  Our health and safety activities are overseen by our corporate environmental, health, safety and sustainability leadership team and are managed by our local teams, who coordinate on-site safety programs, resources, reporting and training in our facilities. We believe that this model of coaching and tracking at the corporate level, but administering at the facility level, has allowed us to provide training and supervision that better fits the local needs of each of our workforces.\n​\nCompensation and Benefits\n– The Company is focused on providing our employees around the world equitable and competitive compensation and benefits.  In the U.S., in addition to competitive compensation, the Company maintains various employee benefits such as health and related insurance, retirement savings programs and health savings and flexible spending accounts.  Outside the U.S., we maintain compensation and other benefits competitive with local market conditions.\n​\nCommunity and Social Impact\n– Amphenol recognizes that we have a responsibility to be a positive influence in the communities in which we operate around the world.  Most of our community outreach is organized by our local management teams, which helps ensure that our efforts are working in support of the local communities in which our\n11\nemployees live and work.  Our local teams are actively supporting their communities in a variety of ways including: school supply drives, local blood drives, mentoring of at-risk students, community clean-up events, local tree planting, holiday-giving events and food delivery services.\n​\nAvailable Information\n​\nThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, including Amphenol, that file with the SEC.  Any such documents that the Company files with the SEC can be obtained by the public on the SEC’s website at\nhttp://www.sec.gov\n.

    "text": "​\nThe Company’s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and stock price can be negatively affected by many risk factors.  Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this Annual Report.  The Company’s past financial performance, including historical trends, should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that we currently consider immaterial may materialize and impair the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and/or stock price.\n​\nIf actions taken by management to limit, monitor or control enterprise risk exposures are not successful, the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  In such case, the trading price of the Company’s Common Stock and debt securities could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\n​\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS\n​\nThe Company is exposed to political, economic, military and other risks related to operating in countries outside the United States, and changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company’s control may adversely impact its business and operating results.\n​\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.  During 2023, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 65% of the Company’s net sales, with China constituting approximately 23% of the Company’s net sales. The Company employs nearly 90% of its workforce outside the United States. The Company’s customers are located throughout the world, and the Company has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States.\n​\nDuring the last few years there have also been significant changes to U.S. trade policies, sanctions, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including, but not limited to, trade policies and tariffs affecting China.  These changes have, in certain cases, increased our costs of doing business.  The imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets and may cause our customers to find alternative sourcing or could make it more difficult for us to sell our products in some markets.  Other countries where we operate or sell our products have changed, and may continue to change, their own policies on trade as well as business and foreign investment in their respective countries.  For example, we have manufacturing facilities in certain jurisdictions that are authorized to operate under preferential duty and/or tariff programs that provide for reduced tariffs and/or eased import and export regulations and are subject to compliance with the terms of such programs, which have become stricter.  Failure to comply with the terms of such programs could increase our manufacturing costs and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations.  As a result of these dynamics, we cannot predict the\n12\nimpact to our business of any future changes to the U.S.’s or other countries’ trading relationships or the impact of new laws or regulations adopted by the U.S. or other countries.\n​\nIn addition to the risks noted above, a number of other legal, economic and geopolitical factors both in the United States and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of operations, such as:\n​\n​\nWe may be negatively impacted by adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics.\n​\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.  Beginning in early 2020 and continuing through 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic\ndisrupted our offices and manufacturing facilities around the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers.\nThese disruptions included government regulations that inhibited our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course, travel restrictions, supplier constraints, supply chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers.  Future disruptions from similar harmful public health developments could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\n​\nThe Company and certain of its suppliers and customers have experienced difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of certain of the Company’s raw materials and components is increasing.\n​\nThe Company uses basic materials like aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, palladium and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes as well as a variety of components and relies on third-party suppliers to secure these materials and components.\nWhile the Company does not currently anticipate significant, broad-based difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production, inflationary pressures and logistical challenges may impact the cost and availability of certain raw materials and components used by the Company and result in supply shortages for discrete raw materials or components, which could be further exacerbated by increased commodity prices and additional inflation.  Moreover, the Company may not be able to pass along any increased raw material or component prices to its customers and may not be able to procure and obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials and components timely and at acceptable prices from our suppliers.  In limited instances, we depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers.  Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, and any delay could impair our\n13\nability to deliver products to our customers.  The cost and availability of raw materials may fluctuate significantly due to external factors including, but not limited to, product scarcity, war or other armed conflict, logistical challenges, disruptions caused by climate change and adverse weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, governmental policies and regulations such as trade tariffs and import restrictions, as well as pandemics and epidemics (as was the case with the COVID-19 pandemic), which may, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n​\nCybersecurity incidents affecting our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential or personal information, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations, fines and other penalties.\n​\nWe rely on our information technology systems for critical operations and face numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and techniques used to disrupt operations and gain unauthorized access to these systems.  These threats may arise from diverse threat actors such as state-sponsored organizations and opportunistic hackers and hacktivists, as well as through diverse attack vectors, including, but not limited to, malware, social engineering/phishing, credential harvesting, ransomware, malfeasance by insiders, human or technological error and other increasingly sophisticated attacks.  Cyberattacks continue to expand and evolve, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company.  Globally, there continues to be an increased volume of cyber threats, ransomware attempts and social engineering attacks, such as phishing and impersonation, and attackers increasingly use tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence.  In addition, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning has led to more sophisticated and deceptive attacks.  Attackers can manipulate systems in new ways and more easily perform functions at scale.  As a result, we may be unable to detect, investigate, remediate, or recover from future attacks or incidents, or avoid a material adverse impact to our business.\n​\nIn addition, global remote working dynamics continue to present additional risk that threat actors will engage in social engineering (for example, phishing) and exploit vulnerabilities in corporate and non-corporate networks.  Ransomware attacks have become easier to execute, and with the rise of ransomware as a service, it has become an increasingly popular business model to lease or sell ransomware variants to anyone willing to pay the fee.\n​\nThere can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully complied with or effective in protecting our information technology systems. The Company and third-party providers upon whom we may rely for certain information technology services have been, and expect to continue to be, a target of various cybersecurity attacks, including, but not limited to, ransomware attacks.  While the impact of such attacks has not been material, future cybersecurity incidents could lead to unauthorized access to and potentially impair the Company’s information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third-party service providers.  Cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations and/or misappropriation, destruction or corruption of critical data and confidential, personal, or proprietary information.  Cybersecurity events could also result in the loss of or inability to access confidential information and critical business, financial or other data, and/or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential or personal information.  Cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraudulent or other means of deceiving our employees, suppliers or third-party service providers.  Our and key third-party information technology systems and infrastructure are susceptible to disruptions from cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, security breaches, computer viruses, security vulnerabilities or “bugs” in software or hardware, outages, systems failures, natural disasters, adverse public health developments, or other catastrophic events, any of which could result in reputational damage that may cause the loss of existing or future customers, the loss of our intellectual property, the release of highly sensitive confidential or personal information, the inability to access critical data and other operational disruptions, litigation with third parties (including class actions) and/or governmental investigations and fines, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Finally, we cannot guarantee that any costs and liabilities incurred in relation to an attack or incident will be covered by our existing insurance policies or that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all.\n​\nWe and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world.  This data relates to all aspects of our business, including financial information and current and future products under development, and also contains certain customer, supplier, partner and employee data, such as personal information.  There is a risk of intrusion, cyberattacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data or make the data inaccessible to us.  In addition, in certain cases, in order to conduct business, we outsource to\n14\nthird-party business partners.  Those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or a cyberattack.  Any compromise of the data could substantially disrupt our operations, impact future business opportunities, harm our customers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations and subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities, including litigation or other enforcement actions.\n​\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements.  Privacy laws and regulations around the world including, for example, in the European Union (“EU”), People’s Republic of China, the state of California, and several other U.S. states, impose significant obligations for companies on how they collect, store, protect, process and transfer personal information and can impose significant fines for non-compliance.  In addition, in March 2022, the U.S. enacted the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act, which imposes cyber incident and ransomware attack response protocols for businesses operating in numerous core industry sectors of the U.S. economy.  The potential for fines, penalties, and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-compliance with any existing and forthcoming information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results.  For further discussion of the Company’s risk management, strategy, and governance around cybersecurity, refer to Part I, Item 1C.\nCybersecurity\nherein.\n​\nThe Company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused or intensified by climate change and global warming.\n​\nFrom time to time, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, portions of our operations, as well as the operations of our suppliers, vendors, customers and distributors.  Such unpredictable weather conditions and\nnatural disasters including, but not limited to, severe storms, earthquakes, fires, droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes\n, and stronger and longer-lasting weather patterns, including heat waves and freezes and ambient temperature or precipitation changes, and their consequences and effects have, in the past, temporarily disrupted our business operations both in the United States and abroad.  These events could cause some of the Company’s operations to suffer from supply chain disruptions and potential delays in fulfilling customer orders or order cancellations altogether, lost business and sales, increased costs, energy and water scarcity, changing costs or availability of insurance, and/or property damage or harm to our people, each and all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nIncreasing scrutiny and expectations regarding ESG matters could result in additional costs or risks or otherwise adversely impact our business.\n​\nCompanies across industries continue to face increasing scrutiny from a variety of stakeholders related to their ESG and sustainability practices. Expectations regarding voluntary and potential mandatory ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs, changes in demand for certain products, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, an inability to receive or maintain favorable ESG ratings could negatively impact our reputation or impede our ability to compete as effectively to attract and retain employees or customers, which may adversely impact our operations.  Unfavorable ESG ratings could also lead to increased negative investor sentiment towards us or our industry, which could negatively impact the share price of our Common Stock as well as our access to and cost of capital.\n​\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners.\n​\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities.  These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities.  In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“FCPA”).  As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA.  In addition, some of the foreign locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws.\n​\n15\nThere can be no assurance that our policies and procedures designed for complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations will be effective in preventing our directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents from taking actions that violate these legal requirements.  Violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures.  In addition, any actual or alleged violations could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n​\nThe Company’s results can be positively or negatively affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n​\nThe Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result, is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies, including possible foreign currency restrictions and/or devaluations.  Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity.  There can be no assurance that any or all actions taken by the Company to mitigate currency risk, such as locating factories in the same country or region in which products are sold, hedging contracts, cost reduction and pricing actions or working capital management, will be fully effective in successfully managing currency risk.  A significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n​\nThe Company is dependent on attracting, recruiting, hiring and retaining skilled employees, including our various management teams.\n​\nOur performance is dependent on our ability to attract, recruit, hire and retain skilled personnel, including our executive and core management teams.  Given the current inflationary wage environment and strong demand for skilled labor in many of the countries and regions in which we operate, the ability to identify and attract new talent, as well as retain existing talent, may prove to be difficult.  It is possible that the current labor market could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract, recruit, hire and retain skilled employees, which in turn, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, our business could also be adversely impacted by the ongoing increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits.\n​\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR END MARKETS\n​\nThe Company encounters competition in all areas of our business.\n​\nThe Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium- to small-sized companies.  Rapid technological changes could also lead to the entry of new competitors of various sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nThe Company is dependent on end market dynamics to sell its products, particularly in the communications, automotive and defense end markets.\n​\nThe Company is dependent on end market dynamics to sell its products, and its operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in any of these markets. Approximately 37% of the Company’s 2023 net sales came from sales to the communications industry.  Demand for products in these markets is generally subject to rapid technological change and/or capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems, all of which could be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the industry, the financial condition of operators and their access to financing, competition, technological developments, new legislation and regulation.  Approximately 23% of the Company’s net sales came from the automotive industry. The automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions, or as a result of prolonged work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions.  The communications and automotive end markets are also dominated by large customers that regularly exert price pressures on their suppliers, including the Company.  Approximately 11% of the Company’s net sales came from sales to the defense end market.  Accordingly, the Company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and\n16\nforeign governments, which are subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints.  Periodic downturns in any of our customers’ end markets can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nRISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS\n​\nThe Company has at times experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses.\n​\nThe Company has completed numerous acquisitions in recent years, including 10 in 2023.  The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy.  From time to time, the Company experiences difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating acquisitions, and acquisitions do not always perform and deliver the financial benefits expected.  The Company has also experienced challenges at times following the acquisition of a new company or business, including, but not limited to, managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; maintaining and increasing the customer base; or retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors.  In certain limited cases, the Company has pursued indemnification claims against seller(s) of an acquired business or sought recovery under third party insurance policies for pre-acquisition liabilities, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants or for other reasons provided for in the relevant acquisition agreement or insurance policy.  To the extent we pursue indemnification claims against such seller(s) or insurers, such seller(s) or insurers may successfully contest such claims and/or may not have the financial capacity to compensate us for such claims, or such claims may otherwise be difficult or impractical to enforce.  We cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings, benefits, margin improvements and growth prospects will be achieved from recent or future acquisitions.\n​\nThe Company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges.\n​\nOn December 31, 2023, the total assets of the Company were $16.5 billion,\nwhich included $7.1 billion of goodwill (the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired) and $834.8 million of other intangible assets, net.  The Company performs annual evaluations (or more frequently, if necessary) for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.  Such evaluations to date have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Company’s businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a material non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.  Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes more severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.\n​\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n​\nThe Company’s credit agreements and senior notes contain certain requirements, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n​\nThe second amended and restated credit agreement that governs our $2.5 billion unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which also backstops the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program (“U.S. Commercial Paper Program”) and Euro commercial paper program (“Euro Commercial Paper Program”), contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens.  The Company also has similar financial and other covenants associated with its two-year, $750.0 million unsecured delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the “Term Loan”) entered into in April 2022.  In addition, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company’s control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests.  A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan.  Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, which could result in the acceleration of certain of the Company’s other indebtedness and the Company not having sufficient assets to repay indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan and such other debt instruments.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program.  However, the Company borrowed under the U.S.\n17\nCommercial Paper Program throughout much of 2023, and the Company may make additional borrowings under any of its debt instruments from time to time.\n​\nIn addition to these credit agreements, the Company’s various senior notes also impose certain obligations on the Company and prohibit various actions by the Company unless it satisfies certain financial requirements.  While the Company is compliant with all such requirements as of December 31, 2023, there can be no assurance that the Company will remain in compliance with such requirements.\n​\nThe Company relies on the global capital markets, and an inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Company’s results.\n​\nThe Company has used the global capital markets to raise capital to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions.  The capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past.  If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could become more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments, acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  In addition, if the credit rating agencies that rate the Company’s debt were to downgrade the Company’s credit rating, it would likely increase the Company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing and access capital markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\nThe Company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates\n.\n​\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt.  The Company monitors its mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as its mix of short-term and long-term debt.  As of December\n31, 2023, less than 1% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates.\n​\nAs a result of increases in the federal funds rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve beginning in early 2022 and through the middle of 2023, t\nhe floating interest rates related to our U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as well as our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, to the extent either are drawn upon in the future) have increased substantially over this same period, a trend that could continue into 2024 and potentially beyond.\nTo the extent that interest rates related to this floating rate debt increase further and the Company borrows under any of these floating interest rate instruments in the future, interest expense and interest payments would increase.  There can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly from current levels.\n​\nRISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\n​\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks.\n​\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the U.S. and other governments, including laws and regulations governing reporting obligations, interactions with government officials, performance of government contracts, the use and treatment of government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products. We may be unilaterally suspended or barred from conducting business with the U.S. and other foreign governments or their suppliers (both directly and indirectly) or become subject to fines or other sanctions if we are found to have violated such laws or regulations. As a result of the need to comply with these laws and regulations, we are subject to increased risks of governmental investigations, civil fraud actions, criminal prosecutions, whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions.  For example, th\ne Company reached an agreement in August 2023 with the U.S. government related to an investigation of alleged violations by the Company of the civil False Claims Act.  Although the Company did not admit to any liability under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company agreed to pay the U.S. government a settlement amount, ending the government’s investigation and releasing the Company from further liability for the issues under investigation\n.  The U.S. laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the Export Administration Regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the False Claims Act, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, regulations from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FCPA.  Moreover, we are subject to a wide range of similar laws and regulations in other countries throughout the world.  Failure, or the perceived failure, to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell commercial equivalent products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n​\n18\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the U.S. government without prior written notice, either for convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract.  If our contracts are terminated by the U.S. government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the U.S. government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers.  Furthermore, the U.S. government periodically audits our governmental contract costs, which could result in fines, penalties or adjustment of costs and prices under the contracts.  Any such fines, penalties or payment adjustments resulting from such audits could adversely affect our reputation, business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n​\nThe Company must comply with complex U.S. governmental export and import controls as well as economic sanctions and trade embargoes.\n​\nCertain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. export control laws and regulations, and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception.  In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and non-U.S. economic sanctions and trade embargoes that restrict our ability to transact or deal with certain persons, countries, regions, and governments.  These laws and regulations are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under recent U.S. administrations, especially in light of ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China.  For example, in 2019, the U.S. government added certain of the Company’s customers based in China to the “Entity List” maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which imposes additional restrictions on sales to such customers.  Further, in 2022, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry Security released new export control regulations that restrict the provision to China of certain technology, software, manufacturing equipment and commodities that are used to make certain advanced computing integrated circuits (“ICs”) and supercomputers.  These changes include new restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to provide certain services to any facility in China that manufactures certain advanced ICs.  Although, to date, none of such restrictions have had a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, the U.S. government has the power to place even greater restrictions, and such restrictions could further limit or prohibit the Company from selling its products or providing its services.  In addition, we cannot ensure that our policies and procedures designed to maintain compliance with applicable rules and regulations will be effective in preventing instances of non-compliance.  If we were to fail to comply with applicable export control restrictions (for example, by failing to obtain required export licensing), customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, the incarceration of responsible employees and managers, reputational harm, and the possible loss of export or import privileges.  In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\n​\nChanges in fiscal and tax policies, audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the Company’s results.\n​\nThe Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions.  The Company is currently under tax examination in several jurisdictions, and, in addition, new examinations could be initiated by additional tax authorities.  As the Company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world, the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur.  The Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations.\n​\nOn August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), a tax and spending package that introduces several tax-related provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases.  Companies will be required to reassess their valuation allowances for certain affected deferred tax assets in the period of enactment but will not need to remeasure deferred tax balances for the related tax accounting implications of the CAMT.  Th\ne IRA provisions, which became effective for Amphenol beginning on January 1, 2023\n, did not have a material impact on the Company during the year ended December 31, 2023.  However, the full impact of these provisions in the future depends on several factors, including interpretive regulatory guidance, which has not yet been released.\n​\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework, known as Pillar Two, provides guidance for a global minimum tax.  This guidance lays out a common approach for adopting the global minimum tax and enacting local legislation codifying the provisions that all 142 countries in the Inclusive Framework agreed to by consensus.  The EU member states have agreed to adopt these rules in two stages with the first component effective on January 1, 2024, while the second component will be effective January 1, 2025.  Non-EU\n19\ncountries have enacted or are expected to enact legislation on a similar timeline.  Certain countries in which we operate have already enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework, while several other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation with varying effective dates in the future. When and how this framework is adopted or enacted by the various countries in which we do business will increase tax complexity and may increase uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n​\nAny future changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting standards for income taxes and/or other tax guidance, including related interpretations associated with the IRA or otherwise, could materially impact the Company’s current and non-current tax liabilities, along with deferred tax assets and liabilities, and consequently, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\nWe may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.\n​\nWe rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and, from time to time, we encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights, particularly in certain countries outside the U.S.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in laws concerning intellectual property, or the enforcement of such laws, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.\n​\nThe intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties may include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  In addition, some foreign competitors may take advantage of the intellectual property laws in their home countries and the more favorable litigation and regulatory environment to our detriment.  Third-party claims of infringement may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.\n​\nThe Company is subject to customer claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings.\n​\nThe Company is currently engaged in, or subject to, various customer claims, litigation and other regulatory and legal matters and may be subject to additional claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings in the future. Such matters expose the Company to risks that could be material, including, but not limited to, risks related to employment disputes, tax controversies, government investigations, intellectual property infringement, compliance with environmental laws, unfair sales practices, product safety and liability, and product warranty, indemnity and other contract-related claims.  These matters may subject the Company to lawsuits, voluntary or forced product recalls, government investigations and criminal liability, including claims for compensatory, punitive or consequential damages, and could result in disruptions to our business and significant legal expense\ns.  These matters could also damage our reputation, harm our relationships with customers or negatively affect product demand.\n​\nWhile the Company does maintain certain insurance coverages that may mitigate losses associated with some of these types of claims and proceedings, the policies may not apply and, where insurance exists, the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities.  In some cases, particularly with respect to product warranty claims from customers, we self-insure against this risk, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from Company funds and not by insurance.  Any current or future substantial liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and reputation.\n​\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business.\n​\nThe Company operates in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we must comply with locally enacted laws and regulations addressing health, safety and environmental matters in such jurisdictions in which we\n20\nmanufacture and/or sell our products.  Certain operations of the Company are subject to locally enacted environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.  The Company and its operations may be subject to liabilities, regardless of fault, for investigative and/or remediation efforts on such matters that may arise at any of the Company’s former or current properties, either owned or leased.  Environmental liabilities can result from the use of hazardous materials in production, the disposal of products, damages associated with the use of any of our products or other related matters.  We cannot be certain as to the potential impact of any changes to environmental conditions or environmental policies that may arise in any of our jurisdictions.  Our failure to comply with these local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other punitive damages and/or modifications to our production processes as well as subject us to reputational harm, any of which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows\n.\n​\nThe Company is subject to, and may continue to be subject to, incremental costs, risks and regulations associated with efforts to combat the negative effects of climate change.\n​\nThere is increased public awareness regarding climate change.  This increased focus has led to international treaties and agreements and legislative and regulatory efforts.  In addition to the risks discussed under the risk factors titled “\nThe Company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused or intensified by climate change and global warming\n” and “\nIncreasing scrutiny and expectations regarding ESG matters could result in additional costs or risks or otherwise adversely impact our business\n,” the Company may also be subject to larger, global climate change initiatives, laws, regulations or orders, such as any laws or regulations to implement the Paris Climate Agreement, which seek to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions.  In addition to government requirements, our customers are also increasingly imposing climate-related requirements on their suppliers, including us.  Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with these requirements may result in reduced demand for our products, reputational harm, or other adverse impacts to our business.\n​\nGiven our global manufacturing presence, any future regulations relating to GHG emissions and/or other climate change-related laws and regulations, beyond initiatives already in process at the Company, could subject us to additional and/or unforeseen compliance costs and limitations, increased energy and raw material costs and incremental capital expenditure requirements.  In addition, governmental bodies are increasingly adopting and considering adopting additional mandatory climate-related reporting obligations, and potentially GHG emissions reduction requirements, and these regulatory developments, to the extent we are subject to them, will likely result in increased corporate and operational general and administrative efforts and associated costs and expenses.\n​\nThere have been various new laws around the world that have been passed and will require additional ESG-related disclosure.  For example, in Europe, the EU finalized the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), which introduces more prescriptive sustainability reporting requirements for EU companies as well as certain non-EU companies, and will apply to all in-scope companies by January 1, 2028.  In the United States, the SEC has proposed climate-related disclosure rules that have not yet been enacted as of the date of this report, and certain states have begun to pass their own ESG-related laws.  For example, on October 7, 2023, the governor of California signed and enacted into law two climate-related disclosure bills (\nSB-253, Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act\nand\nSB-261, Greenhouse Gases: Climate-Related Financial Risk\n), which will require compliance as early as 2026.\n​\nAny future regulatory changes in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in transition risks to the Company, including, but not limited to: (i) the nature and timing of any requirement to lower GHG emissions and adopt more energy-efficient energy use, which could result in changes or disruptions to the way the Company operates, (ii) financial risks where the compliance with such regulations requires unforeseen capital expenditures and becomes costly or financially burdensome, (iii) legal risks associated with the failure to adapt to or comply with future climate change-related regulations, (iv) risks of climate litigation associated with our disclosures and/or operations; (v) risks associated with the implementation of any new technologies required to comply with such regulations, which could impede our ability to develop new products, meet customer and market demand or compete on pricing and quality in the market, and/or (vi) reputational risks associated with our customers’ and investors’ perceptions of the Company and their preferences for maintaining relationships with companies with lower emissions, all of which could harm our reputation in the marketplace.\n​"

Our Program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program.  We use the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (the “NIST CSF”) as a benchmark to ensure that our Program is maintained in line with industry best practices. This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications or requirements, but it does mean that we use the NIST CSF as a guide to help us identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.\n​\nThe Company maintains a decentralized information technology infrastructure, where each of our business units utilizes a separate and distinct information technology system.  This means that if any business unit’s systems are compromised, there is significantly less risk that another business unit will be impacted by that event.  This decentralized structure also allows our information security professionals embedded within an individual business unit to make quick, efficient decisions when changes or actions are needed and provides an additional safeguard for our data and systems.\n​\nOur Program includes:\n​\n​\nWe have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior security breach, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, financial condition and results of operations.   We face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\nFor a discussion of certain risks related to cybersecurity, refer to the risk factor titled “\nCybersecurity incidents affecting our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential or personal information, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations, fines and other penalties\n” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.\n​\nCybersecurity Governance\n​\nOur Board maintains oversight responsibility relating to our Program, with assistance from the Audit Committee\n.\nAt least annually, our management team (including the leaders of our Information Technology and Internal Audit teams) provides an update regarding our Program to the Board. This update provides an overall assessment of the effectiveness of our Program and a review of areas of focus for the upcoming year. The Board also receives periodic reports from our Vice President, Internal Audit, on the audit focus areas and control testing related to our information security systems\n22\nand security controls, and our management team updates the Board, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents.\n​\nOur management team, including our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Vice President, Information Technology, and Vice President, Internal Audit, is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The team has primary responsibility for our Program and our Vice President, Information Technology, supervises both our internal information security personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our management team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal information technology personnel and external consultants engaged by us, as well as alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our information technology environment.\n​\nOur management team’s experience includes knowledge related to information technology, cybersecurity and incidence response, risk management,\ncontrol analysis and corporate governance.

The Company’s Common Stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since that time under the ticker symbol “APH”.  As of January\n31, 2024, there were 31 holders of record of the Company’s Common Stock.  A significant number of outstanding shares of Common Stock are registered in the name of only one holder, which is a nominee of The Depository Trust Company, a securities depository for banks and brokerage firms.  The Company believes that there are a significant number of beneficial owners of its Common Stock.\n​\nStock Performance Graph\n​\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return of Amphenol over a period of five years ending December 31, 2023 with the performance of the Standard\n& Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”) Stock Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Electrical Components & Equipment Index.  This graph assumes that $100 was invested in our Common Stock and each index on December\n31, 2018, reflects reinvested dividends, and is weighted on a market capitalization basis as of the beginning of each year.  Each reported data point below represents the last trading day of each calendar year.  The comparisons in the graph below are based upon historical data and are not indicative of, nor intended to forecast, future performance.\nDividends\n​\nContingent upon declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), the Company pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock.\n​\n24\nThe following table sets forth the dividends declared per common share for each quarter of 2023 and 2022:\n​\n​\nDividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(in millions)\nwere as follows:\n​\n​\nAmphenol has a history of paying quarterly cash dividends.  While the Company currently expects a cash dividend to be paid in the future, future dividend payments remain within the discretion of the Board and are dependent on our financial results, liquidity, capital requirements, financial condition, compliance with financial covenants and requirements, and other factors considered relevant by the Board.\n​\nRepurchase of Equity Securities\n​\nOn April 27, 2021, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 27, 2024 (the “2021 Stock Repurchase Program”).  During the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 1.3 million and 7.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $115.3 million and $585.1 million, respectively, under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program.  Of the total repurchases made in 2023, 5.5 million shares, or $435.8 million, have been retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase.  From January 1, 2024 through January 31, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any additional shares of its Common Stock, and, as of February 1, 2024, the Company has remaining authorization to purchase up to $226.5 million of its Common Stock under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program.  The timing and amount of any future purchases will depend on a number of factors, such as the levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock options exercised by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends paid, economic and market conditions and the price of the Common Stock.\n​\nThe Company’s stock repurchases during the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n​\n​\n​"

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”).  Any references to the Company’s results in this Item 7 are specifically to our continuing operations only and exclude discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted.\nThe following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, including “Constant Currency Net Sales Growth” and “Organic Net Sales Growth”.  For purposes of the following discussion, the terms “constant currencies” and “organically” have the same meaning, respectively, as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures.  Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this Item 7 for more information, including our reasons for including non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures.\n​\nIn addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis also contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nherein, as well as the risks and uncertainties that exist with the use of forward-looking statements as described in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section included herein at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”).\n​\nOverview\n​\nGeneral\n​\nAmphenol is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors and interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable.  In 2023, approximately 65% of the Company’s sales were outside the United States.  The primary end markets for our products are:\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThe Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by a broad array of customers around the world.  The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time.  For many years, customers have generally been consolidating their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining geographic flexibility and competitive prices.  The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment.  The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage, as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers, while at the same time offering a level of resiliency and diversification against local risks and challenges that may emerge in any single geography.\n​\n26\nReportable Business Segments\n​\nThe Company aligns its businesses into the following three reportable business segments:\n​\n●\nHarsh Environment Solutions\n– the Harsh Environment Solutions segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of ruggedized interconnect products, including connectors and interconnect systems, printed circuits and printed circuit assemblies and other products for use in the industrial, defense, commercial aerospace, automotive, mobile networks and information technology and data communications end markets.\n​\n●\nCommunications Solutions\n– the Communications Solutions segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of connector and interconnect systems, including high speed, radio frequency, power, fiber optic and other products, together with antennas, for use in the information technology and data communications, mobile devices, industrial, mobile networks, broadband communications, automotive, commercial aerospace and defense end markets.\n​\n●\nInterconnect and Sensor Systems\n– the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of sensors, sensor-based systems, connectors and value-add interconnect systems used in the automotive, industrial, information technology and data communications, mobile networks, defense and commercial aerospace end markets.\n​\nThis alignment reinforces the Company’s entrepreneurial culture and the clear accountability of each of our business unit general managers, while enhancing the scalability of Amphenol’s business for the future.  F\nor further details related to the Company’s reportable business segments, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein.\n​\nStrategy\n​\nThe Company’s strategy is to provide our customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of quality and service on a worldwide basis, while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control.  The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its customers to develop highly engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period.  The Company is also focused on controlling costs.  The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas.\n​\nThe Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors:\n​\n​\nIn 2023\n, the Company reported net sales and operating income of $12,554.7 and $2,559.6, respectively, each representing a decrease of 1% from 2022, while net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $1,928.0 represented an increase of 1% from 2022.  In 2023, the Company’s net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by (a) excess tax benefits of $82.4 related to stock-based compensation resulting from stock option exercises and (b) the gain of $5.4 on a bargain purchase acquisition that closed in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by\n(c) acquisition-related expenses of $34.6 ($30.2 after-tax) comprised primarily of external transaction costs, as well as the amortization of $12.4 related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from three of the acquisitions that closed in 2023\n.\nIn 2022, the Company’s net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by (a) excess tax benefits of $56.0 related to stock-based compensation resulting from stock option exercises, partially offset by (b) acquisition-related expenses of $21.5 ($18.4 after-tax) comprised primarily of the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from two acquisitions that closed in 2022, along with external transaction costs.\nExcluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income decreased by 1%, while Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation increased slightly in 2023 compared to 2022.  Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net\n27\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation are both non-GAAP financial measures, each as defined\nin the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and reconciled within this Part II, Item 7.\nSales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below.  In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations (“Operating Cash Flow”).\nThe Company uses Operating Cash Flow to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”), pay dividends and reduce indebtedness.  In 2023, the Company generated Operating Cash Flow of $2,528.7 and Free Cash Flow of $2,159.9, compared to Operating Cash Flow of $2,174.6 and Free Cash Flow of $1,796.4 in 2022.  Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and reconciled within this Part II, Item 7.\n​\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\n​\nOn August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), a tax and spending package that introduces several tax-related provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases.  Companies will be required to reassess their valuation allowances for certain affected deferred tax assets in the period of enactment but will not need to remeasure deferred tax balances for the related tax accounting implications of the CAMT.  The IRA provisions, which became effective for Amphenol beginning on January 1, 2023, did not have a material impact on the Company during the year ended December 31, 2023.  While the full impact of these provisions in the future depends on several factors, including interpretive regulatory guidance, which has not yet been released, the Company does not currently believe that the provisions of the IRA, including several other non-tax related provisions, will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\n​\nPillar Two Framework\n​\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework, known as Pillar Two, provides guidance for a global minimum tax.  This guidance lays out a common approach for adopting the global minimum tax and enacting local legislation codifying the provisions that all 142 countries in the Inclusive Framework agreed to by consensus.  The European Union (“EU”) member states have agreed to adopt these rules in two stages with the first component effective on January 1, 2024, while the second component will be effective January 1, 2025.  Non-EU countries have enacted or are expected to enact legislation on a similar timeline.  Certain countries in which we operate have already enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework, while several other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation with varying effective dates in the future. When and how this framework is adopted or enacted by the various countries in which we do business will increase tax complexity and may increase uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has done a preliminary review of currently enacted legislation and does not expect the initial implementation to materially impact future results.  However, the Company will continue to evaluate the potential impact of Pillar Two on the Company and its future results, as additional countries adopt legislation and issue individual guidance on their enacted legislation.\n​\n28\nResults of Operations\n​\nThe following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated.\n​\nNote: Percentages in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding.\n​\n2023 Compared to 2022\n​\nNet sales were $12,554.7 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $12,623.0 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which represented a decrease of 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts), while flat in constant currencies compared to the prior year.  The decrease in net sales in 2023 was driven by a sales decline in the Communications Solutions segment, partially offset by growth in the Harsh Environment Solutions and Interconnect and Sensor Systems segments, as described below.  From an end market standpoint, the decrease in net sales was driven by organic declines in the information technology and data communications (“IT datacom”), mobile networks, mobile devices, industrial and broadband communications markets, partially offset by robust organic growth in the automotive, defense and commercial aerospace markets, along with contributions from the Company’s acquisition program.  Net sales to the automotive market increased approximately $310.5, reflecting broad-based strength across our global automotive markets, in particular, next-generation electronics, including electric and hybrid drive trains.  Net sales to the defense market increased approximately $237.6, driven by broad-based strength across virtually all defense applications, particularly related to naval, aircraft engines, helicopters, communications, and space-related applications, as well as contributions from acquisitions.  Net sales to the commercial aerospace market increased approximately $117.9, primarily due to increased broad-based demand across all aircraft applications, in particular larger passenger planes.  Net sales to the industrial market remained flat, as contributions from acquisitions, along with growth in medical, oil and gas, mass transit and transportation applications were offset by moderations in industrial instrumentation, battery and electric heavy vehicles, factory automation and heavy equipment applications.  Net sales to the IT datacom market decreased approximately $362.8, as we experienced moderations across a broad array of applications including networking equipment, cloud storage, transmission, consumer electronics and servers, partially offset by strong growth in artificial intelligence-related applications.  Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased approximately $163.9, driven by broad-based moderations in demand from mobile network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers, partially offset by contributions from acquisitions.  Net sales to the mobile devices market decreased approximately $161.5, driven by declines in sales in laptops, wearable devices, tablets and production-related products, partially offset by growth in smartphones.  Net sales to the broadband communications market decreased approximately $46.4, driven by moderations in demand from broadband service operators.\n​\nNet sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment (approximately 28% of net sales) increased 14% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currencies and 9% organically, in 2023, compared to 2022.  The sales growth in 2023 was primarily driven by strong organic growth in the defense, commercial aerospace, automotive and IT datacom markets, along with contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, partially offset by organic declines in the industrial and mobile networks markets.\n​\n29\nNet sales in the Communications Solutions segment (approximately 39% of net sales) decreased 13% in U.S. dollars, 12% in constant currencies and 13% organically, in 2023, compared to 2022.  The sales decline in 2023 was primarily driven by organic declines in the IT datacom, industrial, mobile networks, mobile devices and broadband communications markets, partially offset by strong organic growth in the automotive market, along with modest contributions from the Company’s acquisition program.\n​\nNet sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment (approximately 33% of net sales) increased 6% in U.S. dollars, 7% in constant currencies and 3% organically, in 2023, compared to 2022.  The sales growth in 2023 was primarily driven by strong organic growth in the automotive and commercial aerospace markets, and moderate growth in the industrial and defense markets, along with contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, partially offset by organic declines in the IT datacom and mobile networks markets.\n​\nThe table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment, geography and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022:\n​\n​\n​\nThe decrease in foreign net sales in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by sales declines in Asia.  The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2023 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $61.1, compared to 2022.\n​\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $1,489.9, or 11.9% of net sales for 2023, compared to $1,420.9, or 11.3% of net sales, for 2022.  The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2023 was primarily driven by the effect of acquisitions, which currently have higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales compared to the Company average.  Administrative expenses increased $26.2 in 2023 and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in 2023 and 4.6% of net sales in 2022.  Research and development expenses increased $18.6 in 2023, primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development, and represented approximately 2.7% of net sales in 2023 and 2.6% of net sales in 2022.  Selling and marketing expenses increased $24.2 in 2023 compared to 2022, and represented approximately 4.3% of net sales in 2023 and 4.1% of net sales in 2022.\n​\nOperating income was $2,559.6, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2023, compared to $2,585.8, or 20.5% of net sales, in 2022.\nOperating income in 2023 included acquisition-related expenses of $34.6, comprised primarily of external transaction costs, as well as the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from three of the acquisitions that closed in 2023.  Operating income in 2022 included acquisition-related expenses of $21.5,\n30\ncomprised primarily of the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from two acquisitions that closed in 2022, along with external transaction costs. The acquisition-related expenses in 2023 and 2022 had the effect of decreasing net income from continuing operations by $30.2, or $0.05 per share, and $18.4, or $0.03 per share, respectively.  Acquisition-related expenses are presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, each as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $2,594.2 and 20.7% of net sales, respectively, in 2023, and $2,607.3 and 20.7% of net sales, respectively, in 2022.  While Adjusted Operating Income decreased modestly from 2022, Adjusted Operating Margin remained flat in 2023 relative to 2022, as the benefit of pricing actions and strong operational performance were offset by the operating leverage on the lower sales volumes, along with the negative impact on operating margin related to acquisitions that are currently operating below the average operating margin of the Company.\n​\nOperating income for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment in 2023 was $943.9, or 26.7% of net sales, compared to $801.6, or 25.8% of net sales in 2022. The increase in operating margin for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and strong operational performance, combined with the benefit of pricing actions, all partially offset by the negative impact on operating margin related to acquisitions that are currently operating below the average operating margin of the Company.\n​\nOperating income for the Communications Solutions segment in 2023 was $1,063.5, or 21.6% of net sales, compared to $1,245.7, or 22.0% of net sales in 2022. The decrease in operating margin for the Communications Solutions segment for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by operating leverage on the lower sales volumes, partially offset by the benefit of pricing actions and strong operational performance.\n​\nOperating income for the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment in 2023 was $753.7, or 18.3% of net sales, compared to $716.5, or 18.5% of net sales in 2022.  The modest decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by the negative impact on operating margin related to acquisitions that are currently operating below the average operating margin of the Company, partially offset by the normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes combined with the benefit of pricing actions.\n​\nInterest expense was $139.5 in 2023 compared to $128.4 in 2022.  The increase in interest expense was driven by the higher interest rate environment, which primarily impacted borrowings under the Company’s U.S. Commercial Paper Program that were outstanding throughout much of 2023.  Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.\n​\nProvision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 20.7% in 2023 and 22.3% in 2022.  Provision for income taxes in 2023 included excess tax benefits of $82.4 from stock option exercises as well as the effect of the gain from the bargain purchase acquisition that closed in the second quarter of 2023, all of which were partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year.  These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below.  Provision for income taxes in 2022 included excess tax benefits of $56.0 from stock option exercises, partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year.  These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below.  Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, was 24.0% and 24.5% for 2023 and 2022, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results.  For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income from continuing operations per common share attributable to Amphenol Corporation-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) were $1,928.0 and $3.11, respectively, for 2023, compared to $1,902.3 and $3.06, respectively, for 2022. Excluding the effect of the items discussed above, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,870.4 and $3.01, respectively, for 2023, compared to $1,864.7 and $3.00, respectively, for 2022.\n​\n31\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all on a continuing operations basis only, each as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n​\n​\nNote:  All data in the tables above are on a continuing operations basis only and exclude results associated with discontinued operations.\n​\n​\n​\n2022 Compared to 2021\n​\nNet sales were $12,623.0 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $10,876.3 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented an increase of 16% in U.S. dollars, 19% in constant currencies and 15% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) compared to the prior year.  The increase in net sales in 2022 was driven by robust growth across all three reportable business segments, as described below.  From an end market standpoint, the increase in net sales was driven by robust organic growth across most end markets, including the automotive, IT datacom, industrial, broadband communications and commercial aerospace markets, moderate organic growth in the defense, mobile networks and mobile devices markets, and contributions from the Company’s acquisition program.  Net sales to the automotive market increased approximately $470.1, reflecting broad-based growth across our global automotive market, including the Company’s strength in next-generation electronics, in particular electric and hybrid drive trains, power management, infotainment communications, antenna and antenna assemblies, charging stations, and safety and security systems.  Net sales to the IT datacom market increased approximately $414.6, as we continue to benefit from our strong technology solutions and leading position across a broad array of applications as customers continue to support higher demand for increased bandwidth and cloud storage, along with contributions from acquisitions.  Net sales to the industrial market increased approximately $399.7, with broad-based growth across nearly all market segments of the global industrial market, with particular strength in e-mobility applications primarily in heavy and commercial vehicles, along with strong growth in factory automation, alternative energy, medical, and transportation applications, as well as contributions from acquisitions.\nNet sales to the broadband communications market increased approximately $241.2, driven by increased overall demand from broadband service operators related to data network upgrades and expansions, along with contributions from acquisitions.\nNet sales to the commercial aerospace market increased approximately $85.6, primarily due to the continued recovery in travel and demand for aircraft, along with contributions from acquisitions.  Net sales to the defense market increased approximately $47.9, driven by strength in space-related applications, unmanned aerial vehicles, ground vehicles, and avionics, as well as contributions from acquisitions.  Net sales to the mobile networks market increased approximately $46.4, driven by continued recovery in demand from mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators, along with contributions from acquisitions.  Net sales to the mobile devices market increased approximately $41.2, driven by growth in products incorporated into smartphones and wearable devices, partially offset by moderations in sales of tablets, hearable devices and laptops.\n​\nNet sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment (approximately 25% of net sales) increased 13% in U.S. dollars, 16% in constant currencies and 15% organically, in 2022, compared to 2021.  The sales growth in 2022 was driven by strong organic growth in the industrial, automotive and commercial aerospace markets, and moderate organic\n32\ngrowth in the defense, mobile networks and IT datacom markets, along with contributions from the Company’s acquisition program.\n​\nNet sales in the Communications Solutions segment (approximately 45% of net sales) increased 17% in U.S. dollars, 19% in constant currencies and 13% organically, in 2022, compared to 2021.  The sales growth in 2022 was driven by strong organic growth across several end markets, in particular the IT datacom, broadband communications and automotive markets, and moderate organic growth in the mobile devices, industrial and mobile networks markets, along with contributions from the Company’s acquisition program.\n​\nNet sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment (approximately 30% of net sales) increased 17% in U.S. dollars, 23% in constant currencies and 18% organically, in 2022, compared to 2021.  The sales growth in 2022 was primarily driven by strong organic growth in the automotive, industrial, IT datacom, defense and commercial aerospace markets, along with contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, partially offset by a moderate decline in the mobile networks market.\n​\nThe table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment, geography and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021:\n​\n​\n​\nThe increase in foreign net sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by strong growth in both Europe and Asia.  The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2022 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $359.8, compared to 2021.\n​\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $1,420.9, or 11.3% of net sales for 2022, compared to $1,226.3, or 11.3% of net sales, for 2021.  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 remained flat as the leverage on the higher sales volumes during the year was offset by the Sensors business (“MTS Sensors”) of MTS Systems Corporation (“MTS”), acquired in early 2021, having higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales compared to the Company average.  Administrative expenses increased $90.6 in 2022 and represented approximately 4.6% of net sales in 2022 and 4.5% of net sales in 2021.  Research and development expenses increased $5.9 in 2022, primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development, and represented approximately 2.6% of net sales in 2022 and 2.9% of net sales in 2021.  Selling and marketing expenses increased $98.1 in 2022 compared to 2021, and represented approximately 4.1% of net sales in 2022 and 3.8% of net sales in 2021.\n​\n33\nOperating income was $2,585.8, or 20.5% of net sales, in 2022, compared to $2,105.1, or 19.4% of net sales, in 2021.  Operating income in 2022 included acquisition-related expenses of $21.5, comprised primarily of the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from two acquisitions that closed in 2022, along with external transaction costs.  Operating income in 2021 included acquisition-related expenses of $70.4, comprised primarily of transaction, severance, restructuring and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the acquisition of MTS in the second quarter of 2021, along with external transaction costs and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the acquisition of Halo Technology Limited (“Halo”) in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The acquisition-related expenses in 2022 and 2021 had the effect of decreasing net income from continuing operations by $18.4, or $0.03 per share, and $57.3, or $0.09 per share, respectively.  Acquisition-related expenses are presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, each as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $2,607.3 and 20.7% of net sales, respectively, in 2022, and $2,175.5 and 20.0% of net sales, respectively, in 2021.  The increases in Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin in 2022 relative to 2021 was driven by all three segments, as described below.\n​\nOperating income for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment in 2022 was $801.6, or 25.8% of net sales, compared to $708.2, or 25.7% of net sales in 2021. The slight increase in operating margin for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of pricing actions, which were largely offset by the impact of the more challenging cost environment experienced in 2022.\n​\nOperating income for the Communications Solutions segment in 2022 was $1,245.7, or 22.0% of net sales, compared to $1,023.3, or 21.2% of net sales in 2021. The increase in operating margin for the Communications Solutions segment for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of pricing actions, partially offset by the impact of the more challenging cost environment experienced in 2022.\n​\nOperating income for the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment in 2022 was $716.5, or 18.5% of net sales, compared to $588.1, or 17.9% of net sales in 2021. The increase in operating margin for the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of pricing actions, partially offset by the impact of the more challenging cost environment experienced in 2022.\n​\nInterest expense was $128.4 in 2022 compared to $115.5 in 2021.  The increase in interest expense was driven by the higher interest rate environment and its impact on the balance outstanding under the Company’s U.S. Commercial Paper Program.  Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.\n​\nProvision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 22.3% in 2022 and 20.6% in 2021.  Provision for income taxes in 2022 included excess tax benefits of $56.0 from stock option exercises, partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year.  These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below.  Provision for income taxes in 2021 included (i) excess tax benefits of $63.4 from stock option exercises and (ii) a discrete tax benefit of $14.9 related to the settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, all of which were partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year.  These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below.  Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, was 24.5% and 24.3% for 2022 and 2021, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results.  For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Diluted EPS were $1,902.3 and $3.06, respectively, for 2022, compared to $1,569.4 and $2.51, respectively, for 2021. Excluding the effect of the items discussed above, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,864.7 and $3.00, respectively, for 2022, compared to $1,548.4 and $2.48, respectively, for 2021.\n​\n34\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all on a continuing operations basis only, each as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n​\nNote:  All data in the tables above are on a continuing operations basis only and exclude results associated with discontinued operations.\n​\n​\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n​\nLiquidity and Cash Requirements\n​\nAt December\n31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,660.2  and $1,434.2, respectively, with the\nmajority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand located outside of the United States.  The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash provided by operating activities, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, as well as availability under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Term Loan (all of which are defined and discussed in more detail below within this Item 7).  The Company believes that these sources of liquidity, along with access to capital markets (which the Company accessed in March 2023 in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Senior Notes, as defined and discussed in more detail below within this Item 7), provide adequate liquidity to meet both its short-term (next 12 months) and reasonably foreseeable long-term requirements and obligations.\n​\nCash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations\n​\nThe Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and working capital needs, capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of our Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of all of the Company’s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”), which is payable in annual installments until 2025, taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings)\n, funding of pension obligations, and other contractual obligations and commitments (refer to the table below for the Company’s material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations).  The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of future acquisitions, as was the case with our 2023 acquisitions.  The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2024 will be in a range of 3% to 4% of net sales.  The Company’s debt service requirements primarily consist of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, and to the extent of any amounts outstanding, the Revolving Credit Facility, Commercial Paper Programs and the Term Loan (all as defined below).  As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Pro\ngram.  However\n, the Company borrowed under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program throughout much of 2023, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes, and the Company may make additional borrowings under any of its debt instruments in the future.  As a result of increases in the federal funds rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve beginning in early 2022 and through the middle of 2023, the floating interest rates related to our U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as well as our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, to the extent either are drawn upon in the future) have increased substantially over this same period, a trend that could continue into 2024 and potentially beyond.  To the extent that interest rates related to this floating rate debt increase\n35\nfurther and the Company borrows under any of these floating interest rate instruments in the future, interest expense and interest payments would increase.  Although the Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2024, there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly from current levels.\n​\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material short- and long-term cash requirements from known obligations pursuant to certain contracts and commitments as of December 31, 2023, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations and payments are expected to be satisfied.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nRepatriation of Foreign Earnings and Related Income Taxes\n​\nThe Company has previously indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2023 accumulated earnings and has accrued the foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings, as appropriate.  The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made.  The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining pre-2023 foreign earnings.  The Company intends to distribute certain 2023 foreign earnings and, as of December 31, 2023, has accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, where applicable, on those foreign earnings that it intends to repatriate, and intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining 2023 foreign earnings.  The Company intends to (i) evaluate certain post-2023 earnings for repatriation, and will accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and (ii) indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings.  In addition, the Company paid its sixth annual installment of the Transition Tax, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in the second quarter of 2023, and will pay the balance of the Transition Tax, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments over the remainder of the eight-year period ending 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $1,350 related to certain geographies, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States.  It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated.\n​\n36\nCash Flow Summary\n​\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow:\n​\nNote:\nNet cash change from discontinued operations in the table above, during the year ended December 31, 2021, includes the proceeds from the sale of the Divested MTS business, as defined and discussed in further detail in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nOperating Activities\n​\nThe ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths.  Operating Cash Flow was $2,528.7 in 2023, compared to $2,174.6 in 2022 and $1,523.9 in 2021. The increase in Operating Cash Flow in 2023 compared to 2022 is primarily due to an overall decrease in the net components of working capital in 2023, as discussed in more detail below. The increase in Operating Cash Flow in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to both an increase in net income from continuing operations and a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital as discussed below.\n​\nIn 2023, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $149.8, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable of $146.4 and inventories of $71.4, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $34.6 and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $34.1.  In 2022, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $193.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in inventories of $278.5 and accounts receivable of $273.1, partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $246.3 and accounts payable of $62.5, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $49.7. In 2021, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $496.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $398.4, $263.0 and $20.2, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $131.7 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $53.5.\n​\nThe following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.  Accounts receivable decreased $12.9 to $2,618.4, driven by the decrease in days sales outstanding as noted below, which was largely offset by the impact of the 10 acquisitions (collectively, the “2023 Acquisitions”) that closed during 2023 and the effect of translation from exchange rate changes (“Translation”) at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.  Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 70 days and 73 days, respectively.  Inventories increased $73.5 to $2,167.1, which was primarily driven by the impact of the 2023 Acquisitions.  Inventory days at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 85 days and 86 days, respectively.  Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $69.6 to $389.6, primarily due to increases in various prepaid expenses and other current receivables, along with the impact of the 2023 Acquisitions.  Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $110.4 to $1,314.7, primarily due to capital expenditures of $372.8, the impact of the 2023 Acquisitions and Translation, partially offset by depreciation of $313.7 and disposals.  Goodwill increased $646.3 to $7,092.4, primarily driven by goodwill recognized as a result of the 2023 Acquisitions, along with Translation.  Other intangible assets, net, increased $100.7 to $834.8, primarily due to the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the 2023 Acquisitions, partially offset by amortization of $86.0 associated with the Company’s current intangible assets.  Accounts payable increased $41.8 to $1,350.9, primarily due to the impact of the 2023 Acquisitions.  Payable days at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 55 days and 54 days, respectively.  Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $83.7 to $1,448.0, primarily due to the impact of the 2023 Acquisitions and increases in certain other accrued expenses, partially offset by modest decreases in accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits and accrued income taxes.  Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations increased $15.1 to $143.0.\n37\n​\nIn addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash.  The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.  The increases in Free Cash Flow in 2023 compared to 2022, as well as in 2022 compared to 2021, were driven by the increase in Operating Cash Flow in each respective year, as described above.  The following table is on a continuing operations basis only and excludes any cash flows related to discontinued operations:\n​\n​\nInvesting Activities\n​\nCash flows from investing activities primarily consist of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment\n, net purchases (sales and maturities) of short- and long-term investments, and acquisitions.\n​\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $1,393.7 in 2023, compared to $731.1 in 2022 and $2,604.4 in 2021.  In 2023, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by the use of $970.4 to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $368.8, and net purchases of short-term investments of $59.4.  In 2022, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $378.2, the use of $288.2 to fund acquisitions, net purchases of long-term investments of $56.0, and net purchases of short-term investments of $25.2. In 2021, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by the use of $2,225.4 to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $356.7, and net purchases of short-term investments of $8.6.\n​\nFinancing Activities\n​\nCash flows from financing activities primarily consist of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of Common Stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests.\n​\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $1,012.4 in 2023, compared to $1,196.7 in 2022 and $145.1 in 2021. In 2023, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by (i) net repayments of $632.6 related to the Company’s commercial paper programs, primarily the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, (ii) repurchases of the Company’s Common Stock of $585.1, (iii) dividend payments of $500.6, (iv)\ndistributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $24.0, (v) other debt repayments of $15.7, (vi) payments of $2.3 related to debt financing costs associated with the Company’s $350.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.750% Senior Notes due March 30, 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”), and (vii) payment of $1.5 associated with the deferred purchase price related to an acquisition, partially offset by (a) cash proceeds of $394.5 from the exercise of stock options and (b) net cash proceeds from borrowings of $354.9, primarily related to the issuance of the 2026 Senior Notes.  In 2022, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by (i) repurchases of the Company’s Common Stock of $730.5, (ii) dividend payments of $477.4, (iii) net repayments of $159.3, primarily under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, (iv) other debt repayments of $55.2, primarily related to short-term debt, and (v)\ndistributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $9.9, partially offset by (a) cash proceeds of $185.3 from the exercise of stock options and (b) proceeds of $50.7 primarily related to short-term borrowings.  In 2021, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by (i) debt repayments of $912.6, primarily related to the repayment of the assumed then-outstanding MTS senior notes in the second quarter of 2021 as well as the redemption of the 3.125% Senior Notes (the “2021 Senior Notes”) in the third quarter of 2021 and the redemption of the 4.00% Senior Notes (the “2022 Senior Notes”) in the fourth quarter of 2021, (ii) repurchases of the Company’s Common Stock of $661.7, (iii) dividend payments of $346.7, (iv) a cash transfer of $28.7 made by the Company’s continuing operations to its discontinued operations in order to fund the September 2021 payment of contingent consideration assumed as part of the MTS acquisition, (v) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $18.9,\n38\n(vi) payments of $9.3 related to debt financing costs associated with the Company’s $750.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.200% Senior Notes due September 15, 2031 (the “2031 Senior Notes”), and (vii) payments of $4.1 associated with the deferred purchase price related to acquisitions, partially offset by (a) net borrowings of $796.3 primarily under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the majority of the proceeds of which were used to fund acquisitions, including MTS, and to redeem the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2022 Senior Notes, (b) net cash proceeds of $752.1, primarily related to the September 2021 issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes, and (c) cash proceeds of $288.5 from the exercise of stock options.\n​\nThe Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments.  The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity.  The Company’s debt financing includes the use of Commercial Paper Programs, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan, and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.\n​\nThe Company has an amended and restated $2,500.0 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).  The Revolving Credit Facility matures in November 2026 and gives the Company the ability to borrow, in various currencies, at a spread that varies, based on the Company’s debt rating, over certain currency-specific benchmark rates, which benchmark rates in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings are either the base rate or the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).  The Company may utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants.  On December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n​\nOn April 19, 2022, the Company entered into a two-year, $750.0 unsecured delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the “Term Loan”), which is scheduled to mature on April 19, 2024.  The Term Loan was undrawn at closing and may be drawn on up to five occasions over the life of the facility.  The Term Loan may be repaid at any time without premium or penalty, and, once repaid, cannot be reborrowed.  If drawn upon, the proceeds from the Term Loan are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.  Interest rates under the Term Loan are based on a spread over either the base rate or the adjusted term SOFR, which spread varies based on the Company’s debt rating.  As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Company had not yet drawn upon the Term Loan, and as such,\nthere were no outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan.  The Term Loan requires payment of certain commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants, which financial covenants are the same as those under the Revolving Credit Facility.  On December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Term Loan.\n​\nThe Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “USCP Notes”) in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”).\nThe maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time is $2,500.0.  The Company utilizes borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program for general corporate purposes, which, in recent years, have included fully or partially funding acquisitions, as well as repaying certain outstanding senior notes as was the case in 2021 with (i) the third quarter 2021 redemption of the\n2021 Senior Notes, of which $227.7 aggregate principal amount was then outstanding, and (ii) the fourth quarter 2021 redemption of the 2022 Senior Notes, of which $295.0 aggregate principal amount was then outstanding\n.  The Company borrowed under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program throughout much of 2023, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes.  During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company repaid all of its USCP Notes then outstanding, and, as of December 31, 2023, there were no USCP Notes outstanding.  As of December 31, 2022,\nthe amount of USCP Notes outstanding was $632.8, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.69%.\n​\nThe Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) also have a commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”), pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States.  The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. dollars or other currencies.  The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time is $2,000.0.  The Company utilizes borrowings under the Euro Commercial Paper Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, for example, fully or partially funding acquisitions.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no ECP Notes outstanding.\n​\n39\nAmounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time.  In conjunction with the Revolving Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2023, the authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) limits the maximum principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper or similar programs, along with outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, at any time to $2,500.0 in the aggregate\n.\nThe Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and, based on the Board’s authorization described above, are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary.  Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.  The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of Commercial Paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows:\n​\n​\nOn March 30, 2023, the Company issued the 2026 Senior Notes.  The Company used the net proceeds from the 2026 Senior Notes to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.  On September 14, 2021, the Company issued the 2031 Senior Notes.  The Company used the net proceeds from the 2031 Senior Notes to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.\n​\nAll of the Company’s outstanding senior notes in the United States (the “\nU.S. Senior Notes”) are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s and the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness.  Interest on each series of U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually.\nThe Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.\n​\nThe Euro Issuer has two outstanding unsecured senior notes issued in Europe.  The Euro Issuer has €500.0 (approximately $545.4 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 0.750% Senior Notes due May 4, 2026 (the “2026 Euro Notes”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under the then existing revolving credit facility.  In addition, the Euro Issuer also has €500.0 (approximately $574.6 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 (the “2028 Euro Notes”, together with the 2026 Euro Notes, the “Euro Notes”, and the Euro Notes, together with the U.S. Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under our Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.  The Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s and the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company.  Interest on each series of Euro Notes is payable annually.  The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of either series of Euro Notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.\n​\nThe Senior Notes impose certain obligations on the Company and prohibit various actions by the Company unless it satisfies certain financial requirements.  On December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all requirements under its Senior Notes.  Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.\n​\nOn April 27, 2021, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 27, 2024 (the “2021 Stock Repurchase Program”).  During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased 7.2 million, 9.9 million and 6.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $585.1, $730.5 and $457.9, respectively, under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program.  Of the total repurchases made in 2023, 5.5 million shares, or $435.8, have been retired\n40\nby the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase.  Of the total repurchases made in 2022, 9.3 million shares, or $689.7, have been retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase.  Of the total repurchases made in 2021 under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, 5.8 million shares, or $424.9, were retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase.  From January 1, 2024 through January 31, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any additional shares of its Common Stock, and, as of February 1, 2024, the Company has remaining authorization to purchase up to $226.5 of its Common Stock under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program.  The timing and amount of any future purchases will depend on a number of factors, such as the levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock options exercised by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends paid, economic and market conditions and the price of the Common Stock.\n​\nIn April 2018, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $2,000.0 of Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”).  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $203.8 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.  As a result of these purchases, the Company completed all purchases authorized under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, and, therefore, the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program was terminated.  Of the total repurchases made in 2021 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, 2.8 million shares, or $184.0, were retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase.\n​\nContingent upon declaration by the Board, the Company pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock.\nOn October 25, 2022, the Board approved an increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend rate from $0.20 per share to $0.21 per share, effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2022, and on October 24, 2023, the Board approved an additional increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend rate from $0.21 per share to $0.22 per share, effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2023, contingent upon declaration by the Board.  The following table summ\narizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n​\n​\nThe following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n​\n​\nPensions\n​\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company.  The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory.  The majority of U.S. employees are not covered by the U.S. Plans and are instead covered by various defined contribution plans.  Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “Foreign Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”).  The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations associated with the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans decreased in 2023 to $106.0 from $111.1 in 2022, primarily driven by actual positive returns on plan assets in 2023, partially offset by interest cost and the modest effect of the lower discount rates in 2023 on our projected benefit obligations.  There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future, if any.\n​\nRefer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans.\n41\nAcquisitions\n​\nDuring 2023, the Company completed 10 acquisitions (the “2023 Acquisitions”) for $970.4, net of cash acquired.  Five of the acquisitions have been included in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment, three acquisitions have been included in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, and two acquisitions have been included in the Communications Solutions segment.  The 2023 Acquisitions were each funded using cash on hand or borrowings under our Commercial Paper Programs, or a combination thereof.  One of the 2023 Acquisitions, which closed in the second quarter of 2023, represented a bargain purchase, where the estimated fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, exceeded the purchase price.  The Company recognized a non-cash gain of $5.4 on the bargain purchase acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2023, which has been recorded separately in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.  The 2023 Acquisitions were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s financial results.\n​\nDuring 2022, the Company completed two acquisitions (the “2022 Acquisitions”) for $288.2, net of cash acquired.  One of the 2022 Acquisitions was included in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment, and the other acquisition was included in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment.  The 2022 Acquisitions, which were funded through a combination of borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and cash on hand, were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s financial results.\n​\nAcquisition-related Expenses\n​\nIn 2023, the Company incurred $34.6 ($30.2 after-tax) of acquisition-related expenses, comprised primarily of external transaction costs associated with the 2023 Acquisitions, along with the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from three of the 2023 Acquisitions.  In 2022, the Company incurred $21.5 ($18.4 after-tax) of acquisition-related expenses, comprised primarily of the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from the 2022 Acquisitions, along with external transaction costs.\nSuch acquisition-related expenses are presented separately in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\n​\nFor further discussion of the Company’s acquisitions, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nSubsequent Events\n​\nOn January 30, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement by and between the Company and Carlisle Companies Incorporated (“Carlisle”), agreeing to acquire the Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (“CIT”) business of Carlisle for an aggregate purchase price of $2,025 in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.  The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2024 and is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  The Company expects to finance the CIT acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing, which could include borrowings under the Company’s existing credit and/or U.S. Commercial Paper Program.  CIT, headquartered in St. Augustine, FL, is a leading global supplier of harsh environment interconnect solutions primarily to the commercial aerospace, defense and industrial end markets.  CIT’s wide range of products include wire and cable, cable assemblies, contacts, connectors and sensors, which, management believes, are highly complementary to Amphenol’s existing interconnect and sensor solutions.  If and when the acquisition is consummated, the Company expects to report the CIT business within its Harsh Environment Solutions segment.\n​\nEnvironmental Matters\n​\nCertain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.  The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  For more information on certain environmental matters, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\n42\nInflation and Costs\n​\nThe cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials.  The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs.  However, in certain markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful.  From time to time, the Company may encounter difficulties in obtaining certain raw materials or components necessary for production due to supply chain constraints and logistical challenges, which may include regulatory restrictions.  These difficulties may also negatively impact the pricing of materials and components sourced or used by the Company.  While the Company does not currently anticipate significant, broad-based difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production, inflationary pressures and logistical challenges may impact the cost and availability of certain raw materials and components used by the Company and result in supply shortages for discrete raw materials or components, which could be further exacerbated by increased commodity prices and additional inflation.  For a discussion of certain risks related to inflation and costs, refer to the risk factor titled “\nThe Company and certain of its suppliers and customers have experienced difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of certain of the Company’s raw materials and components is increasing\n” in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nherein.\n​\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\n​\nThe Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result, is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies, including possible currency devaluations.  Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity.  The Company attempts to mitigate currency risk in a number of ways, such as locating factories in the same country or region in which products are sold, hedging contracts, cost reduction and pricing actions or working capital management.  However, there can be no assurance that any or all such actions taken by the Company will be fully effective in successfully managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations.  For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled “\nThe Company’s results can be positively or negatively affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates\n” in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nherein.\n​\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n​\nIn addition to assessing the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures, defined below, as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Board and assessing related employee compensation measures.  Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below.  Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS from continuing operations exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented.  Items excluded in the presentation of such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, gains associated with bargain purchase acquisitions, and certain discrete tax items including, but not limited to, (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the impact of significant changes in tax law.  Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions.\nNon-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures presented within this Item 7 are on a continuing operations basis only and exclude any results associated with discontinued operations.  The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures.  In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items.\n​\nThe non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the\n43\nmost directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are included in “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Item 7:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n​\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including those adopted by the Company.\n​\n​\n44\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n​\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Management bases its estimates on historical experience along with other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in formulating our bases for making judgements regarding the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent elsewhere.  Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The Company believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical since they require significant assumptions and judgments that inherently are subject to risks and uncertainties.  The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nRevenue Recognition\n​\nThe\nCompany’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers (including original equipment manufacturers) or to distributors.  Our revenues are derived from contracts with customers, which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements.  For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation. As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer’s credit risk.  Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery.  Although products are almost always sold at fixed prices, in determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund (due to returns) or adjustment (due to volume discounts, rebates, or price concessions) to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer, including but not limited to sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, are not included in the transaction price.\n​\nThe vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customers, when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods, and where the Company has a present right to payment for such goods.  Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point or (ii) when the product arrives at its destination.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, less than 5% of our net sales were recognized over time, where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination. For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs.  This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control.  Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, contract assets and contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n​\nStandard product warranty coverage, which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment, is typically offered, while extended or separately priced warranty coverage is typically not offered. The warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge.  We estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience, product history, and current trends.\n​\nIncome Taxes\n​\nDeferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes.  The Company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted.  Deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the Company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $1,350 related to certain geographies, as it is the\n45\nCompany’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States.  It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated.  In addition, the Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries.  It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences.  Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered.\n​\nThe tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.\n​\nAs a result of the Tax Act, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision imposed a tax on certain earnings o\nf foreign subsidiaries.  The Company elected an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost.  The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the Tax Act and proposed additional guidance related to the same provisions.  The Company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released, if appropriate.\n​"

The 0.750% Euro Senior Notes, which were issued in May 2020, mature on May 4, 2026, while the 2.000% Euro Senior Notes, which were issued in October 2018, mature on October 8, 2028.  The Company and the Euro Issuer also have\na commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”), pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue, outside of the United States, short-term unsecured commercial paper notes.\nWhile the Euro Notes are denominated in Euros, the Company may borrow, from time to time, under the Revolving Credit Facility and Euro Commercial Paper Program, and such borrowings have been and may continue to be denominated in various foreign currencies, including the Euro.  When borrowing in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully manage changes in exchange rates, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies in which such borrowings are made.  Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of debt.\n​\nThe Company also utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for exposures associated with (i) certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies and (ii) net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries from which we expect to repatriate earnings to the United States.  As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of such foreign exchange forward contracts\nwas not material.  A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022.  The Company does\n46\nnot engage in purchasing forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes, and our derivative financial instruments are with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company does not have any significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty.  Refer to Note 1 and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments.\n​\nInterest Rate Risk\n​\nThe Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities.  The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.  The Company currently has various fixed rate senior notes outstanding, in both the United States and Europe, with various maturity dates, the most recent of which was issued in 2023.  In March 2023, the Company issued $350.0 principal amount of 4.750% 2026 Senior Notes, the net proceeds of which were used to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.\n​\nAny borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at rates that fluctuate with a spread that varies, based on the Company’s debt rating, over certain currency-specific benchmark rates, which benchmark rates in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings are either the base rate or the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).  Similarly, any borrowings under the two-year, $750.0 delayed draw Term Loan entered into by the Company in April of 2022, bear interest at rates that fluctuate with a spread that varies, based on the Company’s debt rating, over either the base rate or the adjusted term SOFR.  Any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates.  Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Pro\ngram.  However\n, the Company borrowed under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program throughout much of 2023, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes, and the Company may make additional borrowings under any of its debt instruments from time to time.  As of December 31, 2023\n, less than 1% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan and Euro Commercial Paper Program, while approximately $640, or 14% of the Company’s outstan\nding borrowings in 2022, primarily under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, were subject to floating interest rates.  The Company’s weighted average floating rate on borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2022 was 4.69%.\n​\nAs a result of increases in the federal funds rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve beginning in early 2022 and through the middle of 2023, the floating interest rates related to our U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as well as our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, to the extent either are drawn upon in the future) have increased substantially over this same period, a trend that could continue into 2024 and potentially beyond.  To the extent that interest rates related to this floating rate debt increase further and the Company borrows under any of these floating interest rate instruments in the future, interest expense and interest payments would increase.  A 10% change in the interest rate at December\n31, 2023 and 2022 under our Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan or Commercial Paper Programs would not have a material effect on interest expense.  Although the Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2024, there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly from current levels.\n​\n47"

    "text": "​\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n​\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Amphenol Corporation\n​\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n​\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flow, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n​\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles). Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\n​\nBasis for Opinions\n​\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n​\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n​\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n​\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n​\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n​\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n​\n48\nCritical Audit Matter\n​\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n​\nIncome Taxes — Unrecognized Tax Benefits — Refer to Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements\n​\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n​\nThe Company operates in the U.S. and numerous foreign taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by tax authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\n​\nManagement judgment is required to identify and evaluate each uncertain tax position to determine whether the more likely than not recognition thresholds have been met. Further, the evaluation of each uncertain tax position requires management to apply specialized skill and knowledge related to the identified position. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $216.0 million, including penalties and interest, as of December 31, 2023.\n​\nWe identified the liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a critical audit matter because of the complexity created by the multiple jurisdictions in which the Company files its tax returns, each of which has differing and complex tax laws and regulations. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate management’s identification of uncertain tax positions, the estimates of the amounts to be realized and whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained.\n​\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n​\nOur audit procedures related to uncertain tax positions included the following, among others:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n​\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 7, 2024\n​\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.\n49\nAMPHENOL CORPORATION\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(dollars and shares in millions, except per share data)\n​\n​\nNote:  Per share amounts may not add due to rounding.\n​\n​\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n​\n50\nAMPHENOL CORPORATION\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n(dollars in millions)\n​\n​\n​\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n​\n​\n​\n51\n​\nAMPHENOL CORPORATION\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(dollars and shares in millions, except per share data)\n​\n​\n​\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n​\n​\n52\nAMPHENOL CORPORATION\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\n(dollars and shares in millions, except per share data)\n​\n​\n​\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n​\n53\nAMPHENOL CORPORATION\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flow\n(dollars in millions)\n​\n​\n​\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n​\n54\nAMPHENOL CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n​\n(All amounts included in the following Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)\n​\n​\nNote 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n​\nBusiness\n​\nAmphenol Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Amphenol,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors and interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable.  The Company sells its products to customers worldwide.\n​\nThe Company aligns its businesses into the following\nthree\nreportable business segments:\n​\n●\nHarsh Environment Solutions\n– the Harsh Environment Solutions segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of ruggedized interconnect products, including connectors and interconnect systems, printed circuits and printed circuit assemblies and other products for use in the industrial, defense, commercial aerospace, automotive, mobile networks and information technology and data communications end markets.\n​\n●\nCommunications Solutions\n– the Communications Solutions segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of connector and interconnect systems, including high speed, radio frequency, power, fiber optic and other products, together with antennas, for use in the information technology and data communications, mobile devices, industrial, mobile networks, broadband communications, automotive, commercial aerospace and defense end markets.\n​\n●\nInterconnect and Sensor Systems\n– the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of sensors, sensor-based systems, connectors and value-add interconnect systems used in the automotive, industrial, information technology and data communications, mobile networks, defense and commercial aerospace end markets.\n​\nThe Company began reporting under these reportable segments in connection with its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2022 and for each quarterly and annual period thereafter.\nAll segment information throughout the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is presented in accordance with the\nthree\nreportable business segments.  Refer to Note 13 herein for further details related to the Company’s reportable business segments.\n​\nUse of Estimates\n​\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The Company’s management evaluates these significant estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  Estimates used in calculating certain accounts, including but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, provisions for slow-moving or obsolete inventory, revenue recognition, income taxes and related valuation allowances, goodwill and intangible assets from acquisitions, and pensions, are developed based on historical experience or other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n​\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n​\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The results of companies acquired are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the\n55\neffective date of acquisition.  Similarly, the results of companies divested are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements during the period of Amphenol’s ownership through the date of the divestiture.\n​\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n​\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amounts approximate fair values of those instruments, the majority of which are in non-U.S. bank accounts.\n​\nShort-term and Long-term Investments\n​\nShort-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit with original or remaining maturities of twelve months or less.  Long-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit with original and remaining maturities of more than twelve months.  The carrying amounts of these short-term and long-term investments approximate their respective fair values, the vast majority of which are in non-U.S. bank accounts.  Short-term investments are presented separately as its own line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Long-term investments are recorded in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\nAccounts Receivable\n​\nAccounts receivable is stated at net realizable value.  The Company regularly reviews accounts receivable balances and adjusts the receivable reserves as necessary whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  The Company assesses and records an allowance for expected credit losses on accounts receivable.\n​\nInventories\n​\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The principal components of cost included in inventories are materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand, evaluates the realizability of inventories and adjusts the carrying value as necessary based on forecasted product demand.\nProvisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand.\n​\nDepreciable Assets\n​\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the respective asset lives determined on a composite basis by asset group or on a specific item basis using the estimated useful lives of such assets, which generally range from\n3\nto\n12 years\nfor machinery and equipment and office equipment and\n20\nto\n40 years\nfor buildings.  Leasehold building improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated useful life of such improvements.  The Company periodically reviews fixed asset lives.  Depreciation expense is included in both Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, dependent upon the specific categorization and use of the underlying asset being depreciated.  The Company assesses the impairment of property, plant and equipment subject to depreciation, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of the use of the asset, significant changes in historical trends in operating performance, significant changes in projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends.  There have been\nno\nimpairments recorded in 2023, 2022 or 2021 as a result of such reviews.\n​\nLeases\n​\nAmphenol is a lessee of buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment throughout the world, nearly all of which are classified as operating leases expiring at various dates.  The Company determines if an arrangement qualifies as a lease at lease inception.  Lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for existing operating leases are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Operating lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term, assessed as of the commencement date.  The Company’s real estate leases, which are comprised primarily of manufacturing facilities, warehouses and sales offices, represent the vast majority of our operating lease liabilities and generally have a lease term between\n2\nand\n12 years\n.  The remaining leases primarily consist of machinery and equipment used in production, office equipment and vehicles, each with various lease terms.  The vast majority of our leases are comprised of fixed lease payments, with a small percentage of the Company’s real\n56\nestate leases including lease payments tied to a rate or index which may be subject to variability.  Certain real estate leases also include executory costs such as common area maintenance (non-lease component), as well as property insurance and property taxes (non-components).\nWe account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for our real estate leases.\nLease payments, which may include lease components, non-lease components and non-components, are included in the measurement of the Company’s lease liabilities to the extent that such payments are either fixed amounts or variable amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance) as stipulated in the lease contract.  Any actual costs in excess of such amounts are expensed as incurred as variable lease cost.\n​\nSubstantially all of our lease agreements do not specify an implicit borrowing rate, and as such, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate by lease term, in order to calculate the present value of our future lease payments.  The discount rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a secured basis, and is the rate at which the Company would borrow funds to satisfy the scheduled lease liability payment streams commensurate with the lease term.  For new or renewed leases, the discount rate is determined using available data at lease commencement and based on the lease term including any reasonably certain renewal periods.\n​\nSome of our lease agreements, primarily related to real estate, include options for the Company to either renew (extend) or early terminate the lease.  Leases with renewal options allow the Company to extend the lease term typically between\n1\nand\n6 years\n.  Renewal options are reviewed at lease commencement to determine if such options are reasonably certain of being exercised, which could impact the lease term.  When determining if a renewal option is reasonably certain of being exercised, the Company considers several factors, including but not limited to, the significance of leasehold improvements incurred on the property, whether the asset is difficult to replace, or specific characteristics unique to the particular lease that would make it reasonably certain that we would exercise such option.  In most cases and unless there is an economic, financial or business reason to do so, the Company has concluded that renewal and early termination options are not reasonably certain of being exercised by the Company (and thus not included in our ROU asset and lease liability).\n​\nRefer to Note 10 herein for further information related to our lease portfolio.\n​\nGoodwill\n​\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations.  As a result of the change in the reporting segment structure that went in effect on January 1, 2022, the Company utilized the relative fair value allocation approach to reallocate the historical goodwill associated with the previous Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment, while the historical goodwill associated with the previous Cable Products and Solutions segment was allocated in full to the Communications Solutions segment.  The Company concluded that there were no events or changes in circumstances, immediately prior to the reporting unit change, that would indicate that either of the Company’s legacy reporting unit’s carrying amount may be impaired.  Therefore, no goodwill impairment assessment was deemed necessary related to the legacy reporting units prior to the change.\n​\nThe Company continues to perform its evaluation for the impairment of goodwill associated with the Company’s reporting units on an annual basis as of each July 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount may be impaired.  The Company reviews its reporting unit structure each year, or more frequently based on changes in our organization.  The Company continues to define its reporting\nunits as the\nthree\nreportable business segments.  Prior to the segment structure change and through December 31, 2021, the Company then defined its reporting\nunits\nas the\ntwo\nreportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products and Solutions”.\n​\nIn 2023 and 2022, the annual goodwill impairment assessment was performed on the Company’s\nthree\nreporting units, while in 2021, the Company performed its annual assessment on the historic\ntwo\nreporting units that were then in effect.  In the third quarter of 2023 and 2022, as part of its annual evaluations, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment.  As part of these assessments, the Company reviews qualitative factors, which include, but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, as well as the financial performance of each reporting unit.  In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units is greater than its respective carrying amount.  As of July 1, 2023 and 2022, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount and, therefore, a\n57\nquantitative assessment was not required.  As a result,\nno\ngoodwill impairment resulted from the assessments as of July 1, 2023 and 2022.\n​\nThe Company has\nno\nt recognized any goodwill impairment in 2023, 2022 or 2021 in connection with its annual impairment assessments.  Refer to Note 12 herein for further details related to the carrying amount of goodwill by segment.\n​\nIntangible Assets\n​\nOther than goodwill, intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, proprietary technology, acquired backlog and license agreements and are generally amortized over the estimated periods of benefit.  The fair value associated with acquired identifiable intangible assets are generally valued based on discounted cash flow analyses, independent appraisals and certain estimates made by management.  The Company assesses and reviews its identifiable intangible assets, subject to amortization, for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the intangible asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Factors the Company considers important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of the use of the asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, significant changes in projected operating performance, anticipated future cash flows and significant negative economic trends.  Any indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, which are comprised of certain trade names, are reviewed at least annually for impairment.  In the third quarter of 2023, the Company performed its annual assessment of these identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nBased on its assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying amounts.  There has been\nno\nimpairment associated with the Company’s intangible assets in 2023, 2022 or 2021 as a result of such reviews.\n​\nAcquisitions\n​\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.  The purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed based on estimated fair values, and any excess purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.  Any subsequent adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the completion of the measurement period will be reflected as an adjustment to goodwill in the period in which the adjustments are identified.  The Company may use independent valuation specialists to assist in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could require certain significant management assumptions and estimates.\n​\nDiscontinued Operations and Held for Sale Accounting\n​\nThe Company reports a component of an entity or group of components of an entity as a discontinued operation and held for sale upon acquisition, if the Company has (i) executed a plan to sell the business as of the acquisition date or (ii)\nhas begun to formulate a plan to sell the business and either currently meets or expects to meet the held for sale criteria within three months.  An entity meets the held for sale criteria when (a) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the discontinued operation, the plan of which is unlikely to have any significant changes or to be withdrawn, (b) the completed sale is probable within one year, and (c) an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated with the operation actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and for immediate sale in its present condition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed from an entity that qualifies for held for sale accounting are measured and recorded at fair value less costs to sell, and are recorded as current assets held for sale and current liabilities held for sale when the planned sale is expected to close within one year. The Company separately accounts for the operating results and related cash flows associated with discontinued operations until such operations are divested; such discontinued operations are reported separately from the operating results and related cash flows associated with continuing operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor further information related to the Company’s discontinued operations, refer to Note 11 herein.\n​\nRevenue Recognition\n​\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.  The vast majority of our sales are recognized when products are shipped from our facilities or delivered to our customers, depending on the respective contractual terms.  A nominal portion of our contracts have revenue recognized over time as\n58\ncontrol of the goods transfers, rather than when the goods are delivered, and title, risk and reward of ownership are passed to the customer, since they have no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, from the customer for performance completed to date.  Refer to Note 13 herein for further discussion regarding the Company’s disaggregation of net sales.\n​\nThe Company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers (including original equipment manufacturers) or to distributors, and the vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer.  Revenues are derived from contracts with customers, which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements.  For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation. As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer’s credit risk.  Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net\n30\nto\n120 days\nafter delivery. Although products are almost always sold at fixed prices, in determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund (due to returns) or adjustment (due to volume discounts, rebates, or price concessions) to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer, including but not limited to sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, are not included in the transaction price.\n​\nThe vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer.\nWith limited exceptions, the Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customer, when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods, and where the Company has a present right to payment for such goods.  Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point or (ii) when the product arrives at its destination.  For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, less than\n5\n%\nof our net sales were recognized over time, where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination. For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs.  This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods, which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control.  Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, contract assets and contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n​\nThe Company receives customer orders negotiated with multiple delivery dates that may extend across more than\none\nreporting period until the contract is fulfilled, the end of the order period is reached, or a pre-determined maximum order value has been reached.  Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions.  It is generally expected that a substantial portion of our remaining performance obligations will be fulfilled within\nthree months\n.  Nearly all of our performance obligations are fulfilled within\none year\n.  Since our performance obligations are part of contracts that generally have original durations of\none\nyear or less, we have not disclosed the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n​\nSales to Distributors and Resellers\n​\nSales to certain distributors and resellers are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments and limited rights of return of the Company’s products held in their inventory or upon sale to their end customers.  The Company maintains a reserve for unprocessed and estimated future price adjustment claims and returns as a refund liability. The reserve is recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period that the related revenue is recorded and is calculated based on an analysis of historical claims and returns over a period of time to appropriately account for current pricing and business trends. Similarly, sales returns and allowances are recorded based on historical return rates, as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned.  These reserves were not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n​\n59\nWarranty\n​\nStandard product warranty coverage, which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment, is typically offered, while extended or separately priced warranty coverage is typically not offered. The warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge. We estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience, product history, and current trends, and record warranty expense in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Warranty liabilities and related warranty expense have not been and were not material in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n​\nShipping and Handling Costs\n​\nThe Company accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as a cost to fulfill our promise to transfer control of the related product, including any such costs incurred after the customer has obtained control of the goods.  Shipping and handling costs are generally charged to and paid by the majority of our customers as part of the contract.  For a nominal portion of our customer contracts, primarily for certain customers in the broadband communications market (a market primarily in the Communications Solutions segment), such costs are not separately charged to the customers.  Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\n​\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities\n​\nThe Company records contract assets or contract liabilities depending on the timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections on a contract-by-contract basis.  Contract assets represent unbilled receivables, which generally arise when revenue recognized over time exceed amounts billed to customers.  Contract liabilities represent billings or advanced consideration received from customers in excess of revenue recognized to date.  As the Company’s performance obligations are typically less than\none year\n, these amounts are generally recorded as current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets within Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other accrued expenses as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.  Contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n​\nContract Costs\n​\nThe Company’s policy is to capitalize any incremental costs incurred to obtain a customer contract, only to the extent that such costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer and the benefit associated with the costs is expected to be longer than\none\nyear.  Otherwise, such costs are expensed as incurred and recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  Incremental costs to fulfill customer orders, which are mostly comprised of pre-production and set-up costs, are generally capitalized to the extent such costs are contractually guaranteed to be reimbursed by the customer.  Otherwise, such costs are expensed as incurred.  Capitalized contract costs to obtain a contract or to fulfill a contract that are not accounted for under other existing accounting standards are recorded as either other current or long-term assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense, and are generally amortized consistent with the timing of when transfer of control of the related goods occurs.  Such capitalized contract costs were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related amortization expense was not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n​\nRetirement Pension Plans\n​\nCosts for retirement pension plans include current service costs and amortization of prior service costs over the average working life expectancy.  It is the Company’s policy to fund current pension costs taking into consideration minimum funding requirements and maximum tax deductible limitations. The expense of retiree medical benefit programs is recognized during the employees’ service with the Company.  The recognition of expense and the related obligation for retirement pension plans and medical benefit programs is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions made by management such as discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on assets, mortality projections and future health care costs.  The Company uses third-party specialists such as actuaries and investment advisors to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense and obligations associated with pension and other postretirement plan benefits.\n​\n60\nStock-Based Compensation\n​\nThe Company accounts for its stock option, restricted share and phantom stock awards based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense over the service period that the awards are expected to vest.  The Company recognizes expense for stock-based compensation with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire award.  Stock-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, which are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates.\nChanges in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods.  The expense incurred for stock-based compensation plans is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income\n.\n​\nIncome Taxes\n​\nDeferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes.  The Company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted.  Deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the Company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $\n1,350\nrelated to certain geographies, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States.  It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated.  In addition, the Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries.  It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences.  Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered.\n​\nThe tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.\n​\nAs a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision imposed a tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  The Company\nelected\nan accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost.  The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the Tax Act and proposed additional guidance related to the same provisions.  The Company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released, if appropriate.\n​\nForeign Currency Translation\n​\nThe financial position and results of operations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and related revenues and expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange rates. The aggregate effect of translation adjustments is included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity.  Transaction gains and losses related to operating assets and liabilities are included in Cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\n​\nResearch and Development\n​\nCosts incurred in connection with the development of new products and applications are expensed as incurred.  Research and development expenses for the creation of new and improved products and processes were\n$\n342.2\n, $\n323.6\n, and $\n317.7\n, for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\n​\n61\nEnvironmental Obligations\n​\nThe Company recognizes the potential cost for environmental remediation activities when site assessments are made, remediation efforts are probable and related amounts can be reasonably estimated.  The Company assesses its environmental liabilities as necessary and appropriate through regular reviews of contractual commitments, site assessments, feasibility studies and formal remedial design and action plans.\n​\nNet Income per Common Share\n​\nBasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares, including dilutive common shares, the dilutive effect of which relates to stock options.  Diluted earnings per common share assumes the exercise of outstanding dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method.  Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, used in the calculation of earnings per share (basic and diluted) from continuing operations, discontinued operations and for total Amphenol Corporation.\n​\nTreasury Stock\n​\nTreasury stock purchases are recorded at cost.  Any issuances from treasury shares are recorded using the weighted average cost method.\n​\nNoncontrolling Interests\n​\nThe Company presents noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as its own caption within equity, separate from the Company’s equity attributable to Amphenol Corporation stockholders\n, to the extent that such noncontrolling interests do not have redemption features that are not solely within the control of the Company, as discussed below.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests is classified below net income from continuing operations.  Earnings per share is determined after the impact of the noncontrolling interests’ share in net income of the Company.\n​\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n​\nThe Company reports noncontrolling interests in the mezzanine (“temporary equity”) section, between liabilities and equity, of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, to the extent that such noncontrolling interests have redemption features, such as a put option, that is redeemable at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date at the option of the holder, or upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the Company.  Due to its redeemable features that are outside the control of the Company, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is and will continue to be reported in the mezzanine section in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put option is exercisable by the option holder.  The carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest, initially valued at fair value as part of acquisition accounting, is adjusted each reporting period to equal the greater of the (i) redemption value or (ii) carrying value of the noncontrolling interest, adjusted each reporting period for income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest and any distributions made to date.  The redemption value is generally calculated based on a multiple of earnings.  Any measurement adjustments, if applicable, to the redeemable noncontrolling interest are recognized in Additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Refer to Note 5 herein for further details related to the redeemable noncontrolling interests.\n​\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n​\nThe Company records each of its derivatives at fair value within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the respective accounting treatment for each derivative is based on its hedge designation.  We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes\n, and our derivative financial instruments are with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company does not have any significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty.\nRefer to Note 5 herein for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments.\n​\n62\nCash Flow Hedges\n​\nFrom time to time, the Company utilizes derivative financial instruments in the management of interest rate and foreign currency exposures.  Such cash flow hedges include foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\nno\noutstanding cash flow hedge contracts.  Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges resulting from changes in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and subsequently reflected in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income in a manner that matches the timing of the actual income or expense of such instruments with that of the hedged transaction.  Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of designated hedging instruments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Cash flows associated with cash flow hedges are classified and reported consistent with the cash flows associated with the underlying hedged item.\n​\nNet Investment Hedges\n​\nThe Company is exposed to variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of the net investments in our foreign subsidiaries and, by extension, the U.S. dollar equivalent of any foreign earnings repatriated to the U.S. due to potential changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  As a result, from time to time, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries from which we expect to repatriate earnings to the United States.  As of December 31, 2023, there were\nno\noutstanding net investment hedge contracts.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding net investment hedge contracts was\nnil\nand $\n75\n, respectively.  For such instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the hedging instrument’s gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings if the net investment in the hedged foreign operation is either sold or substantially liquidated.  Cash flows associated with net investment hedges are classified and reported within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.  Cash flows associated with our net investment hedges were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n​\nNon-Designated Derivatives\n​\nThe Company enters into certain derivative financial instruments, from time to time, that are not designated as hedging instruments.  The Company enters into such foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce and minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations arising from the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.  These non-designated derivative instruments are adjusted to fair value each period through earnings, within the financial statement line item to which the derivative instrument relates.  For each of the three years ended December 31, 2023, such non-designated derivative instruments, including their impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income, were not material to the Company.  Cash flows associated with non-designated hedges are classified and reported consistent with the cash flows associated with the underlying hedged item.\n​\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n​\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-08,\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n(“ASU 2021-08”), which amends ASC 805 by requiring acquiring entities to apply ASC 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination.  The intent of ASU 2021-08 is to address diversity in practice and improve comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts by providing (i) guidance on how to determine whether a contract liability is recognized by the acquirer in a business combination and (ii) specific guidance on how to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination.  ASU 2021-08 and its amendments were effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, and the amendments should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments.  The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 on January 1, 2023.  ASU 2021-08 did not have a material impact on our acquisitions during 2023, and its impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows going forward will be dependent upon the nature of any future business combinations.\n​\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04,\nLiabilities – Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n(“ASU 2022-04”), which amends ASC 405 by requiring\n63\nentities to provide more detailed disclosures regarding supplier finance programs used in connection with the purchase of goods and services.  The intent of ASU 2022-04 is to enhance transparency of these programs by requiring entities to disclose (i) the key terms of the program(s), including the payment terms and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees, (ii) the amount of obligations outstanding at the end of the reporting period and a description of where those obligations are presented on the balance sheet, and (iii) annual rollforward information of the activity of such obligations during the reporting period.  ASU 2022-04 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with the exception of the disclosure of rollforward information, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023.  Disclosure requirements under ASU 2022-04 must be applied retrospectively covering each period for which a balance sheet is presented, with the exception of the rollforward information which shall be applied prospectively.  The Company completed its evaluation of ASU 2022-04, which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n​\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n(“ASU 2023-07”), which amends ASC 280.  The intent of ASU 2023-07 is to improve the disclosures around a public entity’s reportable segments and address requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses, by requiring entities to disclose on an annual and interim basis: (i) significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss and (ii) an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition, which represents the difference between segment revenue less segment expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss.  Furthermore, entities will be required to: (i) provide all annual disclosures about a segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required under ASC 280 on an interim basis as well, (ii) clarify that an entity is not precluded from reporting additional measures of a segment’s profit or loss that are used by the CODM in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, and (iii) disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.  ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n​\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n(“ASU 2023-09”).  The intent of ASU 2023-09 is to improve the disclosures around a company’s rate reconciliation information and certain types of income taxes companies are required to pay.  Specifically, these new disclosure requirements will provide more transparency regarding income taxes companies pay in the United States and other countries, along with more disclosure around a company’s rate reconciliation, among other new disclosure requirements, such that users of financial statements can get better information about how the operations, related tax risks, tax planning and operational opportunities of companies affect their effective tax rates and future cash flow prospects.  ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance.  The amendments under ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, although retrospective application is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n​\n​\nNote 2—Inventories\n​\nThe components of Inventories are comprised of:\n​\n​\n​\n64\nNote 3—Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\n​\nThe components of Property, plant and equipment, net are summarized as follows:\n​\n​\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n313.7\n, $\n306.1\nand $\n302.9\n, respectively.\n​\nNote 4—Long-Term Debt\n​\nLong-term debt consists of the following:\n​\n​\nRevolving Credit Facility\n​\nThe Company has an amended and restated $\n2,500.0\nunsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).  The Revolving Credit Facility matures in November 2026 and gives the Company the ability to borrow, in various currencies, at a spread that varies, based on the Company’s debt rating, over certain currency-specific benchmark rates, which benchmark rates in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings are either the base rate or the adjusted term Secured\n65\nOvernight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).  The Company may utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  The carrying value of any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility would approximate their fair value, primarily due to their market interest rates, and would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 5).  Any outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are classified as long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants.\n​\nTerm Loan Credit Facility\n​\nOn April 19, 2022, the Company entered into a\ntwo-year\n, $\n750.0\nunsecured delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the “Term Loan”), which is scheduled to mature on\nApril 19, 2024\n.  The Term Loan was undrawn at closing and may be drawn on up to\nfive\noccasions over the life of the facility.  The Term Loan may be repaid at any time without premium or penalty, and, once repaid, cannot be reborrowed.  If drawn upon, the proceeds from the Term Loan are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.  Interest rates under the Term Loan are based on a spread over either the base rate or the adjusted term SOFR, which spread varies based on the Company’s debt rating.  The carrying value of any borrowings under the Term Loan would approximate their fair value, primarily due to its market interest rates, and would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 5).  As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not yet drawn upon the Term Loan, and as such, there were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Term Loan.  The Term Loan requires payment of certain commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants, which financial covenants are the same as those under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n​\nCommercial Paper Programs\n​\nThe Company has a commercial paper program (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”) pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “USCP Notes” or “U.S. Commercial Paper”) in one or more private placements in the United States.  The maturities of the USCP Notes vary but may not exceed\n397 days\nfrom the date of issue.  The USCP Notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom, and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.  The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time is\n$\n2,500.0\n.  The Company utilizes borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program for general corporate purposes, which, in recent years, have included fully or partially funding acquisitions as discussed in Note 11 herein, as well as repaying certain outstanding senior notes as was the case in 2021 with (i) the third quarter 2021 redemption of its unsecured\n3.125\n% Senior Notes (the “2021 Senior Notes”), of which $\n227.7\naggregate principal amount was then outstanding, and (ii) the fourth quarter 2021 redemption of its unsecured\n4.00\n% Senior Notes (the “2022 Senior Notes”), of which $\n295.0\naggregate principal amount was then outstanding.  As of December 31, 2022, the amount of USCP Notes outstanding was\n$\n632.8\n, with a weighted average interest rate of\n4.69\n%\n.  In the first quarter of 2023, the Company used net proceeds from the 2026 Senior Notes (as defined below) to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.  The Company borrowed under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program throughout much of 2023, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes.  During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company repaid all of its USCP Notes then outstanding, and, as of December 31, 2023, there were\nno\nUSCP Notes outstanding.\n​\nThe Company and\none\nof its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) also have a commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”), pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States.  The maturities of the ECP Notes will vary but may not exceed\n183 days\nfrom the date of issue.  The ECP Notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom or a premium thereto and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.\nThe ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. dollars or other currencies.  The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time is\n$\n2,000.0\n.  The Company utilizes borrowings under the Euro Commercial Paper Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, for example, fully or partially funding acquisitions.  In the first quarter of 2023, the Company used borrowings under its Euro Commercial Paper Program, along with cash on hand, to fund an acquisition.  These borrowings under the Euro Commercial Paper Program were repaid in their entirety by the end of the first quarter of 2023.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\nno\nECP Notes outstanding.\n​\n66\nAmounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time.  In conjunction with the Revolving Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2023, the authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) limits the maximum principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper or similar programs, along with outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, at any time to\n$\n2,500.0\nin the aggregate.  The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and, based on the Board’s authorization described above, are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary.  Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.\nAny outstanding Commercial Paper is classified as long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets since the Company has the intent and ability to refinance the Commercial Paper on a long-term basis using the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility.  The carrying value of Commercial Paper approximates its fair value, primarily due to its market interest rates, and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 5).\n​\nU.S. Senior Notes\n​\nOn March 30, 2023, the Company issued $\n350.0\nprincipal amount of unsecured\n4.750\n% Senior Notes due\nMarch 30, 2026\nat\n99.658\n%\nof face value (the “2026 Senior Notes”).  The 2026 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s and the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness.  Interest on the 2026 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on March 30 and September 30 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2023.  The Company may redeem, from time to time at its option, some or all of the 2026 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to\n100\n% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, plus a make-whole premium.  The Company used the net proceeds from the 2026 Senior Notes to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.\n​\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company issued $\n750.0\nprincipal amount of unsecured\n2.200\n% Senior Notes due\nSeptember 15, 2031\nat\n99.634\n% of face value (the “2031 Senior Notes”).  The 2031 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s and the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness.  Interest on the 2031 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2022.  Prior to June 15, 2031, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2031 Senior Notes at any time by paying the redemption price (which includes a make-whole premium), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption.  If redeemed on or after June 15, 2031, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2031 Senior Notes at any time by paying the redemption price equal to\n100\n% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2031 Senior Notes to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.\n​\nAll of the Company’s outstanding senior notes in the United States (the “U.S. Senior Notes”) are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s and the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness.  Interest on each series of U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually.  The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions, which include paying\n100\n% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium.\n​\nEuro Senior Notes\n​\nThe Euro Issuer has\ntwo\noutstanding unsecured senior notes issued in Europe.  The Euro Issuer has\n€\n500.0\n(approximately $\n545.4\nat date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured\n0.750\n% Senior Notes due\nMay 4, 2026\nat\n99.563\n% of face value (the “2026 Euro Notes” or the “\n0.750\n%\nEuro Senior Notes”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under the then existing revolving credit facility.  The Euro Issuer also has\n€\n500.0\n(approximately $\n574.6\nat date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured\n2.000\n% Senior Notes due\nOctober 8, 2028\nat\n99.498\n% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes” or the “\n2.000\n% Euro Senior Notes”,\ntogether with the 2026 Euro Notes, the “Euro Notes”, and the Euro Notes, together with the U.S. Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under our Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.  The Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s and the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company.  Interest on the 2026 Euro Notes and 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on May 4 and October 8 of each year, respectively.  The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of\neither\nseries of Euro Notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions, which include\n67\npaying\n100\n% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium.\n​\nThe fair value of each series of Senior Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 5).  The Senior Notes impose certain obligations on the Company and prohibit various actions by the Company unless it satisfies certain financial requirements.\n​\nThe maturity of the Company’s debt (exclusive of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2023) over each of the next five years ending December 31 and thereafter, is as follows:\n​\n​\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $\n55.4\nof uncommitted standby letter of credit facilities, of which $\n40.9\nwere issued.\n​\nNote 5—Fair Value Measurements\n​\nFair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. These requirements establish market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values. Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs. The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.\n​\nThe valuation techniques required are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\n​\nLevel 1         Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n​\nLevel 2         Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\n​\nLevel 3         Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\n​\nThe Company’s assets and liabilities currently subject to such standards with fair value disclosure requirements are primarily (i) debt instruments, (ii) pension plan assets, and (iii) assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed as part of acquisition accounting, which are discussed in Note 4, Note 9 and Note 11, respectively, herein, along with short- and long-term investments and derivative instruments, discussed below.  Substantially all of the Company’s short- and long-term investments consist of certificates of deposit, which are considered as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  The vast majority of the Company’s existing long-term investments have original maturities of\ntwo years\n.  The carrying amounts of these short- and long-term instruments, the vast majority of which are in non-U.S. bank accounts, approximate their respective fair values.  The Company’s derivative instruments primarily consist of foreign exchange forward contracts, which are valued using bank quotations based on market observable inputs such as forward and spot rates and are therefore classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  The impact of the credit risk related to these derivative financial assets is immaterial.\n​\n68\nThe Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis and determines the appropriate classification of such assets and liabilities subject to the fair value hierarchy standards based on, among other things, the ability to observe valuation inputs.  The fair values of the Company’s financial and non-financial assets and liabilities subject to such standards at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows:\n​\n​\nThe Company utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts, hedging instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, in the management of foreign currency exposures.  In addition, the Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, accounted for as net investment hedges, to hedge our exposure to variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of the net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company had\nno\noutstanding foreign exchange forward contracts accounted for as either net investment hedges or\ncash flow hedges\n.  As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of such foreign exchange forward contracts in the table above consisted of various outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments.  As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of such foreign exchange forward contracts in the table above consisted primarily of (i)\none\noutstanding foreign exchange forward contract accounted for as a net investment hedge and (ii) various outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company had\nno\noutstanding foreign exchange forward contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair values of the Company’s forward contracts are recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets, Other long-term assets, Other accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on their value and remaining contractual period.\n​\nCertain acquisitions may result in noncontrolling interest holders who, in certain cases, are entitled to a put option, giving them the ability to put some or all of their redeemable interest in the shares of the acquiree to the Company.  Specifically, if exercised by the noncontrolling interest holder, Amphenol would be required to purchase some or all of the option holder’s redeemable interest, at a redemption price during specified time period(s) stipulated in the respective acquisition agreement.  The redeemable noncontrolling interests recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets relate to recent acquisitions, which, based on the terms of the respective acquisition agreements, will remain in temporary equity until the applicable put option is either fully exercised or expires.  The redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is generally calculated using Level 3 unobservable inputs based on a multiple of earnings, which, for the redeemable noncontrolling interests currently outstanding, approximate fair value.  As such, the redemption value is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and is recorded as Redeemable noncontrolling interests on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.  A rollforward of the Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.\n​\nWith the exception of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisition accounting, the Company does not have any other significant financial or non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  For further discussion and related policies regarding the Company’s short- and long-term investments, derivative financial instruments, and redeemable noncontrolling interests, refer to Note 1 herein.\n​\n69\nNote 6—Income Taxes\n​\nThe components of income from continuing operations before income taxes and the provision for income taxes are as follows:\n​\n​\nThe United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) in December 2017.\nAs a result, in 2017,\nthe Company recorded a transition tax (“Transition Tax”) related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the Company paid its sixth annual installment of the Transition Tax, net of applicable tax credits and deductions.  The Company will pay the balance of the Transition Tax, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, over the remainder of the\neight-year\nperiod ending 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act.  The current and long-term portions of the Transition Tax are recorded in Accrued income taxes and Other long-term liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.  In addition, as a result of the Tax Act, the Company also recorded a tax\ncharge, in 2017, related to changes in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion, due to our intention to repatriate prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries over time.  We will pay such taxes when those respective earnings are repatriated.\n​\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had $\n177.3\nof foreign tax loss carryforwards, $\n101.7\nof U.S. state tax loss carryforwards and $\n9.1\nof U.S. federal tax loss carryforwards, of which $\n5.2\n, $\n101.7\nand $\n9.1\n, respectively, will either expire or be refunded at various dates through 2043 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely.  At December 31, 2023, the Company had $\n17.6\nof U.S. state tax credit carryforwards and $\n2.3\nof U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, of which $\n11.7\nand $\n2.3\n, respectively, will either expire or be refunded at various dates through 2043 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely.\n​\nA valuation allowance of $\n46.6\nand $\n42.2\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, has been recorded which relates primarily to the U.S. state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and U.S. state tax credits.  The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by\n$\n4.4\nin 2023, which was primarily driven by U.S. state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards.  The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by\n$\n2.7\nin 2022, which was primarily driven by foreign currency exchange.\n​\n70\nDifferences between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective income tax rate are analyzed below:\n​\n​\nThe components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following:\n​\n​\n​\nA tabular reconciliation of the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties at the beginning and end of the year for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is shown below.\n​\n​\n71\nThe Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.  During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the provision for income taxes included a net expense (benefit) of\n$\n5.8\n, $\n0.8\nand ($\n4.6\n)\n, respectively, in estimated interest and penalties.  As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits included\n$\n41.8\n, $\n35.8\nand $\n34.5\n, respectively, for tax-related interest and penalties.\n​\nThe Company operates in the U.S. and numerous foreign taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion.  With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2017 and after.  The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit.  The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by tax authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately\n$\n208.6\nand $\n194.4\n, respectively.  Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including the progress of tax audits and the closing of statutes of limitations.  Based on information currently available, management anticipates that over the next 12-month period, audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately\n$\n35.4\n.\n​\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\n​\nOn August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), a tax and spending package that introduces several tax-related provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases.  Companies will be required to reassess their valuation allowances for certain affected deferred tax assets in the period of enactment but will not need to remeasure deferred tax balances for the related tax accounting implications of the CAMT.  The IRA provisions, which became effective for Amphenol beginning on January 1, 2023, did not have a material impact on the Company during the year ended December 31, 2023.  While the full impact of these provisions in the future depends on several factors, including interpretive regulatory guidance, which has not yet been released, the Company does not currently believe that the provisions of the IRA, including several other non-tax related provisions, will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\n​\nNote 7—Equity\n​\nStock-Based Compensation:\n​\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s Income from continuing operations before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $\n99.0\n, $\n89.5\nand $\n83.0\n, respectively, the expense of which is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized aggregate income tax benefits (associated with stock-based compensation) of\n$\n92.4\n, $\n64.8\nand $\n71.7\n, respectively, in Provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  These aggregate income tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 include excess tax benefits of\n$\n82.4\n, $\n56.0\nand $\n63.4\n, respectively, from option exercises.   The impact associated with recognizing excess tax benefits from option exercises in the provision for income taxes on our consolidated financial statements could result in significant fluctuations in our effective tax rate in the future, since the provision for income taxes will be impacted by the timing and intrinsic value of future stock-based compensation award exercises.\n​\nStock Options\n​\nIn May 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the “2017 Employee Option Plan”), which provided for the issuance of\n60,000,000\nshares.  In March 2021, the Board authorized and approved the Amended and Restated 2017 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the “Amended 2017 Employee Option Plan” and, together with the 2017 Employee Option Plan, the “2017 Option Plan”), which among other things, increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan by\n40,000,000\nshares.  The Amended 2017 Employee Option Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders and became effective on May 19, 2021.  As of December 31, 2023, there were\n31,280,607\nshares of Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) available for the granting of additional stock options under the 2017 Option Plan.\n72\nPrior to the approval of the 2017 Employee Option Plan, the Company issued stock options under the 2009 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, and its amendment (the “2009 Employee Option Plan”).\nNo\nadditional stock options will be granted under the 2009 Employee Option Plan.  Options granted under the\n2017\nOption Plan and the\n2009\nEmployee Option Plan generally vest ratably over a period of\nfive years\nfrom the date of grant and are generally exercisable over a period of\n10 years\nfrom the date of grant.\n​\nStock option activity for 2021, 2022 and 2023 was as follows:\n​\n​\nA summary of the status of the Company’s non-vested options as of December 31, 2023 and changes during the year then ended is as follows:\n​\n​\nThe weighted average fair value at the grant date of options granted during 2022 and 2021 was $\n16.79\nand $\n13.27\n, respectively.\n​\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the following activity occurred under the Company’s option plans:\n​\n​\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was approximately $\n250.3\n, with a weighted average expected amortization period of\n3.36\nyears.\n​\nThe grant-date fair value of each option grant under the 2009 Employee Option Plan and the 2017 Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.\n73\nUse of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Common Stock and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options.  The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical experience.  The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Company’s dividend rate.\n​\nThe fair value of stock options has been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:\n​\n​\nRestricted Stock\n​\nIn 2012, the Company adopted the 2012 Restricted Stock Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan”).  The 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan expired on May 22, 2022.  The 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan was administered by the Board.  Grants under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan entitled the holder to receive shares of the Company’s Common Stock without payment.  Restricted shares granted under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan vested on the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or the day immediately prior to the date of the next regular annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders following such date of grant.\n​\nOn May 17, 2023,\n21,312\nshares of restricted stock previously granted to non-employee directors vested in accordance with their terms.  As of December 31, 2023,\nno\nadditional shares of restricted stock are outstanding under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan and, given that the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan has expired,\nno\nadditional shares of restricted stock will be granted thereunder.\n​\nRestricted share activity for 2021, 2022 and 2023 was as follows:\n​\n​\nThe total fair value of restricted share awards that vested during 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $\n1.4\n, $\n1.4\nand $\n1.2\n, respectively.\n​\n74\nPhantom Stock\n​\nOn June 5, 2023, the Company granted\n2,375\nshares of phantom stock to each then-current non-employee director (\n19,000\nshares in the aggregate), which will vest and, pursuant to written elections made by each non-employee director, convert into unrestricted shares of the Company’s Common Stock on the earlier of May 19, 2024 or the day immediately prior to the date of the 2024 annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders.  As of December 31, 2023, the total compensation cost related to non-vested shares of phantom stock not yet recognized was approximately $\n0.5\n(with a weighted average expected amortization period of\n0.37\nyears).\n​\nStock Repurchase Programs:\n​\nOn April 27, 2021, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $\n2,000.0\nof the Company’s Common Stock during the\nthree-year\nperiod\nending April 27, 2024 (the “2021 Stock Repurchase Program”).  During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased\n7.2\nmillion shares of its Common Stock for $\n585.1\n, of which\n5.5\nmillion shares, or $\n435.8\n, have been retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase.  During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased\n9.9\nmillion shares of its Common Stock for $\n730.5\n, of which\n9.3\nmillion shares, or $\n689.7\n, have been retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased\n6.2\nmillion shares of its Common Stock for $\n457.9\nunder the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, of which\n5.8\nmillion shares, or $\n424.9\n, were retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase.  From January 1, 2024 through January 31, 2024, the Company did\nno\nt repurchase any additional shares of its Common Stock, and, as of February 1, 2024, the Company has remaining authorization to purchase up to $\n226.5\nof its Common Stock under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program.  The timing and amount of any future purchases will depend on a number of factors, such as the levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock options exercised by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends paid, economic and market conditions and the price of the Common Stock.\n​\nOn April 24, 2018, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $\n2,000.0\nof Common Stock during the\nthree-year\nperiod ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”).  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased\n3.1\nmillion shares of its Common Stock for $\n203.8\nunder the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.  As a result of these purchases, the Company completed all purchases authorized under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, and, therefore, the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program was terminated.  Of the total repurchases made in 2021 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program,\n2.8\nmillion shares, or $\n184.0\n, were retired by the Company, with the remainder of the repurchased shares being retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase.\n​\nDividends:\n​\nContingent upon declaration by the Board, the Company pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock.  On October 25, 2022, the Board approved an increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend rate from\n$\n0.20\nper share to $\n0.21\nper share, effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2022, and on October 24, 2023, the Board approved an additional increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend rate from $\n0.21\nper share to $\n0.22\nper share, effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2023, contingent upon declaration by the Board.\nThe following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n​\n​\n75\nDividends declared and paid for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n​\n​\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):\n​\nBalances of related after-tax components comprising Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in equity at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n​\n​\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, as it relates to the Company’s cash flow hedges, which is comprised of foreign exchange forward contracts, the amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with foreign exchange forward contracts, as well as the amounts reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to foreign exchange gain (loss), included in Cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income, were not material. There were\nno\nreclassifications associated with our net investment hedges from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings during the years presented in the table above.   While there were\nno\noutstanding cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2023, any amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with cash flow hedges are generally reclassified into earnings within the following twelve months. The amounts reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings, related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the table above, are reported within Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the vast majority of which is related to the amortization of actuarial losses associated with our defined benefit plans.  The amortization of actuarial losses is included in the computation of net pension expense discussed in more detail within Note 9 herein.\n​\n76\n​\nNote 8—Earnings Per Share\n​\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations, discontinued operations and for total Amphenol Corporation, as well as a reconciliation of the basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, which were used to calculate the earnings per share (basic and diluted) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\n(note that per share amounts may not add due to rounding)\n:\n​\n​\nExcluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares (primarily related to outstanding stock options) of\n7.2\nmillion,\n9.0\nmillion and\n3.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n​\nNote 9—Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\n​\nDefined Benefit Plans\n​\nThe Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans (the “U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory.  The majority of U.S. employees are not covered by the U.S. Plans and are instead covered by various defined contribution plans.  The Company also has an unfunded Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which provides for the payment of the portion of annual pension that cannot be paid from the retirement plan as a result of regulatory limitations on average compensation for purposes of the benefit computation.  Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “Foreign Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”).  The largest foreign pension plan, in accordance with local regulations, is unfunded and had a projected benefit obligation of approximately\n$\n81.7\nand $\n71.5\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Total required contributions to be made during 2024 for the unfunded Foreign Plans are included in Other accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the tables below.\n​\n77\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s defined benefit plans’ funded status as of the most recent actuarial valuations as of December 31 of each year.\n​\n​\nThe projected benefit obligation decreased slightly in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to benefits paid during the year, which were largely offset by interest cost.\nThe projected benefit obligation decreased in 2022, primarily due to actuarial gains resulting from the impact of higher discount rates on our projected benefit obligation, along with foreign exchange translation and benefits paid during the year.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans was $\n557.0\nand $\n560.1\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. Plans was\n$\n388.2\nand $\n387.8\n, respectively, and for the Foreign Plans was $\n168.8\nand $\n172.3\n, respectively.\n​\n​\n78\n​\nThe following summarizes information for defined benefit plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n​\n​\nThe following summarizes information for defined benefit plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n​\n​\nThe amounts, before tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2023 and 2022 that have not yet been recognized as expense were as follows:\n​\n​\nThe following is a summary of the components of net pension expense for the Company’s defined benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n​\n​\n​\nThe pension expense for the Plans is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January\n1 of the applicable year, including mortality projections as well as a weighted average discount rate, rate of increase in future compensation levels and an expected long-term rate of return on the respective Plans’ assets which are detailed in the table above.  The Company records service costs in the same line item as the respective employee compensation costs and within operating income, while all non-service costs are reported separately within Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n​\n​\n79\nThe discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations.  The weighted average discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was\n4.97\n% and\n5.18\n%\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The decrease in the discount rate for the U.S. Plans resulted in an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately\n$\n7\nat December 31, 2023.  The weighted average discount rate for the Foreign Plans was\n3.72\n% and\n4.20\n%\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The decrease in the discount rate for the Foreign Plans did not have a material effect on the benefit obligation at December 31, 2023\n.  T\nhe Company calculates its service and interest costs by applying a split discount rate approach under which specific spot rates along the selected yield curve are applied to the relevant projected cash flows as the Company believes this method more precisely measures its obligations. The mortality assumptions used by the Company reflect commonly used mortality tables and improvement scales for each plan and increased life expectancies for plan participants.\n​\nThe primary investment objective of the Plans is to ensure an adequate pool of assets to support the benefit obligations to participants, retirees and beneficiaries.  Over time, the Plans have aimed to earn a rate of return on assets greater than the liability discount rate, with a prudent level of risk and diversification.  For the U.S. Plans, this has resulted in assets exceeding benefit obligations.  In an effort to reduce the funding status volatility of the Plans, the target asset allocations for the U.S. Plans were\n15\n% equities and\n85\n%\nfixed income as of December 31, 2023, and the Company expects to maintain these target asset allocations for the U.S. Plans for 2024.  The target asset allocations for the U.S. Plans were\n25\n% equities and\n75\n% fixed income as of December 31, 2022.  Short-term strategic ranges for investments will continue to be established within these new long-term target percentages.  The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate.\n​\nThe Company invests in a diversified investment portfolio through various investment managers and evaluates its plan assets for the existence of concentration risks.  As of December 31, 2023, there were no significant concentrations of risks in the Company’s defined benefit plan assets.  The Company does not invest nor instruct investment managers to invest pension assets in Amphenol securities.  The Plans may indirectly hold the Company’s securities as a result of external investment management in certain commingled funds.  Such holdings would not be material relative to the Plans’ total assets.  The Company’s Foreign Plans primarily invest in equity and debt securities and insurance contracts, as determined by each Plans’ Trustees or investment managers.\n​\nIn developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company relies primarily on projected long-term asset returns by asset class prepared annually by our investment consultants.  For 2023, the expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plans’ assets was based on an asset allocation assumption of approximately\n25\n% with equity managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately\n6.0\n%) and\n75\n% with fixed income managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately\n5.3\n%).\n​\n80\nThe Company’s Plan assets, the vast majority of which relate to the U.S. Plans, are reported at fair value and classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The process requires judgment and may have an effect on the placement of the Plan assets within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The fair values of the Company’s pension Plans’ assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 by asset category are as follows (refer to Note 5 for definitions of Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs):\n​\n​\n​\nEquity securities primarily consist of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. equities.  Publicly traded securities are valued at the last trade or closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.  Certain equity securities held in commingled funds are valued at unitized net asset value (“NAV”) based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the funds.  Alternative investment funds include investments in hedge funds including fund of fund products.\n​\nFixed income securities primarily consist of government securities and corporate bonds.  They are valued at the closing price in the active market or at quotes obtained from brokers/dealers or pricing services.  Certain fixed income securities held within commingled funds are valued based on the fair value of the underlying net assets of the funds, as determined by the custodian of the funds.\n​\nThe Level 2 pension plan assets are comprised primarily of pooled funds valued using published prices based off of observable market data.\n​\n81\nThe Level 3 pension plan assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in the table above primarily consist of contracts with insurance companies related to certain foreign plans.  The insurance contracts generally include guarantees in accordance with the policy purchased.  Our valuation of Level 3 assets is based on insurance company or third-party actuarial valuations, representing an estimation of the surrender or market values of the insurance contract between the Company and the insurance companies.  The following table sets forth a summary of changes of the fair value of the Level 3 pension plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n​\n​\nThe Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $\n5.4\n, $\n6.3\n, and $\n6.8\nin 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nThere is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future, if any.\n​\nBenefit payments related to the Plans above, including those amounts to be paid out of Company assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be as follows:\n​\n​\nCertain foreign subsidiaries of the Company offer certain benefits under local statutory plans which are excluded from the tables above.  The net liability for such plans was\n$\n30.9\nand $\n15.6\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the majority of which is included within Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\n​\nThe Company maintains self-insurance programs for that portion of its health care and workers compensation costs not covered by insurance. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retirees in the U.S. through postretirement benefit (“OPEB”) programs. The Company’s share of the cost of such plans for most participants is fixed, and any increase in the cost of such plans will be the responsibility of the retirees. The Company funds the benefit costs for such plans on a pay-as-you-go basis.  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, t\nhe total liability associated with postretirement benefit obligations was approximately $\n3.9\nand $\n4.3\n, respectively, the majority of which is included in Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The weighted average discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was\n5.00\n% and\n5.22\n%\n, respectively.  Net postretirement benefit expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income was not material for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.  Since the Company’s obligation for postretirement medical plans is fixed and since the benefit obligation and the net postretirement benefit expense are not material in relation to the Company’s financial condition or results of operations, the Company believes any change in medical costs from that estimated will not have a significant impact on the Company.\n​\nDefined Contribution Plans\n​\nThe Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. Through December 31, 2022, the Company matched employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans up to a maximum of\n6\n% of eligible compensation. Effective\n82\nJanuary 1, 2023, the Company increased its matching of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans to a maximum of\n7\n%\nof eligible compensation.  The Company provided matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately\n$\n24.0\n, $\n18.0\nand $\n16.2\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n​\nNote 10—Leases\n​\nOperating Leases\n​\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, total operating lease cost was $\n127.1\n, $\n121.4\n, and $\n118.2\n, respectively, which include an immaterial amount of variable lease cost, and is recorded in Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses, dependent on the nature of the leased asset.  Other than variable lease cost, operating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The following summarizes (i) the future minimum undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter, incorporating the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for our existing real estate leases and (ii) a reconciliation of the undiscounted lease payments to the present value of the lease liabilities recognized, all as of December 31, 2023:\n​\n​\nThe following summarizes the operating lease-related account balances on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n​\n​\nThe following summarizes additional supplemental data related to our operating leases:\n​\n​\nLease contracts that we have executed but which have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2023 were not material, and are excluded from the tables above.  The Company does not generally enter into leases involving the construction or design of the underlying asset, and nearly all of the assets we lease are not specialized in nature.  Our lease agreements generally do not include residual value guarantees nor do we enter into sublease arrangements with external parties.\n​\n83\nFinance Leases\n​\nIn rare circumstances, the Company may enter into finance leases for specific equipment used in manufacturing, in which the Company takes ownership of the asset upon the end of the lease.  The Company records its finance leases within Property, plant and equipment, net, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company’s finance leases and related depreciation and interest expense, cash flows and impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements were not material individually or in the aggregate as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n​\n​\nNote 11—Acquisitions\n​\n2023 Acquisitions\n​\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed\n10\nacquisitions (the “2023 Acquisitions”) for approximately $\n970.4\n, net of cash acquired.\nFive\nof the acquisitions have been included in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment,\nthree\nacquisitions have been included in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, and\ntwo\nacquisitions have been included in the Communications Solutions segment.  The 2023 Acquisitions were each funded using cash on hand or borrowings under our Commercial Paper Programs, or a combination thereof.\nOne\nof the 2023 Acquisitions, which closed in the second quarter of 2023, represented a bargain purchase, where the estimated fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, exceeded the purchase price.  The Company recognized a non-cash gain of\n$\n5.4\non the bargain purchase acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2023, which has been recorded separately in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2023, the 2023 Acquisitions resulted in the recognition of $\n609.4\nof goodwill and $\n181.3\nof definite-lived intangible assets, comprised of customer relationships, proprietary technology and acquired backlog, with the remainder of the purchase price being allocated to other identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed.  These definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized based upon the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by the future net cash inflows, with the acquired customer relationships and\nproprietary\ntechnology\nhaving useful lives ranging from\n6\nto\n15 years\nand the acquired backlog having a useful life of approximately\n0.25\nyears.  The excess purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, which primarily represents the value of the assembled workforce along with other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition.  The Company expects that approximately\n$\n145\nof the goodwill recognized from the 2023 Acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes.  The Company is in the process of analyzing and completing the allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for these acquisitions.  Since the current purchase price allocations are based on preliminary assessments made by management as of December 31, 2023, the acquisition accounting is subject to final adjustments, and it is possible that the final assessments of values may differ from our preliminary assessments.  The operating results of the 2023 Acquisitions have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023 since their respective dates of acquisition.  Pro forma financial information, as well as further details regarding the purchase price allocations related to these acquisitions, have not been presented, since the 2023 Acquisitions are not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s financial results.\n​\n2022 Acquisitions\n​\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed\ntwo\nacquisitions (the “2022 Acquisitions”) for approximately $\n288.2\n, net of cash acquired.  The 2022 Acquisitions were funded through a combination of borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and cash on hand.\nOne\nacquisition was included in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment, while the\nother\nacquisition was included in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment.  The Company completed the acquisition accounting, including the analyses of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, for all of the 2022 Acquisitions, and each of the final assessments of values did not differ materially from their previous preliminary assessments.  The operating results of the 2022 Acquisitions were included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since their respective dates of acquisition.  Pro forma financial information, as well as further details regarding the purchase price allocation related to these acquisitions, was not presented, since the 2022 Acquisitions were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s financial results.\n​\n84\n2021 Acquisitions\n​\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed\nseven\nacquisitions (the “2021 Acquisitions”) for $\n2,225.4\n, net of cash acquired, while also completing the divestiture of the Divested MTS business, as discussed below.\nOne\nof the acquisitions was included in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment,\nthree\nacquisitions were included in the Communications Solutions segment, and\nthree\nacquisitions were included in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment.  The Company completed the acquisition accounting, including the analyses of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, for all of the 2021 Acquisitions, and each of the final assessments of values did not differ materially from their previous preliminary assessments.  The operating results of the 2021 Acquisitions were included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since their respective dates of acquisition.  Pro forma financial information, as well as further details regarding the purchase price allocation related to these acquisitions, was not presented, since the 2021 Acquisitions were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s financial results.\n​\nAcquisition of MTS Systems Corporation\n​\nOn December 9, 2020, Amphenol announced that the Company entered into a definitive agreement under which Amphenol would acquire MTS Systems Corporation (Nasdaq: MTSC) (“MTS”) for $\n58.50\nper share in cash.  MTS, a leading global supplier of precision sensors, advanced test systems and motion simulators, was historically organized into\ntwo\nbusiness segments: Sensors (“MTS Sensors”) and Test & Simulation (“MTS T&S”).  The MTS Sensors business provides the Company with a highly complementary offering of high-technology, harsh environment sensors sold into diverse end markets and applications.  The MTS Sensors business has further expanded the Company’s range of sensor and sensor-based products across a wide array of industries and is reported as part of our continuing operations and within our Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment.  On January 19, 2021 and prior to the closing of the MTS acquisition, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell MTS (including the MTS T&S business, but excluding the MTS Sensors business) to Illinois Tool Works Inc. (“ITW”).  Throughout this Annual Report, we refer to MTS (including the MTS T&S business, but excluding the MTS Sensors business) as the “Divested MTS business”.\n​\nOn April 7, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of MTS for a total enterprise value of approximately $\n1,700\n, net of cash acquired and including the repayment of all outstanding debt and certain liabilities.  The MTS acquisition was funded through a combination of borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and cash on hand.  At closing, the Company paid approximately\n$\n1,300\n, net of cash acquired, for\n100\n% of the common stock of MTS, including certain liabilities settled at closing, which was reflected within Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2021.  In addition, the Company also assumed MTS’s then-outstanding\n$\n350.0\nprincipal amount of senior notes due August 15, 2027.  Shortly after the closing, the Company repaid and settled the MTS senior notes for approximately\n$\n387.3\n, which included accrued interest and a make-whole premium incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of the senior notes.  The repayment of the outstanding senior notes, including the make-whole premium and excluding interest, was reflected within Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2021.  On December 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of the Divested MTS business to ITW for approximately $\n750\n, net of cash divested and excluding related transaction fees and expenses.  After giving effect to the sale of the Divested MTS business as well as the repayment of the aforementioned MTS senior notes as part of the MTS acquisition, the Company paid approximately $\n950\n, net of cash acquired and excluding related transaction fees and expenses, for the retained MTS Sensors business.  Refer to “\nPresentation and Sale of the Divested MTS Business\n” section below for further details related to the Company’s discontinued operations and the completed divestiture of the Divested MTS business.\n​\nThe purchase price allocation for the MTS Sensors business was performed separately from the Divested MTS business, the latter of which was accounted for as discontinued operations and whose assets acquired, including associated goodwill, and liabilities assumed were reported as current assets held for sale and current liabilities held for sale on the Company’s balance sheet.  As a result of the sale of the Divested MTS business on December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition accounting associated with the Divested MTS business and the associated current assets held for sale and current\nliabilities\nheld for sale were\nno\nlonger reported on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\n​\n85\nThe retained MTS Sensors business is reported within our Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment.  In 2022, the Company completed its analysis of the purchase price allocation of the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as part of the acquisition accounting associated with the MTS Sensors business.  The final assessment of values for the MTS Sensors business did not differ materially from previous preliminary assessments.  The MTS acquisition resulted in the recognition of\n$\n738.7\nof goodwill, $\n54.0\nof indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets and $\n178.2\nof definite-lived intangible assets, each associated with the MTS Sensors business.  The definite-lived intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships, proprietary technology, and backlog of\n$\n122.9\n, $\n39.1\nand $\n16.2\n, respectively, and are amortized based upon the underlying pattern of economic benefit with weighted average useful lives of\n11 years\n,\n15 years\nand\n0.25\nyears, respectively.  Other than these intangible assets, the remainder of the purchase price was allocated to other identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  As part of acquisition accounting, the Company also recorded\n$\n47.0\nof deferred tax liabilities associated with certain basis differences, the majority of which the Company recognized for tax purposes and paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 upon the sale of the Divested MTS business.  The excess purchase price over the fair value of the underlying assets acquired (net of liabilities assumed) was allocated to goodwill, which primarily represents the value of assembled workforce and the anticipated cost savings and efficiencies associated with the integration of the MTS Sensors business, along with other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition.  The Company does\nno\nt expect any such recognized goodwill associated with the acquisition of the MTS Sensors business to be deductible for tax purposes.  The operating results for the MTS Sensors business have been included within continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the acquisition date of April 7, 2021, while the operating results for the Divested MTS business were classified and reported as discontinued operations as discussed further below.\n​\nPresentation and Sale of the Divested MTS Business\n​\nOn January 19, 2021 and prior to the closing of the MTS acquisition, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Divested MTS business to ITW.  As a result of the a\ngreement to sell the Divested MTS business to ITW, the Divested MTS business met the discontinued operations reporting criteria and “held for sale” accounting criteria as of the MTS acquisition date of April 7, 2021, and therefore, the Company did not assign the Divested MTS business to any of its\nthree\nreportable business segments.  Accordingly, since the Divested MTS business had never been nor was expected to ever be considered part of our continuing operations, the Company accounted for the operating results and related cash flows associated with the Divested MTS business as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, respectively, as of the MTS acquisition date through December 1, 2021, the date of the sale of the Divested MTS business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the comprehensive income associated with discontinued operations was not material and was not presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The Company also ceased recording depreciation and amortization on the held for sale assets as of the MTS acquisition date.\n​\nAs discussed above, the purchase price allocation associated with the Divested MTS business was performed separately from the MTS Sensors business, as the Divested MTS business met the “held for sale” accounting criteria.  The assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the purchase price allocation for the Divested MTS business were measured and recorded at fair value less costs to sell, which was considered a Level 3 fair value measurement based on the transaction’s then-expected consideration.  Such assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded as current assets held for sale and current liabilities held for sale, as separate single line items on the Company’s balance sheet as of the MTS acquisition date through December 1, 2021, the date of the sale of the Divested MTS business.  At each reporting period in 2021, the Company reassessed the fair value of these assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale and noted that the carrying value of the disposal group did not exceed its fair value less costs to sell.  In addition, the Company assumed a\n$\n28.7\ncontingent consideration liability from the MTS acquisition, which was recognized at fair value as part of acquisition accounting.  This contingent consideration was recorded within current liabilities held for sale on the Company’s balance sheet as of the acquisition date.  During the third quarter of 2021, the Company made a capital contribution to the Divested MTS business, which in turn used the funding to settle the contingent consideration.\n​\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of the Divested MTS business to ITW for approximately $\n750\n, net of cash divested and excluding related transaction fees and expenses\n.\nThe proceeds from the sale of the Divested MTS business were included in Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAmphenol has had no continuing involvement with the Divested MTS business after the completion of the sale.  The sale of the Divested MTS business did not result in any significant gain or loss recorded to discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n​\n86\nAcquisition of Halo Technology Limited\n​\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately\n97\n% of the common stock of Halo Technology Limited (“Halo”) for a purchase price of approximately $\n694\n, net of cash acquired.  The sellers retained a noncontrolling interest of less than\n3\n%\nin Halo, which includes redeemable features that are outside the control of the Company and therefore, is classified as temporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, as discussed in more detail in Notes 1 and 5 herein.  The acquisition was funded with cash on hand.  Halo, which is headquartered in the United States (California), is a leading provider of active and passive fiber optic interconnect components, with product offerings that are highly complementary to our existing high-speed and fiber optic interconnect solutions for the communications infrastructure markets.  In 2022, the Company completed the acquisition accounting related to the Halo acquisition, specifically associated with the purchase price allocation of the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interest assumed.  The final assessment of values for the Halo acquisition did not differ materially from previous preliminary assessments.  The Halo acquisition resulted in the recognition of\n$\n522.1\nof goodwill, $\n29.0\nof indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets and $\n168.0\nof definite-lived intangible assets.  The definite-lived intangible assets were comprised of customer relationships, proprietary technology, and backlog of\n$\n44.0\n, $\n115.0\nand $\n9.0\n, respectively, and are amortized based upon the underlying pattern of economic benefit with weighted average useful lives of\n13 years\n,\n15 years\nand\none month\n, respectively.  Other than these intangible assets, the remainder of the purchase price was allocated to other identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interests (including redeemable noncontrolling interests) assumed.  As part of acquisition accounting, the excess purchase price over the fair value of the underlying assets acquired (net of liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed) was allocated to goodwill, which primarily represents the value of assembled workforce and the anticipated cost savings and efficiencies associated with the integration of Halo, along with other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition.  The Company does\nno\nt expect any such recognized goodwill associated with the Halo acquisition to be deductible for tax purposes.  The operating results for Halo were included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the acquisition date.  The acquisition of Halo, which is reported within our Communications Solutions segment, was not material to the Company’s financial results.\n​\nAcquisition-related Expenses\n​\nIn 2023, the Company incurred $\n34.6\n($\n30.2\nafter-tax) of acquisition-related expenses, comprised primarily of external transaction costs associated with the 2023 Acquisitions, as well as the amortization of $\n12.4\nrelated to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from\nthree\nof the 2023 Acquisitions.\nIn 2022, the Company incurred\n$\n21.5\n($\n18.4\nafter-tax) of acquisition-related expenses, comprised primarily of the amortization of $\n12.0\nrelated to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from the 2022 Acquisitions, along with external transaction costs.  In 2021, the Company incurred\n$\n70.4\n($\n57.3\nafter-tax) of acquisition-related expenses, comprised primarily of transaction, severance, restructuring and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the MTS acquisition in the second quarter of 2021, along with external transaction costs and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the Halo acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Such acquisition-related expenses are presented separately in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income\n.\n​\n​\nNote 12—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n​\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:\n​\n​\nThe increase in goodwill during 2023 was primarily driven by goodwill recognized from the 2023 Acquisitions.  The increase in goodwill during 2022 was primarily driven by goodwill recognized from the 2022 Acquisitions, partially offset by foreign currency translation.\n​\n87\nOther than goodwill noted above, the Company’s intangible assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n​\n​\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount of intangible assets in 2023 was primarily driven by customer relationships and proprietary technology resulting from acquisition accounting associated with certain 2023 Acquisitions.  Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately\n$\n86.0\n, $\n81.0\nand $\n86.4\n, respectively, which included the amortization of acquired backlog of $\n12.4\n, $\n12.0\n, and $\n25.2\n, respectively, resulting from acquisitions in each respective year.  As of December 31, 2023, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately\n$\n93.0\nin 2024 (which includes the estimated amortization of acquired backlog resulting from certain acquisitions that closed late in 2023), $\n68.9\nin 2025, $\n67.3\nin 2026, $\n60.5\nin 2027, and $\n53.2\nin 2028.\n​\nNote 13—Reportable Business Segments and International Operations\n​\nSince January 1, 2022, the Company aligns its businesses into\nthree\nreportable business segments:\n(i)\nHarsh Environment Solutions\n,\n(ii)\nCommunications Solutions\nand\n(iii)\nInterconnect and Sensor Systems\n.  This segment structure reflects (i) the manner in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, regularly assesses information for decision-making purposes, including the allocation of resources, and (ii) how the Company operates its businesses, assesses performance, and communicates results and strategy, among other items, to the Board and its stockholders.  The Company has\nthree\nsegment managers to lead their respective reportable business segments, each reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer.  The Company organizes its reportable business segments based on the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company, combined with the nature of the individual business activities and the product-based solutions offered.\n​\nThe following are the Company’s\nthree\nreportable business segments:\n​\n●\nHarsh Environment Solutions\n– the Harsh Environment Solutions segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of ruggedized interconnect products, including connectors and interconnect systems, printed circuits and printed circuit assemblies and other products for use in the industrial, defense, commercial aerospace, automotive, mobile networks and information technology and data communications end markets.\n​\n●\nCommunications Solutions\n– the Communications Solutions segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of connector and interconnect systems, including high speed, radio frequency, power, fiber optic and other products, together with antennas, for use in the information technology and data communications, mobile devices, industrial, mobile networks, broadband communications, automotive, commercial aerospace and defense end markets.\n​\n●\nInterconnect and Sensor Systems\n– the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of sensors, sensor-based systems, connectors and value-add interconnect systems used in the automotive, industrial, information technology and data communications, mobile networks, defense and commercial aerospace end markets.\n​\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole, as described in Note\n1 herein.  The Company evaluates the performance of the segments and allocates resources to each of them based on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before certain corporate and other related items such as interest, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, amortization related to certain intangible assets and nonrecurring gains and losses.  The Company also incurs general corporate expenses and costs which are not allocated to the reportable business\n88\nsegments but have been included in “Corporate / Other” in the following tables for reconciliation purposes.  Assets are reviewed by the CODM on a consolidated basis and therefore are not presented by reportable business segment.\n​\nNet sales by segment for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n​\n​\nSegment operating income and the reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n​\n​\nDepreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\n​\n​\n89\nNet sales by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and long-lived assets by geographic area as of December 31 were as follows:\n​\n​\n​\nDisaggregation of Net Sales\n​\nThe following tables show our net sales disaggregated into categories the Company considers meaningful to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNet sales by geographic area are based on the customer location to which the product is shipped.\nNo\nsingle customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n90\n2021.  It is impracticable to disclose net sales by product or group of products.  For further discussion related to the Company’s policies surrounding revenue recognition, refer to Note 1 herein.\n​\nReportable Business Segments Prior to 2022\n​\nPrior to 2022 and through December 31, 2021, the Company operated through\ntwo\nreportable business segments:\n​\n●\nInterconnect Products and Assemblies\n– The Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment primarily designed, manufactured and marketed a broad range of connector and connector systems, value-add products and other products, including antennas and sensors, used in a wide range of applications in a diverse set of end markets.\n​\n●\nCable Products and Solutions\n– The Cable Products and Solutions segment primarily designed, manufactured and marketed cable, value-add products and components for use primarily in the broadband communications and information technology markets, as well as certain applications in other markets.\n​\nBusinesses previously reported in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment were aligned with\none\nof the Company’s\nthree\nsegments, while all businesses previously reported in the Cable Products and Solutions segment were aligned with the Communications Solutions segment\n.\n​\nNote 14—Commitments and Contingencies\n​\nThe Company is party to a number of legal and/or regulatory actions arising out of the normal course of its business.  The Company records a loss contingency liability when, in the opinion of management after seeking legal advice, a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  Based on information currently available and management’s evaluation of such information, the Company does not believe that the resolution of any existing legal or regulatory action is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  The Company’s legal costs associated with defending itself are recorded to expense as incurred.\n​\nCertain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.  The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\nThe Company also has purchase obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services.  At December 31, 2023, the Company had purchase commitments of\n$\n932.4\nin 2024, $\n28.1\nin 2025 and 2026, combined, and $\n8.2\nbeyond 2026.\n​\nNote 15—Subsequent Events\n​\nOn\nJanuary 30, 2024\n, the Company entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement by and between the Company and Carlisle Companies Incorporated (“Carlisle”), agreeing to acquire the Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (“CIT”) business of Carlisle for an aggregate purchase price of $\n2,025\nin cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.  The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2024 and is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  The Company expects to finance the CIT acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing, which could include borrowings under the Company’s existing credit and/or U.S. Commercial Paper Program.  CIT, headquartered in St. Augustine, FL, is a leading global supplier of harsh environment interconnect solutions primarily to the commercial aerospace, defense and industrial end markets.  CIT’s wide range of products include wire and cable, cable assemblies, contacts, connectors and sensors, which, management believes, are highly complementary to Amphenol’s existing interconnect and sensor solutions.  If and when the acquisition is consummated, the Company expects to report the CIT business within its Harsh Environment Solutions segment.\n​\n​\n​\n91\n​\n​"

Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2023.\n​\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n​\nManagement Report on Internal Control\n​\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Due to its inherent limitations, i\nnternal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of Amphenol Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”), as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n​\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).

Deloitte & Touche LLP has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n​"
