We\nperform our annual goodwill and\nindefinite-lived intangible assets impairment\ntest as\nof the\nfirst day\nof the\nsecond quarter\nof the\nfiscal year.\nImpairment testing\nis performed\nfor each\nof our\nreporting units.\nWe\ncompare\nthe\ncarrying\nvalue\nof\na\nreporting\nunit,\nincluding\ngoodwill,\nto\nthe\nfair\nvalue\nof\nthe\nunit.\nCarrying\nvalue\nis\nbased\non\nthe\nassets\nand\nliabilities\nassociated\nwith\nthe\noperations\nof\nthat\nreporting\nunit,\nwhich\noften\nrequires\nallocation\nof\nshared\nor\ncorporate\nitems\namong\nreporting\nunits.\nIf\nthe\ncarrying\namount\nof\na\nreporting\nunit\nexceeds\nits\nfair\nvalue,\nimpairment\nhas\noccurred.\nWe\nrecognize\nan\nimpairment charge\nfor the\namount by\nwhich the carrying\namount of\nthe reporting\nunit exceeds\nits fair\nvalue up\nto the\ntotal amount\nof\ngoodwill allocated\nto the\nreporting unit.\nOur estimates\nof fair\nvalue are\ndetermined based\non a\ndiscounted\ncash flow\nmodel. Growth\nrates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range\nplanning process. We also make\nestimates of discount rates,\nperpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.\nWe evaluate the\nuseful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to\ndetermine if they are finite or indefinite-lived.\nReaching a\ndetermination\non\nuseful\nlife\nrequires\nsignificant\njudgments\nand\nassumptions\nregarding\nthe\nfuture\neffects\nof\nobsolescence,\ndemand,\ncompetition, other economic\nfactors (such as the\nstability of the industry,\nknown technological advances,\nlegislative action that\nresults\n48\nin an uncertain or\nchanging regulatory environment,\nand expected changes in\ndistribution channels), the level\nof required maintenance\nexpenditures,\nand\nthe\nexpected\nlives\nof\nother\nrelated\ngroups\nof\nassets.\nIntangible\nassets\nthat\nare\ndeemed\nto\nhave\nfinite\nlives\nare\namortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging\nfrom\n4\nto\n30\nyears.\nOur indefinite-lived\nintangible assets,\nmainly intangible\nassets primarily\nassociated with\nthe\nBlue Buffalo\n,\nPillsbury\n,\nTotino’s\n,\nOld El\nPaso\n,\nProgresso\n,\nAnnie’s\n,\nNudges\n, and\nHäagen-Dazs\nbrands, are also tested\nfor impairment annually\nand whenever events or\nchanges\nin circumstances\nindicate that\ntheir carrying\nvalue may\nnot be\nrecoverable. Our\nestimate of\nthe fair\nvalue of\nthe brands\nis based\non a\ndiscounted\ncash\nflow\nmodel\nusing\ninputs\nwhich\nincluded\nprojected\nrevenues\nfrom\nour\nlong-range\nplan,\nassumed\nroyalty\nrates\nthat\ncould be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.\nOur finite-lived intangible\nassets, primarily acquired\ncustomer relationships, are\nreviewed for impairment\nwhenever events or changes\nin circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying amount\nof an asset may not\nbe recoverable. An impairment\nloss would be recognized\nwhen\nestimated undiscounted future cash\nflows from the operation and disposition\nof the asset are less than the\ncarrying amount of the asset.\nAssets generally\nhave identifiable\ncash flows\nand are\nlargely independent\nof other\nassets. Measurement\nof an\nimpairment loss\nwould\nbe\nbased on\nthe\nexcess of\nthe carrying\namount of\nthe asset\nover\nits fair\nvalue.\nFair\nvalue\nis measured\nusing\na discounted\ncash\nflow\nmodel or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.\nLeases\nWe\ndetermine whether\nan arrangement\nis a lease\nat inception.\nWhen our\nlease arrangements\ninclude lease and\nnon-lease components,\nwe account for lease and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance)\nseparately based on their relative standalone prices.\nAny\nlease\narrangements\nwith\nan\ninitial\nterm\nof\n12\nmonths\nor\nless\nare\nnot\nrecorded\non\nour\nConsolidated\nBalance\nSheets,\nand\nwe\nrecognize lease costs for these\nlease arrangements on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term. Many\nof our lease arrangements provide\nus with\noptions to\nexercise one\nor more\nrenewal terms\nor to\nterminate the\nlease arrangement.\nWe\ninclude these\noptions when\nwe are\nreasonably certain\nto exercise them\nin the lease\nterm used to\nestablish our\nright of use\nassets and lease\nliabilities. Generally,\nour lease\nagreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees,\nor material restrictive covenants.\nWe\nhave\ncertain\nlease\narrangements\nwith\nvariable\nrental\npayments.\nOur\nlease\narrangements\nfor\nour\nHäagen-Dazs\nretail\nshops\noften\ninclude rental payments\nthat are based\non a percentage\nof retail sales. We\nhave other lease\narrangements that are\nadjusted periodically\nbased on\nan inflation\nindex or rate.\nThe future\nvariability of these\npayments and\nadjustments are\nunknown, and\ntherefore they\nare not\nincluded\nas\nminimum\nlease\npayments\nused\nto\ndetermine\nour\nright\nof\nuse\nassets\nand\nlease\nliabilities.\nVariable\nrental\npayments\nare\nrecognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.\nAs\nmost\nof\nour\nlease\narrangements\ndo\nnot\nprovide\nan\nimplicit\ninterest\nrate,\nwe\napply\nan\nincremental\nborrowing\nrate\nbased\non\nthe\ninformation available at the commencement date of the lease arrangement\nto determine the present value of lease payments.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOur\ninvestments\nin\ncompanies\nover\nwhich\nwe\nhave\nthe\nability\nto\nexercise\nsignificant\ninfluence\nare\nstated\nat\ncost\nplus\nour\nshare\nof\nundistributed\nearnings\nor\nlosses.\nWe\nreceive\nroyalty\nincome\nfrom\ncertain\njoint\nventures,\nincur\nvarious\nexpenses\n(primarily\nresearch\nand\ndevelopment),\nand\nrecord\nthe\ntax\nimpact\nof\ncertain\njoint\nventure\noperations\nthat\nare\nstructured\nas\npartnerships.\nIn\naddition,\nwe\nmake\nadvances\nto\nour\njoint\nventures\nin\nthe\nform\nof\nloans\nor\ncapital\ninvestments.\nWe\nalso\nsell\ncertain\nraw\nmaterials,\nsemi-finished\ngoods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices.\nIn addition,\nwe assess our\ninvestments in our\njoint ventures if\nwe have reason\nto believe an\nimpairment may have\noccurred including,\nbut not\nlimited to,\nas a\nresult of\nongoing operating\nlosses, projected\ndecreases in\nearnings, increases\nin the\nweighted-average\ncost of\ncapital,\nor\nsignificant\nbusiness\ndisruptions.\nThe\nsignificant\nassumptions\nused\nto\nestimate\nfair\nvalue\ninclude\nrevenue\ngrowth\nand\nprofitability,\nroyalty\nrates,\ncapital\nspending,\ndepreciation\nand\ntaxes,\nforeign\ncurrency\nexchange\nrates,\nand\na\ndiscount\nrate.\nBy\ntheir\nnature, these projections\nand assumptions are uncertain.\nIf we were to\ndetermine the current\nfair value of our\ninvestment was less than\nthe carrying value of\nthe investment, then we\nwould assess if the\nshortfall was of a temporary\nor permanent nature and\nwrite down the\ninvestment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues primarily result\nfrom contracts with customers,\nwhich are generally short-term\nand have a single performance\nobligation\n– the\ndelivery of\nproduct.
