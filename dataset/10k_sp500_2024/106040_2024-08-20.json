We focus our engineering efforts on optimizing our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective and timely manner. For a discussion of associated risks, see Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPatents, Licenses and Proprietary Information\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our IP rights.\nWe have approximately 13,000 active patents worldwide and have many patent applications in process. We continually seek additional United States (“U.S.”) and international patents on our technology. We believe that, although our active patents and patent applications have considerable value, the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products also depends upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff. Accordingly, the patents held and applied for cannot alone ensure our future success.\nIn addition to patent protection of certain IP rights, we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential. We believe that our non-patented IP, particularly some of our process technology, is an important factor in our success. We rely upon non-disclosure agreements, contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information. Despite these safeguards, there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information. The laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the laws of the U.S.\nWe rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products. We believe that we have adequate cross-licenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own IP portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry. For a discussion of associated risks, see Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.\nManufacturing and Suppliers\nWe believe that we have significant know-how, unique product manufacturing processes, test and tooling, execution skills, human resources and training to continue to be successful and to adjust our manufacturing operations as necessary. We strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility, high manufacturing yields, reliable products and high-quality components. The critical elements of our production of both HDD and Flash are high volume and utilization, low-cost assembly and testing, strict adherence to quality metrics and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access best-in-class technology and manufacturing capacity. We continually monitor our manufacturing capabilities to respond to the changing requirements of our customers and maintain our competitiveness and position as a data technology leader.\nHDD and Flash manufacturing are each complex processes involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and rigorous testing. The manufacturing processes involve a number of steps that are dependent on each other and occur in “clean room” environments that demand skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of these manufacturing environments. We continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity, sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs. We continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs. We also leverage contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous. For more information on our agreement to sell a majority interest in one of our manufacturing facilities, see Part II, Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n–\nKey Developments\n.\nHDD consists primarily of recording heads, magnetic media, controllers and firmware and a printed circuit board assembly. We design and manufacture substantially all of the recording heads and magnetic media required for our products. As a result, we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts for these components and less reliant on recording head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers. We depend on an external supply base for all remaining components and materials for use in our HDD design, manufacturing and testing. We believe the use of our in-house manufacturing, assembly and test facilities provides the controls necessary to provide the demanding capabilities, performance and reliability our customers require.\n7\nOur vertically integrated, in-house assembly and test operations for our HDD products are concentrated in Prachinburi and Bang Pa-In, Thailand; Penang, Johor Bahru, and Kuching, Malaysia; Laguna, Philippines; Shenzhen, China; and San Jose and Fremont, CA, USA.\nSubstantially all of our flash memory supply utilized for our flash-based products is purchased from our joint ventures with Kioxia. From time to time, we also purchase flash memory from other flash manufacturers. Controllers are primarily designed in-house and manufactured by third-party foundries or acquired from third-party suppliers. We believe the use of our assembly and test facilities, as well as contract manufacturers, provides flexibility and gives us access to increased production capacity. We have developed deep relationships with these vendors and Kioxia to establish a continuous supply of flash-based memory and controllers.\nWe generally retain multiple suppliers for our component requirements, but for business or technology reasons, we source some of our components from a limited number of sole or single source providers. For a discussion of such risks, see Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nVentures with Kioxia\nOur flash-based products consist of flash-based memory, controllers and firmware and other components. Substantially all of our flash-based memory is obtained from our joint ventures with Kioxia, which provide us with leading-edge, high-quality and low-cost flash memory wafers.\nWe and Kioxia currently operate three business ventures, Flash Partners Ltd., Flash Alliance Ltd. and Flash Forward Ltd., (collectively “Flash Ventures”) across seven flash-based manufacturing facilities in Japan, six of which are located in Yokkaichi, Japan and one of which is located in Kitakami, Japan. Flash Ventures will begin flash-based manufacturing operations at an eighth facility in Japan in calendar year 2025. Through Flash Ventures, we and Kioxia collaborate in the development and manufacture of flash-based memory wafers using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by each of the Flash Ventures entities. We co-develop flash technologies (including process technology and memory design) with Kioxia for Flash Ventures’ use. We hold a 49.9% ownership position in each of the Flash Ventures entities. We jointly control with Kioxia the operations of Flash Ventures, and we believe our participation in Flash Ventures helps us reduce product costs, increases our ability to control the quality of our products and speeds delivery of our products to our customers.\nKioxia owns the facilities and provides wafer manufacturing services to Flash Ventures at cost using manufacturing equipment owned or leased by Flash Ventures and process technologies co-owned or contributed by us and Kioxia. We and Kioxia are entitled to purchase a share of Flash Ventures’ output, which generally equals 50% each. The price for which we and Kioxia pay Flash Ventures for flash memory wafers is cost plus a small markup. We are obligated to pay for variable costs incurred in producing our share of Flash Ventures’ flash-based memory wafer supply, based on a rolling forecast. In addition, we are obligated to pay for half of Flash Ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output we choose to purchase.\nThe agreements governing the operations of the Flash Ventures entities also set out a framework for any investment by the joint venture partners in flash manufacturing capacity. We have jointly invested, and intend to continue to jointly invest, with Kioxia in the manufacturing equipment needed to support Flash Ventures’ flash manufacturing operations. In addition, we are obligated to fund 49.9% to 50.0% of each Flash Ventures entity’s capital investments to the extent that the Flash Ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our business ventures with Kioxia, see Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales and Distribution\nWe sell our products to computer manufacturers and OEMs, cloud service providers, resellers, distributors and retailers throughout the world. We maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Our international sales, which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies but do not include sales to U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies, represented\n72%,\n69% and 71% of our net revenue for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales to international customers are subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations, including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations. For a discussion of such risks, see Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n8\nWe perform our marketing and advertising functions both internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and end-user markets. We also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and by providing information and support through our website. In accordance with standard storage industry practice, we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures. We also provide distributors, resellers and OEMs with other sales incentive programs.\nFor each of 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nno single customer\naccounted for 10% or more of our net revenue.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters as a result of increased customer spending. Seasonality is also impacted by cyclicality in the industry and macroeconomic conditions. For a discussion of associated risks, see Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nService and Warranty\nWe generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of sale depending on the type of product, with a small number of products having a warranty ranging up to ten years or more. Our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement. We have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing, processing or recertification of returned products for our customers. For additional information regarding our service and warranty policy, see Part II, Item 8, Note 1,\nOrganization and Basis of Presentation,\nand Note 4,\nSupplemental Financial Statement Data,\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur People\nOur people strategy supports our purpose of being the world’s iconic data storage company through thoughtful offerings and inclusive practices that aim to attract, develop and engage talent. At the end of 2024, we employed approximately 51,000 people worldwide. Our diverse team spans 36 countries with approximately 85% of our employees in Asia Pacific, 13% in the Americas and 2% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nInclusion\nTo attract and retain the best talent, we strive to cultivate an inclusive environment where every individual can thrive through a sense of belonging, respect and contribution.\nOur Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) are designed to promote an inclusive culture that embraces the uniqueness of our employees. We have eight ERGs with multiple global chapters that focus on women, LGBTQ+, racial and ethnic minorities, military veterans and people with disabilities. In support of creating an inclusive environment, we also launched unconscious bias education to all professional and technical employees in 2024.\nWe have multiple initiatives that focus on attracting talent and fostering our diverse representation across our global workforce, including diversity in personal characteristics, experience, skills, gender, race, ethnicity and membership in underrepresented communities. We continue to foster early talent through our intern and new college graduate recruitment programs, and in 2024, we converted nearly half of our global intern population to employees. In 2024, we launched our first-ever U.S. Department of Labor approved apprenticeship program, serving as a career pathway for veterans and other underserved populations. Furthermore, to minimize bias from the hiring process, we adopted data-driven tools as well as provided in-person and on-demand unconscious bias trainings to our recruiters and hiring managers.\nAs of June 28, 2024, women represented 26% of our management positions and 24% of our technical staff. Additionally, members of Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino and other racially or ethnically diverse communities, represented 60% of our U.S. management positions. For additional details about our workforce, we encourage you to review our Sustainability Report, published annually and posted on our corporate website. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n9\nTalent Development and Engagement\nWe believe in supporting our people through learning and development opportunities and our pay for performance philosophy. To help our employees reach their full potential, we aim to cultivate an environment that encourages learning, development and career growth. Our performance framework includes developing goals collaboratively through transparent and actionable feedback in regular check-ins and performance designations. Our new on-demand learning management system, launched in 2024, offers learning activities and tools to help employees chart their career journey and track their progress. To give employees the skills they need to lead, we offer learning through virtual fireside chats with external speakers and through our flagship program Leader Essentials, which received the bronze medal from the Brandon Hall Group HCM Excellence Awards for Leadership Development in 2024. We also provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities to our factory employees through on-the-job training, technical classes, workshops and partnerships with universities and colleges.\nWe believe ongoing engagement is key to retention, and we prioritize that in many ways. We believe that listening is crucial to identifying opportunities to strengthen employee engagement and influence our overall strategy. Our latest survey completed in 2024 had a participation rate of nearly 90%. The survey results indicated that for our professional/technical employees, the company excels in areas of manager satisfaction, prioritization of work and sense of purpose. Our factory employees indicated that sense of purpose, company prospects and feeling of belonging were the top areas of strengths. We also engage employees by taking action to promote and ground them in our core values and beliefs, and to support our commitment to conducting business in an ethical way. In 2024, we were named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute for the sixth consecutive year. Our employees also regularly participate in philanthropy to support the communities in which they work and live. In 2024, more than half of our employees gave their time to participate in company-sponsored volunteer events.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe believe that recognition is crucial for retaining and motivating our employees, and we are committed to rewarding performance with competitive compensation consisting of base salary and short-term and long-term incentives. We also offer a global recognition program to celebrate the contributions of employees who bring to life our core values – to think big, create possibility, make it happen and do it together.\nWe invest in the physical, mental and financial well-being of our people through a dynamic and differentiated Total Rewards program that aligns to our culture and values. We provide competitive benefits (which vary by country/region), including health coverage, life and disability insurance, retirement plans, paid time off, employee assistance program and employee stock purchase plan. In 2024, we continued our multi-year journey to modernize our benefits portfolio to offer more choices to meet the unique needs of our diverse employees.\nWe benchmark our compensation and benefits programs annually using market data from reputable third-party consultants. We also conduct internal focus groups and employee surveys to inform programs and identify opportunities. To ensure that our pay practices are fair and equitable, we conduct an annual pay equity assessment to promote equal pay for equal work regardless of gender. This review analyzes current pay considering various non-discriminatory factors, such as seniority, experience, skills, performance, location, track and hiring and promotion dates. We use the results to make pay adjustments as needed. In 2024, our assessment covered 100% of our global employee population, and we furthered our pay equity efforts by engaging in a living wage analysis.\nHealth and Safety\nWe are committed to creating a safe work environment everywhere we operate. We provide extensive health and safety resources and training to all of our employees, especially those who work in our manufacturing and operations. We use an integrated management system to manage health and safety standards at our manufacturing facilities.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, the environment, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety and taxes, could have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position and overall business in subsequent periods. See Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\nfor a discussion of these potential impacts.\n10\nCorporate Responsibility and Sustainability\nWe believe responsible and sustainable business practices support our long-term success.

    "text": "Our business can be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties, any of which could cause material harm to our actual operating results and financial condition. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but represent risks that we believe are material to us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also negatively affect our business.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nAdverse global or regional conditions could harm our business.\nA large portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations, and many of our products and components are produced overseas. As a result, our business depends significantly on global and regional conditions. Adverse changes in global or regional economic and social conditions, including, but not limited to, volatility in the financial markets, reduced access to credit, recession, inflation, rising interest rates, slower growth in certain geographic regions, political uncertainty, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, terrorism, other macroeconomic factors and new or changed regulations, could significantly harm demand for our products, increase credit and collectability risks, result in revenue reductions, reduce profitability as a result of underutilization of our assets, cause us to change our business practices, increase manufacturing and operating costs or result in impairment charges or other expenses.\nOur revenue growth is significantly dependent on the growth of international markets, and we may face challenges in international sales markets. We are also subject to risks that could harm our business associated with our global manufacturing operations, global sales efforts and our utilization of contract manufacturers, including: the need to obtain governmental approvals and compliance with evolving foreign regulations; the need to comply with regulations on international business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, the anti-bribery laws of other countries and rules regarding conflict minerals; exchange, currency and tax controls and reallocations; weaker protection of IP rights; policies and financial incentives by governments in China, the United States, and countries in Europe and Asia designed to reduce dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturing capabilities; trade restrictions, such as export controls, export bans, import restrictions, embargoes, sanctions, license and certification requirements (including semiconductor, encryption and other technology), tariffs and complex customs regulations; and difficulties in managing international operations, including appropriate internal controls.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers who provide critical services, materials or components, and a disruption in our supply chain could negatively affect our business.\nWe depend on an external supply base for technologies, software (including firmware), preamps, controllers, dynamic random-access memory, components, equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing. We also depend on suppliers for a portion of our wafer testing, chip assembly, product assembly and product testing, and on service suppliers for providing technical support for our products. In addition, we use logistics partners to manage our worldwide just-in-time hubs and distribution centers and to meet our freight needs. Many of the components and much of the equipment we acquire must be specifically designed for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our products, and are only available from a limited number of suppliers, some of whom are our sole-source suppliers. We therefore depend on these suppliers to meet our business needs including dedicating adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products.\nOur suppliers have in the past been, and may in the future be, unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, including as a result of events outside of their control such as trade restrictions (including tariffs, quotas and embargoes), geopolitical conflicts, terrorism, public health crises or natural disasters. If we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers or qualify and engage additional suppliers, or if we cannot purchase materials at a reasonable price, we may not be able to meet demand for our products. Trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas and embargoes, demand from other high-volume industries for materials or components used in our products, disruptions in supplier relationships or shortages in other components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in increased costs to us or decreased demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business. Delays, shortages or cost increases experienced by our suppliers in developing or sourcing materials and components for use in our products or incompatibility or quality issues relating to our products, could also harm our business.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with some of our existing suppliers, nor do we always have guaranteed manufacturing capacity with our suppliers, so we cannot guarantee that they will devote sufficient resources or capacity to manufacturing our\n12\nproducts. Any significant problems that occur at our suppliers could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems. When we do have contractual commitments with suppliers in an effort to stabilize the supply of our components, those commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components or make significant cash advances to the supplier and may not result in a satisfactory supply of our components. We have cancelled or deferred, and may continue to cancel or defer, outstanding purchase commitments with certain suppliers due to changes in actual and forecasted demand, which has resulted, and may continue to result in fees, penalties and other associated charges. Such cancellations or deferments can also negatively impact our relationships with certain suppliers or lead to a decline in the financial performance of certain suppliers, each of which could result in even more limited availability of components needed for our products.\nIn addition, our supply base has experienced industry consolidation. Our suppliers may be acquired by our competitors, decide to exit the industry or redirect their investments and increase costs to us. In addition, some of our suppliers have experienced a decline in financial performance, including as a result of cancelled or deferred purchase commitments. Where we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier, the risk of supplier loss due to industry consolidation or a decline in financial performance is increased. Some of our suppliers may also be competitors in other areas of our business, which could lead to difficulties in price negotiations or meeting our supply requirements.\nOur operations, and those of certain of our suppliers and customers, are subject to substantial risk of damage or disruption.\nWe conduct our operations at large, high-volume, purpose-built facilities in California and throughout Asia. The facilities of many of our customers, our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations throughout Asia and elsewhere. If a fire (including a climate change-related fire), flood, earthquake, tsunami or other natural disaster, condition or event such as a power outage, contamination event, terrorist attack, cybersecurity incident, physical security breach, political instability, civil unrest, localized labor unrest or other employment issues or a health epidemic negatively affects any of these facilities, it would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and source components and would harm our business. Possible impacts include work and equipment stoppages and damage to or closure of our facilities, or those of our suppliers or customers, for an indefinite period of time. Climate change has in the past and is expected to continue to increase the incidence and severity of certain natural disasters, including wildfires and adverse weather events. In addition, the geographic concentration of our manufacturing sites could exacerbate the negative impacts resulting from any of these problems.\nWe may incur losses beyond the limits of, or outside the scope of, the coverage of our insurance policies. There can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to maintain existing insurance coverage or that premiums will not increase substantially. Due to market availability, pricing or other reasons, we may elect not to purchase insurance coverage or to purchase only limited coverage. We maintain limited insurance coverage and, in some cases, no coverage at all, for natural disasters and damage to our facilities, as these types of insurance are sometimes not available or available only at a prohibitive cost. Climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of certain types of insurance by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of certain natural disasters. We depend upon Kioxia to obtain and maintain sufficient property, business interruption and other insurance for Flash Ventures. If Kioxia fails to do so, we could suffer significant unreimbursable losses, and such failure could also cause Flash Ventures to breach various financing covenants.\nPublic health crises have had, and could in the future have, a negative effect on our business.\nPublic health crises have in the past negatively impacted, and may in the future negatively impact, our workforce and operations, as well as those of our strategic partners, customers, suppliers and logistics providers. The impacts we experienced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic included temporary closures of certain manufacturing facilities; under-absorbed overhead; increased logistics, component and other costs; decreased demand for our products; and manufacturing challenges. Future outbreaks of infectious disease or other public health crises may have similar impacts.\nThe effects of public health crises are uncertain and difficult to predict, but may also include disruptions to our supply chain, our operations or those of our strategic partners, customers or suppliers; deterioration of worldwide credit markets, which may limit our ability or increase our cost to obtain external financing and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable; volatility in financial markets, which may be extreme and could harm our ability to access the financial markets on acceptable terms or at all; increased data security and technology risks related to increased remote work; and reduced productivity or other disruptions of our operations. The degree to which any future public health crises ultimately impact our business will depend on many factors beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\n13\nThe loss of our key management, staff and skilled employees; the inability to hire and develop new employees; or decisions to realign our business could negatively impact our business prospects.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our talent. Changes in our key management team may result in loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge, departure of other key employees, disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods. Global competition for skilled employees in the technology industry is intense, and our business success is increasingly dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain top talent, implement succession plans for key management and staff and replace aging skilled employees. Changes in immigration policies may also impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. Additionally, uncertainty about business realignment actions or the structure and organization of our business as a result of our ongoing separation of our HDD and Flash business units into two independent public companies could negatively impact our ability to recruit and retain key staff and skilled employees. We have and may continue to put retention arrangements in place for key employees to address the uncertainty about our business separation. When these retention payments are earned, we may suffer further attrition.\nOur ability to hire and retain employees also depends on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and to fund competitive compensation and benefits, each of which contribute to being viewed as an employer of choice. Additionally, because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is linked to the performance of our business, we may be at a competitive disadvantage for hiring and retaining talent when our operating results are negatively impacted. If we are unable to hire and retain key talent, our operating results would likely be harmed.\nThe compromise, damage or interruption of our technology infrastructure, information systems or products by cybersecurity incidents, data security breaches, other security problems, design defects, information system failures or other events could have a material negative impact on our business.\nWe experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and information systems and, as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained in the past, and may obtain in the future, access to our computer systems and networks, including cloud-based platforms. These incidents have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, disruption to parts of our business operations and result in various investigation, recovery and remediation expenses. In addition, the technology infrastructure and information systems of some of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers and partners have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such incidents. Cybersecurity incidents can be caused by ransomware, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including the covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, and the use of techniques or processes that change frequently, may be disguised or difficult to detect, or are designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, and may continue undetected for an extended period of time. Cybersecurity incidents have in the past resulted from, and may in the future result from, social engineering or impersonation of authorized users, and may also result from efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses, intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges, intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage. In some instances, efforts to correct vulnerabilities or prevent incidents have in the past, and may in the future, reduce the functionality or performance of our information systems and networks, which could negatively impact our business. We believe malicious cybersecurity acts are increasing in number and that cybersecurity threat actors are increasingly organized and well-financed or supported by state actors, and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only infiltrate information systems, but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents.\nOur products are also targets for malicious cybersecurity acts, including those products utilized in cloud-based environments as well as our cloud service offerings. Our cloud services have in the past and may in the future be taken offline as a result of or in order to prevent or mitigate cybersecurity incidents. While some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect third-party content or user-generated data stored on our products, these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised, breached or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers, which could harm our business by exposing us to litigation and indemnification claims and hurting our reputation.\nWhen efforts to breach our infrastructure, information systems or products are successful or we are unable to protect against such attacks, we have in the past suffered, and could in the future suffer, interruptions, delays or cessation of operations of our information systems, and loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, IP, or sensitive or personal information. We may also experience disruptions or outages of our information systems due to internal or third-party mistakes or technical errors, including due to software updates, which could disrupt our business operations. Compromises of our infrastructure, information systems or products could also cause our customers and other affected third parties to suffer loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, IP, or sensitive or personal information, and could harm our relationships\n14\nwith customers and other third parties and subject us to liability. As a result of actual or perceived cybersecurity incidents or other information system disruptions, we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience additional costs, notification requirements, civil and administrative fines and penalties, indemnification claims, litigation or damage to our brand and reputation. All of these consequences could harm our reputation and our business and materially and negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks related to product defects, which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty, litigation or indemnification claims that exceed our expectations or estimates.\nWe warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years. We test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means. However, our testing may fail to reveal defects in our products that may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market. In addition, our products may be used in a manner that is not intended or anticipated by us, resulting in potential liability. Accordingly, there is a risk that product defects will occur, including as a result of third-party components or applications that we incorporate in our products, which could require a product recall. Product recalls can be expensive to implement. As part of a product recall, we may be required or choose to replace the defective product. Moreover, there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement. If an epidemic failure occurs, we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure. In addition, product defects, product recalls or epidemic failures may cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships, lost revenue, indemnification for a recall of our customers’ products, warranty claims, litigation or loss of market share with our customers, including our OEM and original design manufacturer (“ODM”) customers. Our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nOur standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse, improper installation, alteration, accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us. We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. We may incur additional expenses if our warranty provisions do not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products, whether as a result of a product recall, epidemic failure or otherwise. If these additional expenses are significant, they could harm our business.\nBUSINESS AND STRATEGIC RISKS\nThe proposed separation of our HDD and Flash business units into two independent public companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all.\nOn October 30, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors had completed its review of potential strategic alternatives and had unanimously approved pursuing a plan to separate the Flash business unit from our remaining HDD business (the “Separation”). The Separation is intended to be structured in a tax-free manner and we continue to drive towards completing the work required to separate the businesses by the end of calendar year 2024. No assurance can be given as to whether the Separation will occur, when any such transaction will be approved or when any separation may be completed. Furthermore, while we are working toward the Separation, the specific assets, liabilities and entities to be separated are still being finalized and may change. We may determine to abandon any efforts with respect to the Separation at any time for any reason.\nThe form or other terms of the Separation may change over time, including with respect to the scope of the businesses to be separated or retained by us. The final determination to separate is subject to Board approval, the execution of definitive documentation, receipt of opinions or rulings as to the tax-free nature of the Separation and satisfaction of customary conditions, including the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the SEC, the completion of audited financial statements and the availability of financing. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the intended tax treatment will be achieved or that shareholders will not incur substantial tax liabilities in connection with the Separation. The failure to satisfy any of these conditions could delay the completion of the Separation for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all.\nVarious factors, including changes in the competitive conditions of our markets, changes in financial markets and economic conditions, failure to obtain any third party consents that may be required for the Separation, delays in obtaining tax opinions or rulings, material or unanticipated tax liability for our shareholders, us, and/or the Flash business unit, and other challenges in executing the separation of the two businesses, could delay or prevent the completion of the Separation or cause it to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected.\n15\nFurther, our Board of Directors could decide, either because of a failure of conditions or because of market or other factors, to abandon the Separation.\nOur review of the Separation has and will continue to involve significant time, expense and resources and could disrupt or adversely affect our business.\nExecuting the Separation has required and will continue to require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees and may divert their attention from operating and growing our business in ways that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our employees may also be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with the separated companies, and customers or suppliers could delay or defer decisions or may end their relationships with us.\nIn addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur expenses in connection with our strategic review and the consideration of the Separation and expect that the process of reviewing the Separation and executing the Separation, if any, will be time-consuming and involve significant additional costs and expenses, which may not yield a benefit if the Separation is not completed. If pursued, we will also incur ongoing costs and dis-synergies in connection with, or as a result of, the Separation and related restructuring transactions, including costs of operating as independent, publicly traded companies that the two businesses will no longer be able to share.\nAny of the above factors could cause the Separation (or the failure to execute the Separation) to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock and/or other securities.\nThe Separation may not achieve the anticipated benefits and could expose us to new risks, including with respect to our existing indebtedness and future capital structure.\nWe may not realize any strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from the Separation. We cannot predict with certainty if or when anticipated benefits will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved. If the Separation is completed, our operational and financial profile (including our capital structure) will change and we will face new risks. If the Separation is completed, we will be a smaller and less-diversified company and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions. While we believe that the Separation will position each company to better unlock its full standalone long-term potential, we cannot assure you that following the Separation we will be successful. Further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the shares of the two resulting companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the Separation not occurred.\nIn addition, following the completion of the Separation or any other disposition of our Flash business unit, we will not be able to rely on the earnings, assets or cash flow of the Flash business unit, and that business will not provide funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements. As a result, our ability to service our debt may be adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade after the Separation or the effect of the Separation on the trading prices of our common stock.\nThe Separation will be subject to numerous conditions, including the availability of financing. We have not obtained any financing with respect to the Separation transaction, including any new financing for the remaining business and the terms of any such arrangements may be more burdensome or costly than the terms of our current indebtedness or we may not be able to obtain credit on attractive terms and price. Furthermore, the Separation may leave us with higher leverage and may also cause us to violate provisions of contracts or breach covenants in our existing indebtedness if such contracts or indebtedness are not replaced, repaid or refinanced or waivers are not obtained prior to the Separation. For example, our credit facilities contain specific restrictions on any disposal of our Flash business unit. In addition, we cannot assure you that a holder of our outstanding senior notes will not argue that the Separation constitutes a change of control and try to require us to repurchase its notes as a result of the Separation.\nWe rely substantially on strategic relationships with various partners, including Kioxia, which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business.\nWe have entered into and expect to continue to enter into strategic relationships with various partners for product development, manufacturing, sales growth and the supply of technologies, components, equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing, including our business ventures with Kioxia. We depend on Flash Ventures for the\n16\ndevelopment and manufacture of flash-based memory. Our strategic relationships, including Flash Ventures, are subject to various risks that could harm the value of our investments, our revenue and costs, our future rate of spending, our technology plans and our future growth opportunities. For example, while Flash Ventures is operating, certain of our agreements with Kioxia preclude us from manufacturing flash-based memory ourselves except to the extent that we acquire any manufacturing capacity of a Flash Ventures entity as a result of that entity’s dissolution, termination or acquisition by us. This could also impair our ability to consolidate with other industry participants who manufacture flash-based memory.\nSubstantially all of our flash-based memory is obtained from Flash Ventures, which limits our ability to respond to market demand and supply changes and makes our financial results particularly susceptible to variations from our forecasts and expectations. For example, we are contractually obligated to pay for 50% of the fixed costs of Flash Ventures regardless of whether we order any flash-based memory, and our orders placed with Flash Ventures on a three-month rolling basis are binding. As a result, a failure to accurately forecast supply and demand could cause us to over-invest or under-invest in inventory, technology transitions or the expansion of Flash Ventures’ capacity. Over-investment by us or our competitors can result in excess supply and lead to significant decreases in our product prices, significant excess, obsolete inventory or inventory write-downs or underutilization charges, and the potential impairment of our investments in Flash Ventures. For example, for our Flash business, in 2024 and 2023, we incurred $252 million and $296 million of charges for unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs as a result of the reduced utilization of our manufacturing capacity, respectively. Additionally, in 2024, we recorded $108 million of charges to write-down our inventory as a result of decreases in market pricing. These charges were attributable to a significant imbalance of supply and demand and our actions taken in response thereto. On the other hand, if we under-invest in Flash Ventures, or otherwise grow or transition Flash Ventures’ capacity too slowly, we may not have enough supply of flash-based memory, or the right type of flash-based memory, to meet demand on a timely and cost effective basis, and we may lose opportunities for revenue, gross margin and market share as a result. If our supply is limited, we might make strategic decisions with respect to the allocation of our supply among our products and customers, which could result in less favorable gross margins or damage customer relationships.\nOur control over the operations of our business ventures may be limited, and our interests could diverge from our strategic partners’ interests regarding ongoing and future activities. For example, each Flash Ventures entity operates for a defined period of time agreed upon between the joint venture partners. Although we and Kioxia have agreed to extend that period of time for each Flash Ventures entity since the start of Flash Ventures, there is a risk that we and Kioxia will be unable to agree on a further extension of one or more of the Flash Ventures entities in the future. Additionally, under the Flash Ventures agreements, we cannot unilaterally direct most of Flash Ventures’ activities, and we have limited ability to source or fabricate flash outside of Flash Ventures. Flash Ventures requires significant investments by both Kioxia and us for technology transitions and capacity expansions, and our business could be harmed if our technology roadmap and investment plans are not sufficiently aligned with Kioxia’s. Lack of alignment with Kioxia with respect to Flash Ventures could negatively impact our ability to react quickly to changes in the market, or to stay at the forefront of technological advancement. Misalignment could arise due to changes in Kioxia’s strategic priorities, management, ownership or access to capital, which have changed in recent years and could continue to change. Kioxia’s stakeholders may include, or have included in the past, competitors, customers, a private equity firm, government entities or public stockholders. Kioxia’s management changes, ownership and capital structure could lead to delays in decision-making, disputes or changes in strategic direction that could negatively impact the strategic partnership, and therefore us. There may exist conflicts of interest between Kioxia’s stakeholders and Flash Ventures or us with respect to, among other things, protecting and growing Flash Ventures’ business, IP and competitively sensitive confidential information.\nTogether with Kioxia, we fund a portion of the investments required for Flash Ventures through lease financings. Continued availability of lease financings for Flash Ventures is not guaranteed and could be limited by several factors, including availability of tools qualified for leasing, investor capacity and risk allocation policies, our or Kioxia’s financial performance and changes to our or Kioxia’s business, ownership or corporate structure. To the extent that lease financings are not accessible on favorable terms or at all, more cash would be required to fund investments.\nOur strategic relationships are subject to additional risks that could harm our business, including, but not limited to, the following: failure by our strategic partners to comply with applicable laws or employ effective internal controls; difficulties and delays in product and technology development at, ramping production at, and transferring technology to, our strategic partners; declining financial performance of our strategic partners, including failure by our strategic partners to timely fund capital investments with us or otherwise meet their commitments, including the payment of amounts owed to us or third parties when due; losing the rights to, or ability to independently manufacture, certain technology or products being developed or manufactured by strategic partners, including as a result of any of them being acquired by another company, filing for bankruptcy or experiencing financial or other losses; a bankruptcy event involving a strategic partner, which could result in\n17\nstructural changes to or termination of the strategic partnership; and changes in tax or regulatory requirements, which may necessitate changes to the agreements governing our strategic partnerships.\nWe participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to declining average selling prices (“ASPs”), volatile demand, rapid technological change and industry consolidation, as well as lengthy product qualifications, all of which can negatively impact our business.\nDemand for our devices, software and solutions, which we refer to in this Item 1A as our “products”, depends in large part on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems. The demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period. Demand for and prices of our products are influenced by, among other factors, the actual and projected growth of data to be stored, the balance between supply and demand in the storage market, including the effects of new fab capacity, macroeconomic factors, business conditions, the emergence or growth of new or existing technologies (including AI), technology transitions and other actions taken by us or our competitors. The storage market has recently experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of excess capacity leading to liquidation of excess inventories, inventory write-downs, significant reductions in ASPs and negative impacts on our revenue and gross margins and volatile product life cycles that harm our ability to recover the cost of product development.\nFurther, our ASPs and gross margins tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales to lower priced products. We have faced declining gross margins in the past, and may face potential gross margin pressures in the future, resulting from our ASPs declining more rapidly than our cost of revenue. Rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence and write-downs. Finally, the data storage industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years, which could enhance the resources and lower the cost structure of some competitors. These factors could result in a substantial decrease in our market share and harm our business.\nAs we compete in new product areas, the overall complexity of our business may increase and may result in increases in R&D expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability, technology enhancements and go-to-market capability. We must also qualify our products with customers through potentially lengthy testing processes with uncertain results. Some of our competitors offer products that we do not offer, which may allow them to win sales from us, and some of our customers may be developing storage solutions internally, which may reduce their demand for our products. We expect that competition will continue to be intense, and our competitors may be able to gain a product offering or cost structure advantage over us, which would harm our business. Further, our competitors may utilize pricing strategies, including offering products at prices at or below cost, that we may be unable to competitively match. We may also have difficulty effectively competing with manufacturers benefiting from governmental investments and may be subject to increased complexity and reduced efficiency in our supply chain as a result of governmental efforts to promote domestic semiconductor industries in various jurisdictions.\nIf we do not properly manage technology transitions and product development and introduction, our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected.\nThe markets for our products continuously undergo technology transitions that can impact our product roadmaps and that we must anticipate in order to adapt our existing products or develop new products effectively. If we fail to adapt to or implement new technologies, if we fail to quickly and cost-effectively develop new products that meet the specifications and requirements intended or desired by our customers or if technology transitions negatively impact our existing product roadmaps, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, the success of our technology transitions and product development depends on a number of other factors, including R&D expenses and results; difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp; market acceptance/qualification; effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; the vertical integration of some of our products, which may result in more capital expenditures and greater fixed costs than if we were not vertically integrated; our ability to cost effectively respond to customer requests for new products or features (including requests for more efficient and efficiently-produced products with reduced environmental impacts) and software associated with our products; our ability to increase our software development capability; and the effectiveness of our go-to-market capability in selling new products.\nMoving to new technologies and products may require us to align to, and build, a new supply base. Our success in new product areas may depend on our ability to enter into favorable supply agreements. In addition, if our customers choose to delay transition to new technologies, if demand for the products that we develop is lower than expected or if the supporting\n18\ntechnologies to implement these new technologies are not available, we may be unable to achieve the cost structure required to support our profit objectives or may be unable to grow or maintain our market position.\nAdditionally, new technologies could impact demand for our products in unforeseen or unexpected ways and new products could substitute for our current products and make them obsolete, each of which would harm our business. We also develop products to meet certain industry and technical standards, which may change and cause us to incur substantial costs as we adapt to new standards or invest in different manufacturing processes to remain competitive.\nWe experience sales seasonality and cyclicality, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate. In addition, accurately forecasting demand has become more difficult, which could harm our business.\nSales of many of our products tend to be seasonal and subject to volatile and irregular supply-demand cycles. Changes in seasonal and cyclical supply and demand patterns have made it, and could continue to make it, more difficult for us to forecast demand. Changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns. For example, we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of each quarter. As a result of the above or other factors, our forecast of financial results for a given quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results.\nThe variety and volume of products we manufacture are based in part on accurately forecasting market and customer demand for our products, which are influenced by a wide variety of factors. As a result of the number and complexity of these factors, accurately forecasting demand has been and continues to be increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers. Further, for many of our OEM customers utilizing just-in-time inventory, we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements, which may prove to be inaccurate. In addition, because our products are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products, our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors. As forecasting demand becomes more difficult, the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases. This has caused, and may in the future cause, our forecasts to exceed actual market demand, resulting in periods of product oversupply, excess inventory, underutilization of manufacturing capacity and price decreases, which has impacted and could further impact our sales, ASPs and gross margin or require us to incur additional inventory write-downs or additional charges for unabsorbed manufacturing overhead, thereby negatively affecting our operating results and our financial condition. For example, in 2024 and 2023, we incurred $407 million and $497 million of charges for unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs as a result of the reduced utilization of our manufacturing capacity, respectively. Additionally, in 2024, we incurred $108 million of charges to write-down our inventory as a result of decreases in market pricing. These charges were attributable to a significant imbalance of supply and demand and our actions taken in response thereto. If market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity, then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs, possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands. In addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand. Such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory, potentially resulting in inventory write-downs, or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand.\nFailure to successfully execute on strategic initiatives including acquisitions, divestitures or cost saving measures may negatively impact our future results.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions and divestitures, and engage in cost saving measures. In order to successfully execute on strategic initiatives, we must continue to identify and successfully complete attractive transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees and integration of processes and systems. We may not be able to continue to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions. Even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions, we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner, or at all. There have been and may continue to be difficulties with implementing new systems and processes or with integrating systems and processes of companies with complex operations, which may result in inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies and may increase our vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks or the risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective.\nFailing to successfully integrate or realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition or divestiture may result in not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of the transaction. In addition, failing to achieve the financial model projections for an acquisition or changes in technology development and related roadmaps following an acquisition may result in the incurrence of impairment charges (including goodwill impairments or other asset write-downs) and other expenses, both of which could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition.\n19\nAcquisitions and investments may also result in the issuance of equity securities that may be dilutive to our stockholders as well as earn-out or other contingent consideration payments and the issuance of additional indebtedness that would put additional pressure on liquidity. Furthermore, we may agree to provide continuing service obligations or enter into other agreements in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals of our corporate transactions, and failure to satisfy these additional obligations could result in our failing to obtain regulatory approvals or the imposition of additional obligations on us, any of which could negatively affect our business. In addition, new legislation or additional regulations may affect or impair our ability to invest with or in certain other countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so, including investments in joint ventures, minority investments and outbound technology transfers to certain countries.\nCost saving measures, restructurings and divestitures may result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our manufacturing or other facilities. As a result of these actions, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge, disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods. These actions could also impact employee retention. In addition, we cannot be sure that these actions will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect, that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or consolidations or that we do not forego future business opportunities as a result of these actions.\nAcquisitions and alliance activities inherently involve other risks as well, including those associated with disruption to our business and the continued successful execution of our company strategy, goals and responsibilities; assimilation and integration of different business operations, corporate cultures, personnel, infrastructures and technologies or solutions acquired or licensed, while maintaining quality, and designing and implementing appropriate risk management measures; and the possibility of conflict with joint venture or alliance partners regarding strategic direction, prioritization of objectives and goals, governance matters or operations.\nLoss of revenue from a key customer, or consolidation among our customer base, could harm our operating results.\nHistorically, nearly one half of our total revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers. These customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands on product pricing, contractual terms and the environmental impact and attributes of our products, often resulting in the allocation of risk or increased costs to us as the supplier. Our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance. We have experienced and may in the future experience events such as the loss of a key customer, prohibition or restriction of sales to a key customer by law, regulation or other government action, reductions in sales to or orders by a key customer, customer requirements to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs or the acquisition of a key customer by one of our competitors. These events have impacted, and may in the future impact, our operating results and financial condition. Further, government authorities may implement laws or regulations or take other actions that could result in significant changes to the business or operating models of our customers. Such changes could negatively impact our operating results.\nAdditionally, if there is consolidation among our customer base, our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could negatively impact our profitability. Consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products, increased customer pressure on our prices, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders, each of which could harm our operating results.\nAlso, the storage ecosystem is constantly evolving, and our traditional customer base is changing. Fewer companies now hold greater market share for certain applications and services, such as cloud storage and computing platforms, mobile, social media, shopping and streaming media. As a result, the competitive landscape is changing, giving these companies increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could negatively impact our profitability. In addition, the changes in our evolving customer base create new selling and distribution patterns to which we must adapt. To remain competitive, we must respond to these changes by ensuring we have proper scale in this evolving market, as well as offer products that meet the technological requirements of this customer base at competitive pricing points. To the extent we are not successful in adequately responding to these changes, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nSales in the distribution channel and to the retail market are important to our business, and if we fail to respond to demand changes within these markets, or maintain and grow our applicable market share, our business could suffer.\nOur distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators and other resellers. We face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product. As a result of the shift to mobile devices, more computing devices are being delivered to the\n20\nmarket as complete systems, which could weaken the distribution market. If we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market, our business could suffer. Additionally, if the distribution market weakens as a result of technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference, or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel, our operating results would be negatively impacted. Negative changes in the creditworthiness or the ability to access credit, or the bankruptcy or shutdown of any of our significant retail or distribution partners would harm our revenue and our ability to collect outstanding receivable balances.\nA significant portion of our sales is also made through retailers. Our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple retail market channels. Particularly in the retail market, negative publicity, whether or not justified, or allegations of product or service quality issues, even if false or unfounded, could damage our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors. Further, changes to the retail environment, such as store closures caused by macroeconomic conditions or changing customer preferences, may reduce the demand for our products. If customers no longer maintain a preference for our product brands or if our retailers are not successful in selling our products, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nOur level of debt may negatively impact our liquidity, restrict our operations and ability to respond to business opportunities, and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nWe utilize debt financing in our capital structure and may incur additional debt, including under our revolving credit facility subject to customary conditions in our loan agreements. Our level of debt could have significant consequences, including limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes; imposing financial and other restrictive covenants on our operations, including minimum liquidity requirements and limitations on our ability to (i) declare or pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock; (ii) purchase assets, make investments, complete acquisitions, consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; (iii) enter into sale/leaseback transactions or certain transactions with affiliates; (iv) incur additional indebtedness; and (v) incur liens, making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures or take advantage of new opportunities to grow our business.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations, comply with our debt covenants and deleverage depends on our cash flows and financial performance, which are affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. The rate at which we will be able to or choose to deleverage is uncertain. Failure to meet our debt service obligations or comply with our debt covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. We may be unable to cure, or obtain a waiver of, an event of default or otherwise amend our debt agreements to prevent an event of default thereunder on terms acceptable to us or at all. In that event, the debt holders could accelerate the related debt, which may result in the cross-acceleration or cross-default of other debt, leases or other obligations. We also utilize convertible debt in our capital structure and as of June 28, 2024, $1.6 billion principal amount of our convertible notes were convertible at the option of the holder. As such, these convertible notes were classified as current debt as of that date. In the event that holders of our convertible debt exercise conversion rights, we will be required to settle the principal amount of any converted notes in cash. If we do not have sufficient funds available to repay indebtedness when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or upon conversion, we may be required to sell important strategic assets; refinance our existing debt; incur additional debt or issue common stock or other equity securities, which we may not be able to do on terms acceptable to us, in amounts sufficient to meet our needs or at all. Our inability to service our debt obligations or refinance our debt could harm our business. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness, the holder of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness. Refinancing our indebtedness may also require us to expense previous debt issuance costs or to incur new debt issuance costs.\nAs our bank debt contains a variable interest rate component based on our corporate credit ratings, a decline in our ratings has in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, increased interest rates and debt service obligations. In addition, our ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies as to our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future.\nWe also guarantee a significant amount of lease obligations of Flash Ventures owed to third parties. Flash Ventures sells to and leases back a portion of its equipment from a consortium of financial institutions. Most of the lease obligations are guaranteed 50% by us and 50% by Kioxia. Some of the lease obligations are guaranteed in full by us. The leases are subject to\n21\ncustomary covenants and cancellation events that relate to Flash Ventures and each of the guarantors. If a cancellation event were to occur, Flash Ventures would be required to negotiate a resolution with the other parties to the lease transactions to avoid cancellation and acceleration of the lease obligations. Such resolution could include, among other things, supplementary security to be supplied by us, increased interest rates or waiver fees. If a resolution is not reached, we may be required to pay all of the outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantees, which would significantly reduce our cash position and may force us to seek additional financing, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe may from time to time seek to further refinance our substantial indebtedness by issuing additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into common stock or grant the holder the right to purchase common stock, each of which may dilute our existing stockholders, reduce the value of our common stock, or both.\nTax matters may materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws in the United States, the European Union and around the globe have impacted and will continue to impact our effective worldwide tax rate, which may materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Further, the majority of countries in the G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) have agreed to adopt a two-pillar approach to taxation, which includes the implementation of a global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%, which, when effective, could materially increase our tax obligations in these countries. Due to the large scale of our U.S. and international business activities, many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities, including cash movements, could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the year incurred, requiring amortization in accordance with IRC Section 174. Depending on our operating results, this requirement could materially increase our effective tax rate and reduce our operating cash flows. Additionally, portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time, or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met. Although many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met, we may not be able to meet such conditions. If the tax holidays are not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, then our effective tax rate could increase in the future. Our effective tax rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to realize deferred tax assets. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income or if there is a change to the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a material increase in our effective tax rate.\nOur determination of our tax liability in the U.S. and other jurisdictions is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities. For example, as disclosed in Part I, Item 1, Note 13,\nIncome Tax Expense\n, of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for certain fiscal years. Although we believe our tax positions are properly supported, the final timing and resolution of any tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in litigation or the payment of significant amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions, which could result in an increase of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may harm our business.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results.\nBecause we manufacture and sell our products abroad, our revenue, cost of revenue, margins, operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreign-currency denominated. Conversely, there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially U.S. dollar denominated. Additionally, we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in U.S. dollars from non-U.S. based vendors. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other foreign currencies, some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin. In addition, our purchases of flash-based memory from Flash Ventures and our investment in Flash Ventures are denominated in Japanese yen. If the Japanese yen appreciates against the U.S. dollar, our cost of purchasing flash-based memory wafers and the cost to us of future capital funding of Flash Ventures would increase. When such events occur, they have had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on our business.\nPrices for our products are substantially U.S. dollar denominated, even when sold to customers that are located outside the U.S. Therefore, as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the U.S., fluctuations in currency exchanges\n22\nrates, most notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could negatively impact demand and revenue growth. In addition, currency variations may adversely affect, and from time to time have adversely affected, margins on sales of our products in countries outside the U.S.\nWe attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by, among other things, entering into short-term foreign exchange contracts. However, these contracts may not cover our full exposure, and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place. Thus, our decisions and hedging strategy with respect to currency risks may not be successful and may actually harm our operating results. Further, the ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions is based upon our available credit from such institutions and compliance with covenants and other restrictions. Operating losses, third party downgrades of our credit rating or instability in the worldwide financial markets could impact our ability to effectively manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk. Hedging also exposes us to the credit risk of our counterparty financial institutions.\nIncreases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and term extensions under existing contracts with customers with credit losses could result in an increase in our operating costs.\nSome of our OEM customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies, such as ODMs, that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our OEM customers. Because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct OEM customers, this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks. Our agreements with our OEM customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk. Additionally, as we attempt to expand our OEM and distribution channel sales into emerging economies, the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories, making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks. Our customers’ credit risk may also be exacerbated by an economic downturn or other adverse global or regional economic conditions. Any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks, or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer, especially in situations where there are term extensions under existing contracts with such customers, would increase our operating costs, which may negatively impact our operating results.\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and security of data, including personal data, and our failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties, significant legal liability, or loss of customers, loss of revenue and reputational harm.\nWe are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, security and privacy of third-party data, including data that relates to or identifies an individual person. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection and security. In many cases, these requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between our information systems and our subsidiaries, and among us, our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations. Our possession and use of third-party data, including personal data and employee data in conducting our business, subjects us to legal and regulatory obligations that require us to notify vendors, customers or employees or other parties with which we have commercial relations of a data security breach and to respond to regulatory inquiries and to enforcement proceedings. Managing these notifications, especially in large volumes, can lead to significant expenses, even with cybersecurity insurance coverage. Laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, security and privacy of third-party data change over time and new laws and regulations become effective from time to time. We are subject to notice and privacy statement requirements, as well as obligations to respond to requests to know and access personal information, correct personal information, delete personal information and say no to the sale of personal information. Global privacy and data protection legislation, enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and evolving, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We may also be subject to restrictions on cross-border data transfers and requirements for localized storage of data that could increase our compliance costs and risks and affect the ability of our global operations to coordinate activities and respond to customers and individuals. Compliance requirements or even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable laws may cause us to incur substantial costs, subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others, and cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or lead us to change our business practices.\n23\nWe are and may in the future be subject to state, federal and international legal and regulatory requirements, such as environmental, labor, health and safety, trade and public-company reporting and disclosure regulations, customers’ standards of corporate citizenship and industry and coalition standards, such as those established by the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”), and compliance with those regulations and requirements could cause an increase in our operating costs and failure to comply may harm our business.\nWe are subject to, and may become subject to, additional, state, federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental, labor, trade, health and safety practices and public-company reporting and disclosures requirements. These laws and regulations, particularly those applicable to our international operations, are or may be complex, extensive and subject to change. We will need to ensure that we and our suppliers, customers and partners timely comply with such laws and regulations, which may result in an increase in our operating costs. Legislation has been, and may in the future be, enacted in locations where we manufacture or sell our products, which could impair our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions or with certain customers and harm our operating results. In addition, climate change and financial reform legislation is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal, international or other regulatory responses in the near future, which could substantially increase the complexity of our public-company reporting and disclosure requirements and our compliance and operating costs. If we or our suppliers, customers or partners fail to timely comply with applicable legislation, certain customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes, fines or penalties, or legal liability and reputational damage, which could harm our business.\nIn connection with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations, as well as our compliance with industry and coalition environmental initiatives, such as those established by the RBA, the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers, and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business, we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics. In addition, if we or our suppliers, customers or partners were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct, we could be subject to governmental fines, liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand, which could cause our financial condition and operating results to suffer.\nOur aspirations, disclosures and actions related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.\nThere is an increased focus from investors, customers, associates, business partners and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters, and we announce initiatives and goals related to ESG matters from time to time, including renewable energy and net zero emissions commitments. These statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our ability to achieve any ESG objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control, including the availability and cost of alternative energy sources; the evolving regulatory and reporting requirements affecting ESG practices and disclosures; the locations and usage of our products and the implications on their greenhouse gas emissions; and the successful execution of our strategy. Our failure to accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals on a timely basis, or at all, and the potential added costs involved, could adversely affect our reputation; financial performance and growth; our ability to attract or retain talent; and our attractiveness as a business partner or supplier, and could expose us to increased litigation risk, as well as increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities.\nWe and certain of our officers are and may continue to be involved in litigation, investigations and governmental proceedings, which may be costly, may divert the efforts of our key personnel and could result in adverse court rulings, fines or penalties, which could materially harm our business.\nWe are and may continue to be involved in litigation, including antitrust and commercial matters, putative securities class action suits and other actions. We are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others. Some of the actions seek injunctive relief, including injunctions against the sale of our products, and substantial monetary damages, which if granted or awarded, could materially harm our business. We have in the past been and may in the future be the subject of inquiries, requests for information, investigations and actions by government and regulatory agencies regarding our businesses. Any such matters could result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations, financial condition or ability to conduct our business, including fines, penalties or restrictions on our business activities.\nLitigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation, investigation or governmental proceeding, we could be required to pay substantial damages, fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities, including the manufacture, use and sale of products. With or without merit, such matters may be complex, may extend for a protracted period of time, may be very expensive and the expense may be unpredictable. Litigation initiated by us could also result in counter-claims against us,\n24\nwhich could increase the costs associated with the litigation and result in our payment of damages or other judgments against us. In addition, litigation, investigations or governmental proceedings and any related publicity may divert the efforts and attention of some of our key personnel, affect demand for our products and harm the market prices of our securities.\nWe may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with litigation, investigations or governmental proceedings. These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things: the costs of defending lawsuits against these individuals; the cost of defending shareholder derivative suits; the cost of governmental, law enforcement or regulatory investigations or proceedings; civil or criminal fines and penalties; legal and other expenses; and expenses associated with the remedial measures, if any, which may be imposed.\nThe nature of our industry and its reliance on IP and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers, customers and partners to the risk of significant litigation.\nThe data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation. This includes litigation relating to patent and other IP rights, product liability claims and other types of litigation. We are frequently involved in disputes regarding patent and other IP rights, and we and our customers have in the past received, and we and our customers may in the future receive, communications from third parties asserting that certain of our products, processes or technologies infringe upon their patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other IP rights. Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they may be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. We may also receive claims of potential infringement if we attempt to license IP to others. IP risks increase when we enter into new markets where we have little or no IP protection as a deterrent against litigation. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of IP litigation increase the IP risks we face. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and have resulted in, and may in the future result in, adverse rulings or decisions. We may be subject to injunctions, enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may harm our business.\nIf we incorporate third-party technology into our products or if claims or actions are asserted against us for alleged infringement of the IP of others, we may be required to obtain a license or cross-license, modify our existing technology or design a new non-infringing technology. Such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly. We evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time. We may decide to settle a claim or action against us, which settlement could be costly. We may also be liable for past infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product. It could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement, treble damages. Any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results. In addition, our suppliers, customers and partners are subject to similar risks of litigation, and a material, adverse ruling against a supplier, customer or partner could negatively impact our business.\nMoreover, from time to time, we agree to indemnify certain of our suppliers and customers for alleged IP infringement. The scope of such indemnity varies but may include indemnification for direct and consequential damages and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. We may be engaged in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations. Third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies. A future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers may harm our business.\nOur reliance on IP and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key components of our business could be copied by competitors.\nOur success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary nature of our technology, including non-patentable IP such as our process technology. If we fail to protect our technology, IP or contract rights, our customers and others may seek to use our technology and IP without the payment of license fees and royalties, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly litigation. We primarily rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. There can be no assurance that our existing patents will continue to be held valid, if challenged, or that they will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us. It is also possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our proprietary technologies and processes, despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. If a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place, it may be difficult, expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. There are entities whom we believe may infringe our IP. Enforcement of our rights often requires litigation. If we bring a patent infringement\n25\naction and are not successful, our competitors may be able to use similar technology to compete with us. Moreover, the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. Also, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our IP to the same extent as do U.S. laws. In addition to patent protection of IP rights, we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential. We rely upon employee, consultant and vendor non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that these contracts and safeguards have not been and will not be breached, that we will be able to timely detect unauthorized use or transfer of our technology and IP, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Any of our registered or unregistered IP rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry, which could harm our operating results.\nMaintaining and strengthening our brands are important to maintaining and expanding our business, as well as to our ability to enter into new markets for our technologies, products and services. The success of our brands depends in part on the positive image that consumers have of our brands. We believe the popularity of our brands makes them a target of counterfeiting or imitation, with third parties attempting to pass off counterfeit products as our products. Any occurrence of counterfeiting, imitation or confusion with our brands could negatively affect our reputation and impair the value of our brands, which in turn could negatively impact sales and pricing of our branded products, our share and our gross margin, as well as increase our administrative costs related to brand protection and counterfeit detection and prosecution. Additionally, our ability to prevent unauthorized uses of our brands and technologies would be negatively impacted if our trademark registrations were successfully challenged or overturned in the jurisdictions where we do business. We also have trademark applications pending in a number of jurisdictions that may not ultimately be granted, or if granted, may be challenged or invalidated, in which case we would be unable to prevent unauthorized use of our brands and logos in such jurisdictions. We have not filed trademark registrations in all jurisdictions where our brands or logos may be used.\nThe exclusive forum provisions in our Bylaws could limit our stockholders' ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or the federal district court in the State of Delaware if the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction) is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (the “Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision”). Our Bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Federal Forum Provision”).\nThe Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the Federal Forum Provision is intended to apply to claims arising under the Securities Act and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act. The exclusive forum provisions in the Company’s Bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and, accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal courts. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nThe exclusive forum provisions in the Company’s Bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with the company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and other employees. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The court in the designated forum under our exclusive forum provisions may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to the Company than to our stockholders. Further, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find any of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find all or any part of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\n26"

    "text": "Risk Management and Strategy\nAt Western Digital, our management team is charged with managing risk and bringing to our Board of Directors’ attention all material risk exposures to our company. Our enterprise risk management (“ERM”) process is designed to facilitate the identification, assessment, management, reporting and monitoring of material risks our company may face over the short-term and long-term and assure regular communication with our Board of Directors and its committees regarding these risks. Through our ERM process, we have determined that the compromise, damage or interruption of our technology infrastructure, information systems or products by cybersecurity incidents is a key risk to our company that may have a material negative impact on our business. To help mitigate the potential impact of cybersecurity incidents on our business and protect against cybersecurity threats, we have established organizational structures, procedural measures and response plans that define roles and responsibilities related to cybersecurity risk management.\nWestern Digital’s Information Security organization addresses cybersecurity risks with a broad spectrum of technologies, controls, and processes that focus on mitigating these risks. Our cybersecurity strategy is designed to be dynamic and adaptive to combat the rapidly-evolving cybersecurity threat landscape and is influenced by commonly leveraged frameworks such as the NIST-CSF (National Institute of Standard and Technologies – CyberSecurity Framework). Our program includes, but is not limited to, advanced systems and network security protocols, electronic communications protections, vulnerability management programs, least-privilege access controls, third-party risk management procedures, workforce education and training exercises, and compliance programs.\nOur dedicated 24x7 Security Operations Center incorporates specialized systems and processes for handling security incidents into its regular work and operates a robust, modern security infrastructure with appropriate security sensors and event monitoring capabilities. Upon detection of a cybersecurity incident, the Security Operations Center determines the severity of the incident in accordance with a pre-established incident severity matrix, initiates the appropriate notification and escalation protocols and begins triage. Predefined severity tiers serve as a guide to match our response to each incident’s determined severity or risk level.\nAdditionally, we have established a Cyber Incident Response Plan that follows the structure of the Incident Handling Guide published by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (SP 800-61r2) and that serves as an operational guide for handling cybersecurity incidents at Western Digital. Our Cyber Incident Response Plan provides procedural and strategic guidance that is designed to be flexible enough to apply to a variety of different incidents, but also specific enough to provide guidelines for incident prevention, detection, analysis, escalation and notification, and containment, eradication and recovery.\nAs part of our ongoing information security program, Western Digital utilizes periodic independent third-party experts to conduct assessments of our program’s effectiveness. These experts are also leveraged to design and orchestrate tabletop exercises where multiple business functions and leadership levels must navigate complex incident scenarios to help determine our level of preparedness for various cybersecurity incidents.\nAs part of our business operations, Western Digital engages with a number of third parties, including but not limited to, online software service providers, vendors, consultants, and partners. Each of these third-parties must be cleared through a formal cybersecurity risk assessment process before being allowed to integrate with Western Digital’s information systems, access confidential data, or provide electronic services to members of our workforce. Additionally, further scrutiny is applied during the post-assessment onboarding process in order to fine-tune access rights to limit privileges to those necessary to enable the related service, resulting in a least-privilege level of access.\n27\nWestern Digital has in the past experienced cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees involving our technology infrastructure and information systems, including incidents in which unauthorized parties have obtained access to our information systems and networks. While these incidents have at times resulted in some disruptions to our business operations, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not believe that known risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incident, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, we can give no assurance that we have detected or protected against all such cybersecurity incidents or threats or that we will not experience such an incident in the future. Further details about the cybersecurity risks we face are described under “\nThe compromise, damage or interruption of our technology infrastructure, information systems or products by cybersecurity incidents, data security breaches, other security problems, design defects, information system failures or other events could have a material negative impact on our business”\nin Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors,\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nWestern Digital has implemented a governance framework related to cybersecurity that includes operational risk-mitigation practices and Board-level cybersecurity risk oversight.\nOur management team is charged with managing cybersecurity risk and identifying material cybersecurity risk exposures to our company and carries out this function primarily through our Information Security organization, which is led by our Chief Information Security Officer who has a master’s degree in computer science, over a decade of information security leadership, and thirty years of combined IT leadership experience. Additionally, our Cyber Incident Response Plan discussed above calls for the establishment of a management Impact Assessment Committee, which consists of key leadership representatives from the organization and is convened on an ad hoc basis to assess the detailed business impact of a cybersecurity incident. The Impact Assessment Committee is led by our Chief Information Security Officer and includes key representatives from the Company’s functional groups, including human resources, ethics and compliance, labor, privacy, internal audit, finance, communications, legal, risk and accounting. The Impact Assessment Committee receives updates and communications from the Security Operations Center on a fixed cadence determined by incident severity and follows our pre-established escalation framework to communicate with and include executive leadership, outside counsel and the Board of Directors, as appropriate. The Impact Assessment Committee works with the Company’s internal and external legal counsel to determine and facilitate appropriate communications with the Board of Directors.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the cybersecurity risk management process and exercises this risk oversight through both our full Board of Directors and its Audit Committee. Our Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit Committee the responsibility to oversee risks related to cybersecurity threats, and our Audit Committee Charter requires the Audit Committee to review and discuss with management the Company’s policies with respect to risk assessment and enterprise risk management and to review the risk exposure of the Company related to the Committee’s areas of responsibility, including with respect to cybersecurity. In carrying out this role, the Audit Committee meets with our Chief Information Security Officer regularly and receives at least quarterly reports on cybersecurity matters.\nAdditionally, at least annually, our Chief Audit Executive, who manages the day-to-day activities of our ERM program, reports to our Board of Directors on enterprise risk assessment under our ERM program, providing updates on key risks, status of mitigation efforts and residual risk trends, including an analysis of cybersecurity risks. Also at least annually, our Chief Information Security Officer reports to the full Board of Directors on cybersecurity matters related to or impacting our company and our business.\n28"

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results. You should read this information in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See also “Forward-Looking Statements” immediately prior to Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Company\nWe are a leading developer, manufacturer, and provider of data storage devices based on both HDD and NAND flash technologies. With a differentiated innovation engine driving advancements in storage and semiconductor technologies, our broad and ever-expanding portfolio delivers powerful HDD and Flash storage solutions for everyone from students, gamers, and home offices to the largest enterprises and public clouds to capture, preserve, access, and transform an ever-increasing diversity of data.\nOur broad portfolio of technology and products addresses our multiple end markets: “Cloud,” “Client” and “Consumer”. Cloud is comprised primarily of products for public or private cloud environments and enterprise customers. Through the Client end market, we provide our OEM and channel customers a broad array of high-performance HDD and Flash solutions across personal computer, mobile, gaming, automotive, virtual reality headsets, at-home entertainment, and industrial spaces. The Consumer end market is highlighted by our broad range of retail and other end-user products, which capitalize on the strength of our product brand recognition and vast points of presence around the world.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to June 30 and typically consists of 52 weeks. Approximately every five to six years, we report a 53-week fiscal year to align the fiscal year with the foregoing policy. Fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, which ended on June 28, 2024, June 30, 2023, and July 1, 2022, respectively, each comprised 52 weeks, with all quarters presented consisting of 13 weeks.\nKey Developments\nSeparation of Business Units\nOn October 30, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors had completed its strategic review of our business and, after evaluating a comprehensive range of alternatives, authorized us to pursue a plan to separate our HDD and Flash business units to create two independent, public companies. We believe the separation will better position each business unit to execute innovative technology and product development, capitalize on unique growth opportunities, extend respective leadership positions, and operate more efficiently with distinct capital structures. The completion of the planned separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by our Board of Directors. Significant effort is underway and extensive progress has been made with respect to the separation as we continue to drive towards completing the work required to separate the businesses by the end of calendar year 2024.\nOperational Update\nMacroeconomic factors such as inflation, higher interest rates and recession concerns had softened demand for our products in recent years, with certain customers reducing purchases as they adjusted their production levels and right-sized their inventories. As a result, we and our industry experienced a supply-demand imbalance, which resulted in reduced shipments and negatively impacted pricing. To adapt to these conditions, since the beginning of 2023, we have been implementing measures to reduce operating expenses, and to proactively manage supply and inventory to align with demand and improve our capital efficiency while continuing to deploy innovative products. These actions have enabled us to scale back on capital expenditures, consolidate production lines and reduce production bit growth. In 2024 and 2023, these actions have resulted in incremental charges for employee termination, asset impairment and other charges as well as charges for unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs in HDD and Flash as a result of the underutilization of facilities as we temporarily scaled back production.\nIn the latter half of 2024, we began to see an improvement in the supply and demand dynamic, leading to improved revenues. The increased demand resulted in improved pricing and gross margin across our segments and end markets compared to 2023. We anticipate that digital transformation, including AI data-cycle, will continue driving improved market conditions in the near- and long-term for data storage, encompassing both HDD and Flash technologies. Leveraging our expertise and innovation in both areas, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this improved market condition.\n34\nTax Resolution\nAs disclosed in previous periods, we had previously reached a final agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and received notices of deficiency with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and in February 2024, we also reached a final agreement for resolving the notices of proposed adjustments with respect to years 2013 through 2015. During the twelve months ended June 28, 2024, we made payments aggregating $524 million for tax and interest with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and have a remaining liability of $185 million as of June 28, 2024 related to all years from 2008 through 2015. We expect to pay any remaining balance with respect to this matter within the next twelve months. Additional information is provided in our discussion in our “Results of Operations –\nIncome Tax Expense,\n” and the “Short- and Long-term Liquidity –\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\n” section below, and in Part II, Item 8, Note 13,\nIncome Tax Expense\n, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing Activities\nOn November 3, 2023, we issued $1.60 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, which bear interest at an annual rate of 3.00% and mature on November 15, 2028, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted (the “2028 Convertible Notes”). We received net proceeds of approximately $1.56 billion after issuance costs. Contemporaneously with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we entered into individually negotiated transactions with certain holders of our existing 1.50% convertible senior notes due February 1, 2024 (the “2024 Convertible Notes”) to repurchase approximately $508 million aggregate principal amount of such notes at an immaterial discount using net proceeds from the offering of the 2028 Convertible Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we also used approximately $155 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of entering into capped call contracts with a cap price of approximately $70.26 to hedge the potential dilution impact of the conversion feature. On February 1, 2024, we used a portion of the remaining net proceeds from the offering of the 2028 Convertible Notes to settle the remaining 2024 Convertible Notes in accordance with their original terms for an aggregate cash principal payment of $592 million plus interest.\nDuring 2024, we drew and repaid $600 million principal amount (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan”) under a loan agreement we entered into in January 2023 and amended in June 2023. Proceeds from this loan were primarily used for payments on our tax liability to the IRS for the years 2008 through 2012.\nAdditional information regarding our indebtedness, including the principal repayment terms, interest rates, covenants and other key terms of our outstanding indebtedness, and additional information on the terms of our convertible preferred shares is included in Part II, Item 8, Note 7,\nDebt,\nof the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSee Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the risks we face as a result of macroeconomic conditions, and supply chain disruptions.\nAgreement to Sell a Majority Interest in a Subsidiary\nIn March 2024, our wholly-owned subsidiary, SanDisk China Limited (“SanDisk China”) entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement to sell 80% of its equity interest in SanDisk Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. (“SDSS”), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, to JCET Management Co., Ltd. (“JCET”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of JCET Group Co., Ltd., a Chinese publicly listed company, thereby forming a joint venture between SanDisk China and JCET (the “Transaction”). Closing of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, after which JCET will own 80% of the equity interest in SDSS, with SanDisk China owning the remaining 20%. Following the closing, we expect to enter into various ancillary agreements, including (i) a shareholders agreement governing the joint venture relationships from and after the closing; (ii) a supply agreement (“Supply Agreement”) with the joint venture to supply us with certain flash-based products currently produced by SDSS, which may include flash memory cards, embedded flash products, and flash components; and (iii) an intellectual property license agreement granting SDSS certain intellectual property rights on a royalty-free basis for use in manufacturing products on our behalf for the term of and pursuant to the Supply Agreement.\n35\nSale-Leaseback\nIn September 2023, we completed a sale and leaseback of our facility in Milpitas, California. We received net proceeds of $191 million in cash and recorded a gain of $85 million on the sale. We are leasing back the facility at an annual lease rate of $16 million for the first year, increasing by 3% per year thereafter through January 1, 2039. The lease includes three 5-year renewal options and one 4-year renewal option for the ability to extend through December 2057.\nAsset Impairment and Contract Termination Costs\nIn connection with the cost-saving actions described in “\nOperational Update\n” above, we reassessed our existing capacity development plans and made decisions during 2024 to cancel certain projects, including projects to expand capacity in our Penang, Malaysia facility. This resulted in a $146 million impairment of existing construction in progress and other assets and recognition of $34 million for certain contract termination costs during the year ended June 28, 2024.\n36\nResults of Operations\nSummary Comparison of 2024, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, selected summary information from our Consolidated Statements of Operations by dollars and percentage of net revenue\n(1)\n:\n(1)\nPercentage may not total due to rounding.\n37\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, a summary of our segment information:\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, summary information regarding our disaggregated revenue:\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue increased 6% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased exabytes sold, and improved supply-demand balance conditions in the second half of the year as described in the “Key Developments –\nOperational Update\n” section above and as discussed in more detail by business units below.\n38\nFlash revenue increased 10% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by a 21% increase in exabytes sold, partially offset by an 8% decline in ASPs per gigabyte. The increase in exabytes sold was primarily driven by improved demand from our OEM customers in our Client end market, and higher shipments of SSDs to our customers in our Consumer end market, partially offset by lower shipments in our Cloud end market. The decrease in ASPs per gigabyte was primarily driven by the supply-demand imbalance in the first half of the year, prior to the recent improvement in supply-demand conditions as described above.\nHDD revenue was relatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily reflecting an 8% increase in exabytes sold, largely offset by a 5% decline in ASPs per gigabyte. The increase in exabytes sold was driven by an increase in shipments of our high-capacity enterprise drives. The decline in ASPs per gigabyte was primarily due to a shift in the product mix to larger capacity drives.\nCloud revenue increased 2% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by a 12% increase in exabytes sold, largely offset by a 7% decline in ASPs per gigabyte. The increase in exabytes sold was driven by higher shipments of our high-capacity enterprise HDD products. The decline in ASPs per gigabyte was primarily due to a shift in product mix to larger capacity drives, and pricing pressure driven by the supply-demand imbalance in the first half of the year as described above. Client revenue increased 7% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by a 6% increase in exabytes sold and a 2% increase in ASPs per gigabyte. The increase in exabytes sold was driven by an increase in SSD shipments into PC applications, partially offset by lower HDD shipments. Consumer revenue increased 9% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by a 6% increase in ASPs per gigabyte and a 3% increase in exabytes sold. The increase in ASPs per gigabyte was primarily driven by a favorable shift in product mix. The increase in exabytes sold was primarily due to increased shipments across all Flash products, partially offset by lower shipments of HDD products.\nThe changes in net revenue by geography in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily reflected larger growth in Asia from OEMs in this region as their production levels increased as well as routine variations in the mix of business.\nFor 2024, 2023 and 2022, our top 10 customers accounted for 39%, 43% and 45%, respectively, of our net revenue. For each of 2024, 2023 and 2022, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue.\nConsistent with standard industry practice, we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, these programs represented 15%, 20% and 17%, respectively, of gross revenues. The amounts attributed to our sales incentive and marketing programs generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions, list pricing strategies, seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall availability of products. Changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nConsolidated gross profit increased $1.06 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was largely due to higher revenues from both Flash and HDD, cost reductions due to cost efficiencies achieved through improved manufacturing operations and cost-saving actions, and a more favorable product mix. The increase also reflected charges of approximately $407 million ($252 million in Flash and $155 million in HDD) for unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs as a result of the reduced utilization of our manufacturing capacity in 2024, compared to approximately $497 million of such costs ($296 million in Flash and $201 million in HDD) in 2023. In addition, we incurred charges of approximately $50 million in 2024 to write down Flash inventory as a result of the decreases in market pricing, compared to charges of $108 million of such costs in 2023. Consolidated gross margin increased 7.3 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023, with approximately 2 percentage points of the increase due to the lower net charges in the current period and the remainder driven by the same factors as noted above. Flash gross margin increased by 9.0 percentage points year over year, driven by improving pricing, cost reduction initiatives and a favorable shift in product mix. HDD gross margin increased by 5.7 percentage points year over year driven by improving pricing and cost reduction initiatives.\nOperating Expenses\nR&D expense decreased $102 million or 5% in 2024 compared to 2023, which was primarily driven by a $31 million decrease in compensation and benefits, a $30 million decrease in depreciation and amortization and a $13 million decrease in outside services. The decrease in compensation and benefits was due to a reduction in headcount. The reduction in depreciation and amortization is attributed to lower capital expenditures in 2024 compared to 2023.\n39\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense decreased $142 million or 15% in 2024 compared to 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a $133 million decrease in intangible amortization expense and a $13 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase of $18 million in material purchases. The reduction in intangible amortization expense was due to most of our intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the previous year.\nLitigation matter of $291 million for the year ended June 28, 2024 was related to a judgment in an intellectual property dispute as disclosed in Part II Item 8, Note 17,\nLegal Proceedings,\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmployee termination, asset impairment, and other decreased $54 million or 28% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting fewer restructuring actions taken in the current period and a gain on the sale-leaseback of our Milpitas, California facility, partially offset by higher contract termination charges and asset impairments caused by project cancellations.\nFor additional information regarding employee termination, asset impairment, and other, see Part II, Item 8, Note 15,\nEmployee Termination, Asset Impairment, and Other\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness separation costs were $97 million for the year ended June 28, 2024, primarily reflecting $33 million of charges incurred for stamp duties associated with establishing new legal entities, with the remaining charges attributable to fees to outside professional service providers to support the planned separation of our Flash and HDD businesses.\nInterest and Other Income\nTotal interest and other income, net\nincreased $79 million or 30%\nin 2024 compared to 2023,\nprimarily reflecting a $105 million of higher\ninterest expense resulting from increases in interest rates and higher outstanding debt balance, partially offset by higher other income, net, of $11 million, driven primarily by a net gain on our strategic investments, and $15 million of higher interest income due to higher interest rates.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses. We completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Act during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. However, the U.S. Treasury and the IRS have issued tax guidance on certain provisions of the 2017 Act since the enactment date, and we anticipate the issuance of additional regulatory and interpretive guidance. We applied a reasonable interpretation of the 2017 Act along with the then-available guidance in finalizing our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Act. Any additional regulatory or interpretive guidance would constitute new information, which may require further refinements to our estimates in future periods.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained significant law changes related to tax, climate, energy and health care. The tax measures include, among other things, a corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) of 15% on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) exceeding $1.00 billion. The CAMT is effective for us beginning with fiscal year 2024. We are not subject to the CAMT of 15% for fiscal year 2024 as our average annual AFSI did not exceed $1.00 billion for the preceding three-year period.\nThe following table sets forth Income tax information from our Consolidated Statements of Operations by dollar and effective tax rate:\nBeginning in 2023, the 2017 Act requires us to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses rather than expensing them in the year incurred. The tax effects related to the capitalization of R&D expenses are included in the effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2024.\n40\nThe primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for 2024 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, credits, and tax holidays in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand that will expire at various dates during years 2025 through 2031. On November 1, 2023, one of our tax holidays in Malaysia expired. We have applied for an extension and anticipate this extension, if granted, will be applied retroactively and begin on November 2, 2023. Because the exact terms of the extension are not currently known, we are applying the Malaysia corporate statutory tax rate on the expired tax holiday income. If a retroactive extension is granted, we will make an adjustment to our effective tax rate in that period.\nThe primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for 2023 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, credits, and tax holidays in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand that will expire at various dates during years 2025 through 2031.\nOur future effective tax rate is subject to future regulatory developments and changes in the mix of our U.S. earnings compared to foreign earnings. The 2017 Act requires us to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses rather than expensing them in the year incurred. As described above, these capitalized expenses are included in our effective tax rate for 2024, but did not have a material impact on the effective tax rate due to our reduced profitability. Mandatory capitalization of R&D is expected to materially increase our effective tax rate and taxes paid in future periods, if not repealed or otherwise modified. In addition, our total tax expense in future years may also vary as a result of discrete items such as excess tax benefits or deficiencies.\nOn December 20, 2021, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting released Model Global Anti-Base Erosion rules under Pillar Two (“Pillar Two Model Rules”). Several non-US jurisdictions have either enacted legislation or announced their intention to enact future legislation to adopt certain or all components of the Pillar Two Model Rules, which may be effective for us as early as 2025. When effective, this legislation could materially increase our tax obligations in certain jurisdictions. We continue to evaluate the tax impact of enacted and future legislation concerning the Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions we operate in.\nFor additional information regarding Income tax expense, see Part II, Item 8, Note 13,\nIncome Tax Expense\n, of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA discussion of our results of operations for 2022, including a comparison of such results of operations to 2023, is included in Part II, Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on August 22, 2023.\n41\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our statements of cash flows:\nWe had previously reached a final agreement with the IRS and received notices of deficiency with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and in February 2024, we also reached a final agreement for resolving the notices of proposed adjustments with respect to years 2013 through 2015. During the twelve months ended June 28, 2024, we made payments of $363 million for tax and $161 million for interest with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and recorded adjustments to align with IRS calculations, resulting in a remaining liability of $185 million as of June 28, 2024, related to all years from 2008 through 2015. We expect to pay any remaining balance with respect to this matter within the next twelve months.\nIn connection with settlements for the years 2008 through 2015, we expect to realize reductions to our mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations and tax savings from interest deductions in future years aggregating to $165 million. Of this amount, $34 million of interest savings from the interest paid with respect to years 2008 through 2012 is classified as a deferred tax asset due to interest expense limitation rules. See Part II, Item 8, Note 13,\nIncome Tax Expense,\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have an existing shelf registration statement (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) filed with the SEC, which allows us to offer and sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and debt securities. The Shelf Registration Statement expires in late August 2024, and we plan to renew the Shelf Registration Statement at that time. We may use the Shelf Registration Statement or other capital sources, including other offerings of equity or debt securities or the credit markets, to satisfy future financing needs, including planned or unanticipated capital expenditures, investments, debt repayments or other expenses. Any such additional financing will be subject to market conditions and may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nAs noted previously, in 2024, we had scaled back on capital expenditures, consolidating production lines and reducing bit growth to align with market demand. We reduced our expenditures for property, plant and equipment and our portion of the Flash Ventures’ capital expenditures for its operations to approximately $825 million in 2024 from approximately $2.22 billion in 2023. After consideration of the Flash Ventures’ lease financing of its capital expenditures and net operating cash flow, we reduced our net cash used for our purchases of property, plant and equipment and net activity in notes receivable relating to Flash Ventures to $53 million in 2024 from $794 million in 2023. We continue to be cautious in our capital investment and expect our cash capital expenditures in 2025 to remain below 2023 expenditures.\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents as well as our available revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. We believe we can also access the various capital markets to further supplement our liquidity position if necessary. Our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA total of $1.43 billion and\n$1.28 billion\nof our cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the U.S. as of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. There are no material tax consequences that were not previously accrued for on the repatriation of this cash.\nOur cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government agency securities. In addition, from time to time, we also invest directly in certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and corporate and municipal notes and bonds.\n42\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by or used in operating activities primarily consists of net income or loss, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or minus changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities was\n$307 million\nfor 2024, as compared to $92 million of net cash provided by such changes for 2023, which largely reflects payments made on the IRS matter and an increase in net operating assets and liabilities resulting from the increase in the volume of our business. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by our working capital requirements, which are dependent on our volume of business and the effective management of our cash conversion cycle as well as timing of payments for taxes. Our cash conversion cycle measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales. At the end of the respective fourth quarters, the cash conversion cycles were as follows (in days):\nChanges in days sales outstanding (“DSO”) are generally due to the timing of shipments to and collections from customers. Changes in days in inventory (“DIO”) are generally related to the timing of inventory builds and shipments to customers. Changes in days payables outstanding (“DPO”) are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period. From time to time, we make payment term modifications with vendors through negotiations with them or by granting to, or receiving from, our vendors payment term accommodations. We make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our cash balances.\nIn 2024, DSO decreased by 2 days over the prior year, reflecting timing of shipments and customer collections, partially offset by a 5-day increase from lower accounts receivable factoring. DIO decreased by 4 days over the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in products shipped. DPO increased 9 days over the prior year, primarily due to more favorable payment terms and routine variations in the timing of purchases and payments during the period.\nInvesting Activities\nN\net cash used in investing activities in 2024 primarily consisted of $487 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $239 million in net\nnotes receivable proceeds from (issuances to) Flash Ventures and $195 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities in 2023 primarily consisted of $821 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by $14 million in net notes receivable proceeds from (issuances to) Flash Ven\ntures.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2024, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $3.00 billion in proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, the drawdown of the Delayed Draw Term Loan and draws on the revolving credit facility. These sources were partially offset by $2.10 billion used for the repayment of draws on the revolving credit facility, repayments of the Delayed Draw Term Loan, scheduled payments on the Term Loan A-2, and settlement of the remaining 2024 Convertible Notes; $505 million used to repurchase a portion of the 2024 Convertible Notes and $155 million for the purchase of capped calls to hedge the potential dilution impact of the conversion feature of the 2028 Convertible Notes. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2023 primarily consisted of $881 million from the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and $93 million from issuance of stock under employee stock plans, partially offset by $80 million used for taxes paid on vested stock awards under employee stock plans. In addition, we drew and repaid $1.18 billion under our revolving credit facility within the period.\nA discussion of our cash flows for 2022, including a comparison of such cash flows to 2023, is included in Part II, Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources\n, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on\nAugust 22, 2023.\n43\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than the commitments related to Flash Ventures incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions (see “Short- and Long-term Liquidity –\nIndemnifications\n” below), we do not have any other material off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any other obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, with the exception of Flash Ventures and our joint venture with Unisplendour Corporation Limited and Unissoft (Wuxi) Group Co. Ltd. (“Unis”), referred to as the “Unis Venture”, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any variable interest entities. For additional information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Part II, Item 8, Note 9,\nRelated Parties and Related Commitments and Contingencies\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n44\nShort- and Long-term Liquidity\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe following is a summary of our known material cash requirements, including those for capital expenditures, as of June 28, 2024. In addition, see the discussions further below related to unrecognized tax benefits, the intellectual property litigation, dividend rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, foreign exchange contracts and indemnifications.\n(1)\nPrincipal portion of debt, excluding discounts and issuance costs based on contractual maturity. As of June 28, 2024, $1.60 billion of our 2028 Convertible Notes are currently convertible at the option of the holders through September 30, 2024, at which point the trading price of our common stock price will be re-evaluated to determine if the 2028 Convertible Notes will continue to be convertible in the subsequent calendar quarter.\n(2)\nIncludes reimbursement for depreciation and lease payments on owned and committed equipment, funding commitments for loans and equity investments and payments for other committed expenses, including R&D and building depreciation. Funding commitments assume no additional operating lease guarantees. Additional operating lease guarantees can reduce funding commitments.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAs of June 28, 2024, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was approximately $721 million. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in liabilities for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of June 28, 2024, were approximately $181 million. Of these amounts, approximately $736 million could result in potential cash payments.\nAs noted above, we had previously reached a final agreement with the IRS regarding notices of deficiency with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and in February 2024, we also reached a final agreement for resolving the notices of proposed adjustments with respect to years 2013 through 2015. During the twelve months ended June 28, 2024, we made payments of $363 million for tax and $161 million for interest with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and recorded adjustments to align with IRS calculations, resulting in a remaining liability of $185 million as of June 28, 2024 related to all years from 2008 through 2015. We expect to pay any remaining balance with respect to this matter within the next twelve months.\nIn connection with settlements for the years 2008 through 2015, we expect to realize reductions to our mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations and tax savings from interest deductions in future years aggregating to approximately $165 million. Of this amount, $34 million of interest savings from the interest paid with respect to years 2008 through 2012 is classified as a deferred tax asset due to interest expense limitation rules. See Part II, Item 8, Note 13,\nIncome Tax Expense\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n45\nIntellectual Property Litigation\nAs of June 28, 2024, we have recognized an aggregate liability of $384 million within Accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 28, 2024, for the potential loss from a litigation matter, as discussed in Part II, Item 8, Note 17,\nLegal Proceedings\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Of that amount, $291 million was recognized as Litigation matter under Operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended June 28, 2024 and $93 million recognized within Other non-current assets on the our Consolidated Balance Sheets as June 28, 2024, to be amortized over the remaining lives of the MRT Patents. See Part II, Item 8, Note 17,\nLegal Proceedings\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nDividends\nAs of June 28, 2024, 235,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock remained outstanding. These shares are entitled to cumulative preferred dividends and will also participate in any dividends declared for common shareholders on an as-converted equivalent basis. See Part II, Item 8, Note 12,\nShareholders’ Equity and Convertible Preferred Stock\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these dividend provisions.\nIn April 2020, we suspended the payment of dividends to common shareholders and intend to utilize cash from operations to reinvest in the business and to support our ongoing deleveraging efforts.\nDebt\nAs described in “Key Developments –\nFinancing Activities\n” above, we undertook several financing actions during 2024, including the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes and the repurchase and/or settlement of our 2024 Convertible Notes.\nThe 2028 Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of any holder at an initial conversion price of approximately $52.20 per share of common stock beginning August 15, 2028. Prior to that date, if the trading price of our common stock remains above 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the end of a calendar quarter, holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes would have the right to convert the 2028 Convertible Notes during the next succeeding calendar quarter. The 2028 Convertible Notes are also convertible prior to that date upon the occurrence of certain corporate events. Upon any conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we will pay cash for the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.\nDuring the 30 trading-day period ended June 28, 2024, the last trading day of the applicable calendar quarter, the trading price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the then-applicable conversion price for the 2028 Convertible Notes for at least 20 trading days. As such, the conditional conversion feature of the 2028 Convertible Notes was triggered and the 2028 Convertible Notes are convertible through September 30, 2024, at which point the trading price of our common stock price will be re-evaluated to determine if the 2028 Convertible Notes will continue to be convertible in the subsequent calendar quarter.\nIn addition to our existing debt, as of\nJune 28, 2024\n, we had $2.22 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility until January 2027, subject to customary conditions under the loan agreement. The agreements governing our credit facilities each include limits on secured indebtedness and certain types of unsecured subsidiary indebtedness and require us and certain of our subsidiaries to provide guarantees and collateral to the extent the conditions providing for such guarantees and collateral are met. Additional information regarding our indebtedness, including information about availability under our revolving credit facility and the principal repayment terms, interest rates, covenants and other key terms of our outstanding indebtedness, is included in Part II, Item 8, Note 7,\nDebt\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The loan\nagreement governing our revolving credit facility and our Term Loan A-2 due 2027 require us to comply with certain financial covenants, consisting of a minimum leverage ratio covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant. As of June 28, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.\n46\nFlash Ventures\nFlash Ventures sells to, and leases back from, a consortium of financial institutions a portion of its tools and has entered into equipment lease agreements, of which we guarantee half or all of the outstanding obligations under each lease agreement. The leases are subject to customary covenants and cancellation events that relate to Flash Ventures and each of the guarantors. The occurrence of a cancellation event could result in an acceleration of the lease obligations and a call on our guarantees. As of June 28, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under these Japanese lease facilities. See Part II, Item 8, Note 9,\nRelated Parties and Related Commitments and Contingencies\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding Flash Ventures.\nPurchase Obligations and Other Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of components used to manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components. We also enter into long-term agreements with suppliers that contain fixed future commitments, which are contingent on certain conditions such as performance, quality and technology of the vendor’s components. These arrangements are included under “Purchase obligations and other commitments” in the table above.\nMandatory Deemed Repatriation Tax\nThe following is a summary of our estimated mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations that are payable in the following years (in millions):\nMandatory Research and Development Expense Capitalization\nSince the beginning of 2023, the 2017 Act has required us to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses rather than expensing them in the year incurred, which is expected to result in materially higher cash tax payments in future profitable periods, if not repealed or otherwise modified.\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nWe purchase foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies. For a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments, see Part II, Item 8, Note 6,\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of agreements, products or services to be provided by us, environmental compliance, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements.\n47\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of operations and financial condition, see Part II, Item 8, Note 2,\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. We have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements may be material.\nRevenue\nWe provide distributors and retailers (collectively referred to as “resellers”) with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions. We also provide resellers and OEMs with other sales incentive programs. We record estimated variable consideration related to these items as a reduction to revenue at the time of revenue recognition. We use judgment in our assessment of variable consideration in contracts to be included in the transaction price. We use the expected value method to arrive at the amount of variable consideration. We constrain variable consideration until the likelihood of a significant revenue reversal is not probable and believes that the expected value method is the appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration based on the fact that we have a large number of contracts with similar characteristics.\nFor sales to OEMs, our methodology for estimating variable consideration is based on the amount of consideration expected to be earned based on the OEMs’ volume of purchases from us or other agreed-upon sales incentive programs. For sales to resellers, the methodology for estimating variable consideration is based on several factors including historical pricing information, current pricing trends and channel inventory levels. Estimating the impact of these factors requires significant judgement and the estimated amount of variable consideration can differ from the actual amount.\nInventories\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“NRV”), with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs of our inventory to lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory based on assumptions, which requires significant judgement. The determination of NRV involves estimating the ASPs less any selling expenses of inventory based on market conditions and customer demand. To estimate the ASPs and selling expenses of inventory, we review historical sales, future demand, economic conditions, contract prices and other information.\nWe periodically perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based on assumptions, which includes changes in business and economic conditions, changes in technology and projected demand of our products. If in any period we anticipate a change in those assumptions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and could materially and negatively impact our gross margin. If in any period, we can sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the realized selling price in previous period, higher gross profit would be recognized in that period. While adjustments to these reserves have generally not been material to the years presented, in 2023, we recorded a charge to Cost of revenue of approximately $130 million, primarily to reduce component inventory to net realizable value as a result of a sudden change in demand for certain products.\n48\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each quarter, we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The assessment of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets requires estimations and significant judgment. We continue to assess and adjust our valuation allowance based on operating results and market conditions. We account for interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nWe recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. To the extent a tax position does not meet a more-likely-than-not level of certainty, no benefit is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. If a position meets the more-likely-than-not level of certainty, it is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes. The actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previously-recorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of our fourth quarter for each reporting unit. We use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired and whether a quantitative test for impairment is considered necessary. If we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired, we are required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine the amount of impairment. We are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test, including in the identification of our reporting units. We also make judgments and assumptions in the assignment of assets and liabilities to our reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. In addition, the estimates used to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units may change based on results of operations, macroeconomic conditions or other factors. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. If our stock price decreases significantly, goodwill could become impaired, which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations. We have not identified any impairment indicators for our reporting units as of June 28, 2024. We also did not incur any impairment charges for 2023 or 2022.\nLitigation and Contingencies\nWe disclose information regarding claims and contingencies where the likelihood of a material loss is probable or reasonably possible. If a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an accrual for the loss. In such cases, there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued. Where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible, we disclose the matter and an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made, unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves significant judgments about the merits of the claim, applicable law, potential outcomes, estimates and inherent uncertainties. We engage relevant subject matter experts to assist us with our assessment of available information to reach conclusions on the likelihood and amount, or range, of potential loss. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from our estimates.\n49"

    "text": "Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk\nAlthough the majority of our transactions are in U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various foreign currencies. We purchase short-term foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for product costs and Operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations. Substantially all of the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months. We do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes. For additional information, see Part II, Item 8, Note 5,\nFair Value Measurements and Investments,\nand Note 6,\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have performed sensitivity analyses for 2024, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts used to offset the underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates used in performing the sensitivity analyses were based on market rates in effect at June 28, 2024. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $248 million at June 28, 2024.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, total net realized and unrealized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNotwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks, we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures, and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.\nDisclosure About Interest Rate Risk\nVariable Interest Rate Risk\nWe have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. As of June 28, 2024, our variable rate debt outstanding consisted of our Term Loan A-2, which is based on various index rates as discussed further in Note 7,\nDebt\n, of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of June 28, 2024, the outstanding balance on our Term Loan A-2 was $2.59 billion and a 1% increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by $26 million.\n50"

    "text": "Index to Financial Statements\n51\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nWestern Digital Corporation:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, convertible preferred stock and shareholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A\nControls and Procedures – Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n52\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAssessment of variable consideration for sales to resellers\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides resellers with price protection and other sales incentive programs. The Company uses judgment in its assessment of variable consideration related to these items in contracts to be included in the transaction price. The Company’s estimate of variable consideration for sales to resellers is based on several factors, including historical pricing information, current pricing trends, and channel inventory levels.\nWe identified the assessment of variable consideration for sales to resellers as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s historical pricing information and the level of channel inventory used to determine variable consideration for sales to resellers.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process for determining the variable consideration, including certain controls related to historical pricing information and the level of channel inventory. We evaluated historical pricing by inspecting a sample of customer contracts with resellers and comparing the sales incentives earned during the year to the sales incentive program terms and conditions and recalculating amounts paid to the resellers. We tested the channel inventory levels by comparing the on-hand inventory amounts for a sample of resellers to information obtained from the resellers and evaluated the reasonableness of reconciling items.\n/s/\nKPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1970.\nSanta Clara, California\nAugust 19, 2024\n53\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in millions, except par value)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n54\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n55\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n56\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n57\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n58\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1.\nOrganization and Basis of Presentation\nWestern Digital Corporation (“Western Digital” or the “Company”) is a leading developer, manufacturer, and provider of data storage devices and solutions based on both hard disk drives and NAND flash technologies.\nThe Company’s broad portfolio of technology and products addresses the following key end markets: Cloud, Client and Consumer. The Company also generates immaterial license and royalty revenue from its extensive intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio, which is included in each of these three end market categories.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company has prepared its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and has adopted accounting policies and practices which are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates. The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized below.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to June 30 and typically consists of 52 weeks. Approximately every five to six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align the fiscal year with the foregoing policy. Fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, which ended on June 28, 2024, June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively, are comprised of 52 weeks, with all quarters presented consisting of 13 weeks. Unless otherwise indicated, references herein to specific years and quarters are to fiscal years and fiscal quarters, and references to financial information are on a consolidated basis.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company manufactures, markets, and sells data storage devices and solutions in the United States (“U.S.”) and in foreign countries through its sales personnel, dealers, distributors, retailers, and subsidiaries. The Company manages and reports under\ntwo\nreportable segments: hard disk drives (“HDD”) and flash-based products (“Flash”).\nThe Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), evaluates the performance of the Company and makes decisions regarding the allocation of resources based on each operating segment’s net revenue and gross margin. Because of the integrated nature of the Company’s production and distribution activities, separate segment asset measures are either not available or not used as a basis for the CODM to evaluate the performance of or to allocate resources to the segments.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The functional currency of most of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The accounts of these foreign subsidiaries have been remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement of these accounts from local currencies into U.S. dollars were immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a weighted average exchange rate for each period for statement of operations items. Translation adjustments are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of shareholders’ equity.\n59\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nBusiness Separation Costs\nOn October 30, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had completed its strategic review of its business and, after evaluating a comprehensive range of alternatives, authorized the Company to pursue a plan to separate its HDD and Flash business units to create two independent, public companies. As a result of the plan, the Company has incurred separation and transition costs and expects to incur such costs through the completion of the separation of the businesses. The separation and transition costs are recorded within Business separation costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nUse of Estimates\nCompany management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and assumptions have been applied using methodologies that are consistent throughout the periods presented. However, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments in money market funds, which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government agency securities as well as bank certificates of deposit with original maturities at purchase of three months or less. These deposits are typically in excess of U.S. insured limits. Cash equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\nEquity Investments\nThe Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. The equity method of accounting is used if the Company’s ownership interest is greater than or equal to 20% but less than a majority, or where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. The Company’s equity in the earnings or losses in equity-method investments is recognized in Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and were immaterial for all years presented.\nIf the Company’s ownership interest is less than 20% and the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee, the Company accounts for these investments at fair value, or if these equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value, these securities are measured and recorded using the measurement alternative under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” which is cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes. These investments are recorded within Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are periodically analyzed to determine whether or not there are indicators of impairment.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company evaluates its investments and other significant relationships to determine whether any investee is a variable interest entity (“VIE”). If the Company concludes that an investee is a VIE, the Company evaluates its power to direct the activities of the investee, its obligation to absorb the expected losses of the investee and its right to receive the expected residual returns of the investee to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the investee. If the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company would consolidate such entity and reflect the non-controlling interest of other beneficiaries of that entity. For the periods presented, the Company determined that it did not have any VIEs that are required to be consolidated.\n60\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value for all periods presented because of the short-term maturity of these assets and liabilities. The carrying value of notes receivable from Flash Ventures also approximates fair value for all periods presented because they bear variable market rates of interest. The fair value of investments that are not accounted for under the equity method is based on appropriate market information.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first out) or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out method is used to value the cost of the majority of the Company’s inventories. Inventory write-downs are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances.\nThe Company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other information and reduces inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of the Company’s products, which may require a write-down of inventory that could materially affect operating results.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The Company’s buildings and improvements are depreciated over periods ranging from\nfifteen\nto\nthirty years\n. The majority of the Company’s machinery and equipment, software, and furniture and fixtures, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of\ntwo\nto\nseven years\n. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The Company performs an annual impairment test as of the beginning of its fourth quarter. The Company uses qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired and whether a quantitative test for impairment is considered necessary. If the Company concludes from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired, the Company is required to perform a quantitative approach to determine the amount of impairment. The Company’s assessment resulted in\nno\nimpairment of goodwill in 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nThe Company is required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. In addition, the estimates used to determine the fair value of reporting units may change based on the results of operations, macroeconomic conditions or other factors. Changes in these estimates could materially affect the Company’s assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment. If the Company’s stock price decreases significantly, goodwill could become impaired, which could result in a material charge and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.\nIPR&D is an intangible asset accounted as an indefinite-lived asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development effort. During the development period, the Company conducts an IPR&D impairment test at least annually or whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the IPR&D is impaired. Events which might indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, adverse cost factors, strategic decisions made in response to economic, market, and competitive conditions, and the impact of the economic environment on the Company and on its customer base. If impairment is indicated, the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company’s assessment resulted in\nno\nimpairment of IPR&D in 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n61\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nOther long-lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received. Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable from undiscounted cash flows. If impairment is indicated, the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The estimates of fair value require evaluation of future market conditions and product lifecycles as well as projected revenue, earnings and cash flow.\nSee Note 4,\nSupplemental Financial Statement Data\n, for additional disclosures related to the Company’s other long-lived assets.\nRevenue and Accounts Receivable\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to the customer. The transaction price to be recognized as revenue is adjusted for variable consideration, such as sales incentives, and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including taxes imposed by governmental authorities. The Company’s performance obligations are typically not considered constrained based on the Company’s history with similar transactions and the fact that uncertainties are resolved in a fairly short period of time.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s revenue is from the sale of tangible products for which the performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time, generally upon delivery. The Company’s services revenue is immaterial, and mainly includes professional service arrangements and post-contract customer support, warranty as a service and maintenance contracts.\nThe performance obligations for the Company’s services are generally satisfied ratably over the service period based on the nature of the service provided and contract terms. Similarly, revenue from patent licensing arrangements is recognized based on whether the arrangement provides the customer a right to use or right to access the IP. Revenue for a right-to-use arrangement is recognized at the time the control of the license is transferred to the customer. Revenue for a right-to-access arrangement is recognized over the contract period using the time lapse method. For the sales-based royalty arrangements, the Company estimates and recognizes revenue in the period in which customers’ licensable sales occur.\nThe Company incurs sales commissions and other direct incremental costs to obtain sales contracts. The Company has applied the practical expedient to recognize the direct incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period is expected to be one year or less or the amount is not material, with these costs charged to Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company had no direct incremental costs to obtain contracts that have an expected benefit of greater than one year.\nThe Company also applies the practical expedients and does not disclose transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations for (i) arrangements that have an original expected duration of one year or less, which mainly consist of the support and maintenance contracts, and (ii) variable consideration amounts for sale-based or usage-based royalties for intellectual property license arrangements, which typically range longer than one year. The transaction price allocated to the Company’s remaining performance obligations as of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, was not material.\nThe contract assets and contract liabilities for the years ended June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023 were not material.\nThe Company’s customer payment terms are typically less than two months from the date control over the product or service is transferred to the customer. The Company uses the practical expedient and does not recognize a significant financing component for payment considerations of less than one year. The financing components of contracts with payment terms were not material.\nThe Company provides distributors and retailers (collectively referred to as “resellers”) with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions. The Company also provides resellers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) with other sales incentive programs. The Company records estimated variable consideration related to these items as a reduction to revenue at the time of revenue recognition. The Company uses judgment in its assessment of variable consideration in contracts to be included in the transaction price. The Company uses the expected value method to arrive at the amount of variable consideration. The Company constrains variable consideration until the likelihood of a significant revenue reversal is not probable and believes that the expected value method is the appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration based on the fact that the Company has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics.\n62\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nFor sales to OEMs, the Company’s methodology for estimating variable consideration is based on the amount of consideration expected to be earned based on the OEMs’ volume of purchases from the Company or other agreed-upon sales incentive programs. For sales to resellers, the Company’s methodology for estimating variable consideration is based on several factors including historical pricing information, current pricing trends and channel inventory levels. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts of variable consideration are recognized as adjustments to revenue.\nMarketing development program costs are typically recorded as a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue. The Company nets sales rebates against open customer receivable balances if the criteria to offset are met, otherwise they are recorded within other accrued liabilities.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company evaluates whether each deliverable is a distinct promise and should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation. If a promised good or service is not distinct in accordance with the revenue guidance, the Company combines that good or service with the other promised goods or services in the arrangement until a distinct bundle of goods is identified. If applicable, the Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations of each distinct product or service, or distinct bundle, based on their relative standalone selling prices.\nThe Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency or other collection issues. In addition, the Company routinely analyzes the various receivable aging categories to establish reserves based on a combination of past-due receivables and expected future losses. If the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if the Company’s overall loss trajectory changes significantly, an adjustment in the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts would be required, which could materially affect operating results.\nWarranty\nThe Company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its products for a period of\none\nto\nfive years\n, with a small number of products having a warranty ranging up to\nten years\nor more. The warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends, estimated replacement costs, estimated repair costs which include scrap costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues, if any. For warranties ten years or greater, including lifetime warranties, the Company uses the estimated useful life of the product to calculate the warranty exposure. A statistical warranty tracking model is used to help prepare estimates and assist the Company in exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates. The statistical tracking model captures specific detail on product reliability, such as factory test data, historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type. Management’s judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base warranty estimates. Management reviews the warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross profit and income. Such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair and could differ significantly from the estimates.\nLitigation and Other Contingencies\nWhen the Company becomes aware of a claim or potential claim, the Company assesses the likelihood of any loss or exposure. The Company discloses information regarding each claim where the likelihood of a material loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible. If a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records an accrual for the loss. In such cases, there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued. Where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made, unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates.\nSee Note 17,\nLegal Proceedings,\nfor additional disclosures related to the Company’s litigation.\n63\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred\nand amounted to $\n56\nmillion, $\n69\nmillion and $\n88\nmillion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These expenses are included in Selling, general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenditures are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each quarter, the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowance so that the Company records net deferred tax assets only to the extent that it has concluded it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nThe Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. To the extent a tax position does not meet a more-likely-than-not level of certainty, no benefit is recognized in the financial statements. If a position meets the more-likely-than-not level of certainty, it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from the Company’s estimates, which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previously-recorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits, and may materially affect the Company’s operating results.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Common Share\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per common share using a two-class method when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires undistributed earnings for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company’s convertible preferred stock contractually entitles the holders of such shares to participate in dividends but does not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the Company’s losses.\nThe Company computes basic income (loss) per common share by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per common share is computed by using diluted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method or the “if-converted” method based on the nature of the securities. Potentially dilutive common shares include dilutive outstanding employee stock options, restricted stock unit awards (“RSUs”) and restricted stock unit awards with performance conditions or market conditions (“PSUs”), rights to purchase shares of common stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), shares issuable in connection with the Company’s convertible notes and convertible preferred stock.\n64\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for all stock-based compensation at fair value. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The fair values of RSUs and PSUs with a performance condition are determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of the grant. The fair values of all ESPP purchase rights are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model and require the input of highly subjective assumptions. The fair values of PSUs with a market condition are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. PSUs are granted to certain employees and vest only after the achievement of pre-determined performance or market conditions and completion of a requisite service period. At the end of each reporting period, the Company evaluates the probability that PSUs with a performance condition will be earned and records the related stock-based compensation expense over the service period. Compensation expense for PSUs with market conditions is recognized ratably over the required service period regardless of expected or actual achievement.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax refers to gains and losses that are recorded as an element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax is primarily comprised of unrealized gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation, and actuarial gains or losses related to pensions.\nDerivative Contracts\nThe majority of the Company’s transactions are in U.S. dollars; however, some transactions are based in various foreign currencies. The Company purchases foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for Operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedging transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the Company’s results of operations. Substantially all of these contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months. All foreign exchange contracts are for risk management purposes only. The Company does not purchase foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The Company had foreign exchange contracts with commercial banks for British pound sterling, European euro, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, Philippine peso, Thai baht, Korean won and Israeli shekel, which had an aggregate notional amount of $\n3.86\nbillion and $\n5.66\nbillion at June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\nIf the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is determined to be highly effective, the change in fair value of the derivative is initially deferred in Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. These amounts are subsequently recognized into earnings when the underlying cash flow being hedged is recognized into earnings. Recognized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are reported in Cost of revenue and Operating expenses, and presented within cash flows from operating activities. The Company previously had interest rate swaps which were accounted for as designated cash flow hedges to mitigate variations in interest payments under a portion of its variable rate\nterm loans.\nThe Company paid interest monthly at a fixed rate and received interest monthly at the applicable index rate\non the notional amoun\nt of the contract with realized gains or losses recognized in Interest expense. Hedge effectiveness is measured by comparing the hedging instrument’s cumulative change in fair value from inception to maturity to the underlying exposure’s terminal value. The Company determined the ineffectiveness associated with its cash flow hedges to be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements for all years presented.\nA change in the fair value of undesignated hedges is recognized in earnings in the period incurred and is reported in Other income, net.\n65\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nPensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement plans covering certain employees in various countries. The benefits are based on the employees’ years of service and compensation. The plans are funded in conformity with the funding requirements of applicable government authorities. The Company amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated average service life of the participants. The measurement date for the plans is the Company’s year-end. The Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and post-retirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with actuarial changes in the funded status recognized through accumulated other comprehensive loss in the year in which such changes occur.\nThe Company reports the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. In addition, the other components of net benefit cost are presented in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain domestic and international facilities and data center space under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through 2039. These leases include no material variable or contingent lease payments. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include prepaid lease payments minus any lease incentives. Extension or termination options present in the Company’s lease agreements are included in determining the right-of-use asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nRevision of Previously Issued Financial Statements\nAs previously disclosed in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended December 29, 2023 and March 29, 2024, in connection with the preparation of its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended December 29, 2023, the Company identified certain errors related to the Company’s reporting and recording of its interests in its equity method investments in Flash Partners Ltd., Flash Alliance Ltd., and Flash Forward Ltd. (collectively, “Flash Ventures”). The errors related to unadjusted differences between Flash Ventures’ application of Japanese generally accepted accounting principles to certain lease-related transactions compared to the applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These unadjusted differences resulted in differences in the equity in earnings from these entities recognized by the Company in Other income (expense), net and the carrying value of the Company’s equity method investments in Flash Ventures.\nBased on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors in accordance with SAB No. 99, “Materiality,” and SAB No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,” and as described further in Note 18,\nRevision of Previously Issued Financial Statements\n, the Company evaluated the errors and determined the related impacts were not material to its financial statements for the prior periods when they occurred, but that correcting the cumulative errors in the period detected would have been material to the Company's results of operations for that period. Accordingly, the Company has revised previously reported financial information presented herein for such immaterial errors. A summary of revisions to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein is included for comparative purposes in Note 18,\nRevision of Previously Issued Financial Statements.\n66\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 2.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update (“ASU”) No. 2022-04, “Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations”, which requires annual and interim disclosures for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. The ASU requires the Company to provide disclosure of outstanding obligations to such suppliers for all balance sheet dates presented beginning with the Company’s first quarter of 2024 and to provide certain rollforward information related to those obligations beginning in the Company’s first fiscal quarter of 2025. The ASU does not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations. The Company adopted the guidance on the first day of fiscal year 2024, except for the rollforward information, which the Company is compiling and intends to provide beginning in fiscal year 2025. See Note 16,\nSupplier Finance Program,\nof the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor information regarding the supplier finance program.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”, which expands on segment reporting requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures surrounding significant segment expenses. The ASU expands on existing segment reporting requirements to require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to an entity's CODM, a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. These incremental disclosures will be required beginning with the Company’s financial statements for the year ending June 27, 2025. The Company expects to provide any required disclosures at that time.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”. The ASU calls for enhanced income tax disclosure requirements surrounding the tabular rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments are effective for the Company’s fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently compiling the information required for these disclosures. These incremental disclosures will be required beginning with the Company’s financial statements for the year ending June 27, 2025. The Company expects to provide any required disclosures at that time.\n67\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 3.\nBusiness Segments, Geographic Information, and Concentrations of Risk\nThe following table summarizes the operating performance of the Company’s reportable segments:\nDisaggregated Revenue\nThe Company’s broad portfolio of technology and products address multiple end markets. Cloud is comprised primarily of products for public or private cloud environments and end customers. Through the Client end market, the Company provides its original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) and channel customers a broad array of high-performance HDD and Flash solutions across personal computer, mobile, gaming, automotive, virtual reality headsets, at-home entertainment and industrial spaces. The Consumer end market is highlighted by the Company’s broad range of retail and other end-user products, which capitalize on the strength of the Company’s product brand recognition and vast points of presence around the world.\nThe Company’s disaggregated revenue information is as follows:\n68\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Company’s operations outside the United States include manufacturing facilities in China, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, as well as sales offices throughout the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The following tables summarize the Company’s operations by geographic area:\n(1)\nNet revenue is attributed to geographic regions based on the ship-to location of the customer. License and royalty revenue is attributed to countries based upon the location of the headquarters of the licensee.\n(1)\nLong-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and are attributed to the geographic location in which they are located.\nCustomer Concentration and Credit Risk\nThe Company sells its products to computer manufacturers and OEMs, cloud service providers, resellers, distributors and retailers throughout the world. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net revenue. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s top 10 customers accounted for\n39\n%,\n43\n% and\n45\n%, respectively, of the Company’s net revenue.\nThe Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition to manage collection risk, in some cases supplemented by collateral. The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses, and such losses have historically been within management’s expectations. At any given point in time, the total amount outstanding from any one of a number of its customers may be individually significant to the Company’s financial condition. As of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, net accounts receivable were $\n2.17\nbillion and $\n1.60\nbillion, respectively, and reserves for potential credit losses were not material. As of June 28, 2024, one customer accounted for\n15\n% of the Company’s net accounts receivable and as of June 30, 2023, two customers accounted for\n15\n% and\n13\n% of the Company’s net accounts receivable.\n69\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Company also has cash equivalent and investment policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or investment instrument and requires that investments be made only with financial institutions or in investment instruments evaluated as highly credit-worthy.\nSupplier Concentration\nAll of the Company’s Flash require silicon wafers for the memory and controller components. The Company’s flash memory wafers are currently supplied almost entirely from Flash Ventures and the Company’s controller wafers are all manufactured by third-party sources. The failure of any of these sources to deliver silicon wafers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, some key components are purchased from single source vendors for which alternative sources are currently not available. Shortages could occur in these essential materials due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. If the Company was unable to procure certain of such materials, the Company’s sales could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. The Company also relies on third-party subcontractors to assemble and test a portion of its products.

The Company is not required to make principal payments on the 2028 Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date. The 2028 Convertible Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by each of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries that guarantees the\n4.75\n% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (currently, Western Digital Technologies, Inc., Sandisk Technologies, Inc. and Sandisk Corporation).\nThe 2028 Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of any holder beginning on August 15, 2028 at an initial conversion price of approximately $\n52.20\nper share of common stock. Prior to that date, if the trading price of the Company’s common stock remains above\n130\n% of the conversion price for at least\n20\ntrading days (whether or not consecutive) during the\n30\nconsecutive trading-day period prior to the end of a calendar quarter, holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes would have the right to convert the 2028 Convertible Notes during the next succeeding calendar quarter. The 2028 Convertible Notes are also convertible prior to that date upon the occurrence of certain corporate events. Upon any conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes, the Company will pay cash for the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.\nDuring the three months ended June 28, 2024, the conditional conversion feature above of the 2028 Convertible Notes was triggered, based on the price of the Company’s common stock, as the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock was greater than or equal to\n130\n% of the then-applicable conversion price for the 2028 Convertible Notes for at least\n20\ntrading days during the period of\n30\nconsecutive trading days ending on June 28, 2024, the last trading day of the applicable calendar quarter. Accordingly, the 2028 Convertible Notes are convertible through September 30, 2024, at which point the common stock price will be re-evaluated to determine if the 2028 Convertible Notes will continue to be convertible in the subsequent calendar quarter. The Company has classified the 2028 Convertible Notes as current liabilities in the Company’s\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nas of June 28, 2024.\nNet proceeds from the 2028 Convertible Notes were approximately $\n1.56\nbillion after deducting issuance costs of approximately $\n37\nmillion. Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2028 Convertible Notes. As of June 28, 2024, issuance costs of $\n32\nmillion remained unamortized.\nFor the year ended June 28, 2024, the total interest expense was $\n37\nmillion with coupon interest expense of $\n32\nmillion and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $\n5\nmillion, respectively.\n77\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, the Company also entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Calls”). The Capped Calls each have a strike price of approximately $\n52.20\nper share, subject to certain adjustments, which correspond to the initial conversion price of the 2028 Convertible Notes. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $\n70.26\nper share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately\n8\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock. The Capped Calls are generally intended to reduce or offset the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes with such reduction or offset, as the case may be, subject to a cap based on the cap price. However, if the market price per share of the Company’s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Calls, exceeds the cap prices of the Capped Calls, there would not be an offset for the excess. The Capped Calls are separate transactions, and not part of the terms of the 2028 Convertible Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of the Capped Calls of $\n155\nmillion, net of $\n37\nmillion in deferred tax assets, was recorded as a decrease to Additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn February 2018, the Company issued $\n1.10\nbillion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due February 1, 2024 (the “2024 Convertible Notes”). The 2024 Convertible Notes bore interest at an annual rate of\n1.50\n% with interest payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Contemporaneously with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes as noted above, the Company entered into individually negotiated transactions with certain holders of the Company’s 2024 Convertible Notes to repurchase approximately $\n508\nmillion aggregate principal amount of such notes at an immaterial discount. On February 1, 2024, the Company settled all remaining 2024 Convertible Notes in accordance with their original terms for an aggregate cash principal payment of $\n592\nmillion plus interest.\nDuring the year ended June 28, 2024, the Company entered into a third amendment (“Amendment No. 3”) to the Company’s Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2022 which governs the Term-Loan A-2 and the revolving credit facility maturing in January 2027 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). Amendment No. 3 extended the time period during which certain real property is excluded from the collateral package supporting the obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a ratio (“Leverage Ratio”) of total funded debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) below a maximum at the end of each quarter as follows:\nFor the purpose of the Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, except that for the quarters ended June 28, 2024 and September 27, 2024, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA shall be (i) for the quarter ending June 28, 2024, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for such quarter and the immediately preceding quarter multiplied by two and (ii) for the quarter ending September 27, 2024, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for such quarter and the two immediately preceding quarters multiplied by four-thirds.\nIn addition, as of June 28, 2024, the Credit Agreement requires the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain minimum liquidity (defined as the sum of cash and cash equivalents plus available unused capacity under its 2027 Revolving Facility less the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness that matures within 12 months of such date) of $\n2.00\nbillion at the end of each quarter through September 27, 2024. As of June 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\n78\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Credit Agreement also requires the Company to comply with customary covenants that include, among others, limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens on property, acquisitions and investments, loans and guarantees, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolution, asset sales, dividends and distribution, and other payments in respect of the Company’s capital stock, prepayments of certain debt, transactions with affiliates and certain modifications of organizational documents and certain debt agreements.\nThe Term Loan A-2 Loan bears interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate equal to either (x) the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin varying from\n1.125\n% to\n2.000\n% or (y) a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from\n0.125\n% to\n1.000\n%, in each case depending on the corporate family ratings of the Company from at least two of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

The Company is also required to pay an unused commitment fee on the 2027 Revolving Facility ranging from\n0.120\n% to\n0.350\n% based on the corporate family ratings of the Company from at least two of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, with an initial unused commitment fee of\n0.200\n%.\nUnder the term of the Credit Agreement, the 2027 Revolving Facility and Term Loan A-2 (the “Credit Facilities”) are unconditionally guaranteed by Western Digital Technologies, Inc., Sandisk Technologies, Inc. and Sandisk Corporation (the “Guarantors”) and are secured on a first-priority basis (subject to permitted liens) by a lien on substantially all assets and properties of the Company and the Guarantors (the “Collateral”), subject to certain exceptions. Furthermore, the obligations under the Company’s\n2.850\n% Senior Notes due 2029 and\n3.100\n% Senior Notes due 2032 have been secured by the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis to the obligations under the Credit Facilities for so long as and to the extent required under the terms of the Indenture, and the obligations under the Company’s 2026 Senior Unsecured Notes have been guaranteed by the Guarantors pursuant to the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 20, 2023 and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 26, 2024 (the “2026 Senior Notes Supplemental Indentures”) for so long as and to the extent required under the terms of the indenture governing such notes and the 2026 Senior Notes Supplemental Indentures.\nIn August 2023, the Company drew $\n600\nmillion under a delayed draw term loan agreement, which was repaid in full in June 2024. That delayed draw term loan agreement is now terminated. Borrowings under that delayed draw term loan agreement bore interest, at a rate based on SOFR Rate plus an applicable margin.\nIn December 2021, the Company issued $\n500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n2.850\n% senior notes due February 1, 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”) and issued $\n500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n3.100\n% senior notes due February 1, 2032 (the “2032 Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of an indenture, dated as of December 10, 2021 (the “Base Indenture”) between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Senior Notes Trustee”), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated as of December 10, 2021 (the “Senior Notes First Supplemental Indenture”) between the Company and the Senior Notes Trustee.

There were\nno\nmaterial prior service credits for the Pension Plans recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 28, 2024.\nNet periodic benefit costs were not material for 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n81\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nAssumptions\nWeighted-Average Assumptions\nThe weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the projected benefit obligations for the Pension Plans were as follows:\nThe weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit costs for the Pension Plans were as follows:\nThe Company develops a discount rate by calculating when the estimated benefit payments will be due. Management then matches the benefit payments to high quality bonds which match the timing of the expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate.\nThe Company develops the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by analyzing rates of return in each plan as well as the investment portfolio applicable to the plan depending on each plan’s economic environment. The Company’s estimates of future rates of return on assets is based in large part on the projected rate of return from the respective investment managers using a long-term view of historical returns, as well as actuarial recommendations using the most current generational and mortality tables and rates. As of June 28, 2024, the Pension Plans’ assets materially consisted of plan assets related to the Japan pension plan and as such the assumption used herein is primarily related to the Japan pension plan.\nThe Company develops the rate of compensation increase assumptions using local compensation practices and historical rates of increases.\nPlan Assets\nInvestment Policies and Strategies\nThe investment policy in the Pension Plans is to generate a stable return on investments over a long-term horizon in order to have adequate pension funds to meet the Company’s future obligations. In order to achieve this investment goal, a diversified portfolio with target asset allocation and expected rate of return is established by considering factors such as composition of participants, level of funded status, capacity to absorb risks and the current economic environment. The target asset allocation is\n55\n% in debt securities,\n30\n% in equity securities, and the remaining\n15\n% in other assets. Risk management is accomplished through diversification, periodic review of plan asset performance and appropriate realignment of asset allocation. Assumptions regarding the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are periodically reviewed and are based on the historical trend of returns, the risk and correlation of each asset and the latest economic environment.\nThe expected long-term rate of return is estimated based on many factors, including expected forecast for inflation, risk premiums for each asset class, expected asset allocation, current and future financial market conditions and diversification and rebalancing strategies. Historical return patterns and correlations, consensus return forecasts and other relevant financial factors are analyzed periodically by the investment advisor so as to ensure that the expected long-term rate of return is reasonable and appropriate.\n82\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nFair Value Measurements\nThe following tables present the Pension Plans’ major asset categories and their associated fair values and net asset values as of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023:\n(1)\nCommingled funds represent pooled institutional investments.\n(2)\nEquity mutual funds invest primarily in equity securities.\n(3)\nFixed income mutual funds invest primarily in fixed income securities.\nThere were no significant movements of assets between any level categories in 2024 or 2023.\nFair Value Valuation Techniques\nEquity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded. Equity commingled/mutual funds are typically valued using the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the investment manager or administrator of the fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus liabilities and divided by the number of shares or units outstanding. These assets are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2, depending on availability of quoted market prices for identical or similar assets.\nIf available, fixed income securities are valued using the close price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. The fair value of other fixed income securities is typically estimated using pricing models and quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and is generally classified as Level 2.\nCash equivalents includes money market accounts that are valued at their cost plus interest on a daily basis, which approximates fair value. Short-term investments represent securities with original maturities of one year or less. These assets are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2.\n83\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nCash Flows\nThe Company’s expected employer contributions for 2025 and annual benefit payments over the next\nfive years\nfor its Pension Plans are not expected to be material.\n84\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 9.\nRelated Parties and Related Commitments and Contingencies\nFlash Ventures\nThe Company procures substantially all of its flash-based memory wafers from its business ventures with Kioxia Corporation (“Kioxia”), which consists of\nthree\nseparate legal entities: Flash Partners Ltd.

The primary purpose of K2 is to provide clean room space to continue the transition of existing flash-based wafer capacity to newer flash technology nodes. Output from K2 is expected to begin in the first half of fiscal year 2026.\nIn connection with the start-up of the K1, K2 and Y7 facilities, the Company has made prepayments over time, and as of June 28, 2024, $\n523\nmillion remain to be credited against future building depreciation charges. As of June 28, 2024, the Company is also committed to make additional building depreciation prepayments of $\n610\nmillion, based on Japanese yen to U.S. dollars exchange rate of\n160.44\nas of such date, payable as follows: $\n372\nmillion in fiscal year 2025, $\n29\nmillion in fiscal year 2026, $\n109\nmillion in fiscal year 2027, $\n87\nmillion in fiscal year 2028 and $\n13\nmillion in fiscal year 2029. As of June 28, 2024, in addition to the requirements to make building depreciation prepayments, the Company will also make payments for building depreciation of approximately $\n290\nmillion at varying dates through fiscal year 2035.\n85\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Company accounts for its ownership position of each entity within Flash Ventures under the equity method of accounting. The financial and other support provided by the Company in all periods presented was either contractually required or the result of a joint decision to expand wafer capacity, transition to new technologies or refinance existing equipment lease commitments. Entities within Flash Ventures are VIEs. The Company evaluated whether it is the primary beneficiary of any of the entities within Flash Ventures for all periods presented and determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any of the entities within Flash Ventures because it does not have a controlling financial interest in any of those entities. In determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company analyzed the primary purpose and design of Flash Ventures, the activities that most significantly impact Flash Ventures’ economic performance, and whether the Company had the power to direct those activities. The Company concluded, based upon its\n49.9\n% ownership, the voting structure and the manner in which the day-to-day operations are conducted for each entity within Flash Ventures, that the Company lacked the power to direct most of the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of each entity within Flash Ventures.\nThe following table presents the notes receivable from, and equity investments in, Flash Ventures as of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023:\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company made net payments to Flash Ventures of $\n3.35\nbillion, $\n4.20\nbillion and $\n4.70\nbillion, respectively, for purchased flash-based memory wafers and net loans.\nThe Company makes, or will make, loans to Flash Ventures to fund equipment investments for new process technologies and additional wafer capacity. The Company aggregates its Flash Ventures’ notes receivable into one class of financing receivables due to the similar ownership interest and common structure in each Flash Venture entity. For all reporting periods presented, no loans were past due and no loan impairments were recorded. The Company’s notes receivable from each Flash Ventures entity, denominated in Japanese yen, are secured by equipment owned by that Flash Ventures entity.\nAs of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company had Accounts payable balances due to Flash Ventures of $\n313\nmillion and $\n292\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company’s maximum reasonably estimable loss exposure (excluding lost profits) as a result of its involvement with Flash Ventures, based upon the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate at June 28, 2024, is presented below. Investments in Flash Ventures are denominated in Japanese yen, and the maximum estimable loss exposure excludes any cumulative translation adjustment due to revaluation from the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar.\n86\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nAs of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company’s retained earnings included cumulative undistributed earnings of Flash Ventures of $\n158\nmillion and $\n219\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company is obligated to pay for variable costs incurred in producing its share of Flash Ventures’ flash-based memory wafer supply, based on its three-month forecast, which generally equals\n50\n% of Flash Ventures’ output. The Company is not able to estimate its total wafer purchase commitment obligation beyond its rolling three-month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost of producing the semiconductor wafers.  In addition, the Company is obligated to pay for half of Flash Ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output the Company chooses to purchase. The Company is also committed to fund\n49.9\n% to\n50.0\n% of each Flash Ventures entity’s capital investments to the extent that Flash Ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments.\nFlash Ventures has historically operated near\n100\n% of its manufacturing capacity. During 2024 and 2023, as a result of flash business conditions, the Company temporarily reduced its utilization of its share of Flash Ventures’ manufacturing capacity to an abnormally low level to more closely align the Company’s flash-based wafer supply with projected demand. In 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred costs of $\n249\nmillion and $\n286\nmillion, respectively, associated with the reduction in utilization related to Flash Ventures, which was recorded as a charge to Cost of revenue.\nIn February 2022, contamination of certain material used in manufacturing processes occurred at Flash Ventures’ fabrication facilities in both Yokkaichi and Kitakami, Japan which resulted in damage to inventory units in production, a temporary disruption to production operations and a reduction in the Company’s flash wafer availability. During 2022, the Company incurred charges of $\n207\nmillion related to this contamination incident that were recorded in Cost of revenue and primarily consisted of scrapped inventory and rework costs, decontamination and other costs needed to restore the facilities to normal capacity, as well as charges for under absorption of overhead costs. During 2024, the Company received a recovery of $\n36\nmillion related to this incident from its insurance carriers, which was recorded in Cost of revenue. The Company continues to pursue recovery of its remaining losses associated with this event; however, the total amount of recovery cannot be estimated at this time.\nInventory Purchase Commitments with Flash Ventures.\nPurchase orders placed under Flash Ventures for up to three months are binding and cannot be canceled.\nResearch and Development Activities.\nThe Company participates in common R&D activities with Kioxia and is contractually committed to a minimum funding level. R&D commitments are immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Liabilities\nFlash Ventures sells to and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions a portion of its tools and has entered into equipment lease agreements of which the Company guarantees half or all of the outstanding obligations under each lease agreement. The lease agreements are subject to customary covenants and cancellation events related to Flash Ventures and each of the guarantors. The occurrence of a cancellation event could result in an acceleration of Flash Ventures’ obligations and a call on the Company’s guarantees.\nThe following table presents the Company’s portion of the remaining guarantee obligations under the Flash Ventures’ lease facilities in both Japanese yen and U.S. dollar-equivalent, based upon the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of June 28, 2024.\n87\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following table details the breakdown of the Company’s remaining guarantee obligations between the principal amortization and the purchase option exercise price at the end of the term of the Flash Ventures lease agreements, in annual installments as of June 28, 2024 in U.S. dollars, based upon the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of June 28, 2024:\nThe Company and Kioxia have agreed to mutually contribute to, and indemnify each other and Flash Ventures for, environmental remediation costs or liability resulting from Flash Ventures’ manufacturing operations in certain circumstances. The Company has not made any indemnification payments, nor recorded any indemnification receivables, under any such agreements. As of June 28, 2024, no amounts have been accrued in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nwith respect to these indemnification agreements.\nUnis Venture\nThe Company has a joint venture with Unisplendour Corporation Limited and Unissoft (Wuxi) Group Co. Ltd. (“Unis”), referred to as the “Unis Venture”, to market and sell the Company’s products in China and to develop data storage systems for the Chinese market in the future. The Unis Venture is\n49\n% owned by the Company and\n51\n% owned by Unis. The Company accounts for its investment in the Unis Venture under the equity method of accounting. Revenue on products distributed by the Unis Venture is recognized upon sell through to third-party customers. For the years ended June 28, 2024, June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, the Company recognized approximately\n3\n%,\n3\n% and\n4\n% of its consolidated revenue on products distributed by the Unis Venture, respectively. The outstanding accounts receivable due from the Unis Venture were\n7\n% and\n8\n% of Accounts receivable, net as of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n88\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 10.\nLeases and Other Commitments\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain domestic and international facilities and data center space under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through 2039. These leases include no material variable or contingent lease payments. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include prepaid lease payments minus any lease incentives. Extension or termination options present in the Company’s lease agreements are included in determining the right-of-use asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe following table presents right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nThe following table summarizes supplemental disclosures of operating cost and cash flow information related to operating leases:\nThe weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate for the Company’s operating leases were as follows:\n89\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nAs of June 28, 2024, minimum lease payments were as follows:\nSale-Leaseback\nDuring the year ended June 28, 2024, the Company completed a sale and leaseback of its facility in Milpitas, California. The Company received net proceeds of $\n191\nmillion in cash and recorded a gain of $\n85\nmillion on the sale. In connection with the sale, the Company agreed to lease back the facility at an annual lease rate of $\n16\nmillion for the first year, increasing by\n3\n% per year thereafter through January 1, 2039. The lease includes\nthree\n5-year\nrenewal options and\none\n4-year\nrenewal option for the ability to extend through December 2057. The supplemental balance sheet information and supplemental disclosures of operating cost and cash flow information related to the lease are included in the tables above.\nPurchase Agreements and Other Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of components used to manufacture its products. These purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components. The Company also enters into long-term agreements with suppliers that contain fixed future commitments, which are contingent on certain conditions such as performance, quality and technology of the vendor’s components.\nAs of June 28, 2024, the Company had the following minimum long-term commitments:\n90\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 11.\nWestern Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan\nThe Company maintains the Western Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan covers substantially all domestic employees, subject to certain eligibility requirements. Eligible employees receive employer matching contributions immediately upon hire. Eligible employees do not include individuals that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, provide services as a consultant, interns, independent contractors, leased or temporary employees, or who otherwise are not treated as common-law employees.\nEligible employees are able to contribute up to\n85\n% of their eligible compensation on a combined pre-tax and Roth basis regardless of age, and\n10\n% of their eligible compensation on an after-tax basis, all subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Company may make a basic matching contribution equal to\n50\n% of each eligible participant’s contribution that does not exceed\n6\n% of the eligible participant’s annual compensation in the year of contribution. Furthermore, the Company’s employer matching contributions vest immediately. Contributions, including the Company’s matching contribution to the Plan, are recorded as soon as administratively possible after the Company makes payroll deductions from Plan participants.\nEffective February 18, 2023, the Company announced its decision to suspend its previous practice of matching contributions. The Company later resumed matching contributions effective January 1, 2024.\nFor 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company made Plan contributions of $\n13\nmillion, $\n22\nmillion and $\n36\nmillion, respectively.\n91\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 12.\nShareholders’ Equity and Convertible Preferred Stock\n2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan\nIn November 2021, stockholders approved the Western Digital Corporation 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan, (as amended and restated, the “2021 Plan”). Upon the effective date of the 2021 Plan, no new awards were granted under the Western Digital Corporation Amended and Restated 2017 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). The types of awards that may be granted under the 2021 Plan include stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), RSUs, PSUs, restricted stock and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company’s common stock or units of the Company’s common stock, as well as cash awards. Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2021 Plan include officers and employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, directors of the Company and certain consultants and advisors to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The vesting of awards under the 2021 Plan and the 2017 Plan is determined at the date of grant. Each award expires on a date determined at the date of grant; however, the maximum term of options and SARs is\nten years\nafter the grant date of the award. RSUs typically vest over periods ranging from\ntwo\nto\nfour years\nfrom the date of grant. PSUs are granted to certain employees and vest only after the achievement of pre-determined performance conditions or market conditions and completion of requisite service periods. Once the performance conditions or market conditions are met, the employee’s vesting of PSUs is generally subject to continued service.\nOutstanding RSU and PSU awards have dividend equivalent rights which entitle holders of such outstanding awards to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. Dividend equivalent rights are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs and PSUs. Dividend equivalent rights are accumulated and paid in additional shares when the underlying shares vest.\nAs of June 28, 2024, the maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that was authorized for award grants under the 2021 Plan was\n21.3\nmillion shares. The 2021 Plan will terminate on November 22, 2031, unless terminated earlier by the Company’s Board of Directors.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Company’s ESPP, eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to\n10\n% of their eligible compensation, subject to IRS limitations, during prescribed offering periods to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at\n95\n% of the fair market value of common stock either at the beginning of that offering period or on the applicable exercise date, whichever is less. A participant may participate in only\none\noffering period at a time, and a new offering period generally begins each June 1st and December 1st. Each offering period is generally\n24\nmonths and consists of\nfour\nexercise dates (each, generally\nsix months\nfollowing the start of the offering period or the preceding exercise date, as the case may be). If the fair market value of the Company’s common stock is less on a given exercise date than on the date of grant, employee participation in that offering period ends and participants are automatically re-enrolled in the next new offering period.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued\n2.4\nmillion,\n2.7\nmillion and\n2.1\nmillion shares, respectively, under the ESPP for aggregate purchase amounts of $\n81\nmillion, $\n92\nmillion and $\n113\nmillion, respectively.\nTo the extent available, the Company may issue shares out of treasury stock upon the vesting of awards, the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the ESPP.\n92\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nThe following tables present the Company’s stock-based compensation for equity-settled awards by type and financial statement line as well as the related tax benefit included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nAny shortfalls or excess windfall tax benefits related to the vesting and exercise of stock-based awards, which are recognized as a component of the Company’s Income tax expense, were not material for the periods presented.\nCompensation cost related to unvested RSUs, PSUs and rights to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP will generally be amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining average service period.\nThe following table presents the unamortized compensation cost and weighted average service period of all unvested outstanding awards as of June 28, 2024:\n(1)\nWeighted average service period assumes the performance conditions are met for the PSUs.\n93\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nPlan Activities\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity under the Company’s incentive plans:\nNo\noptions were granted in 2024, 2023 or 2022. As of June 28, 2024, there were no remaining outstanding options.\nRSUs and PSUs\nThe following table summarizes RSU and PSU activity under the Company’s incentive plans:\nRSUs and PSUs are generally settled in an equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock at the time of vesting of the units.\n94\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nFair Value Valuation Assumptions\nRSU and PSU Grants\nThe fair value of the Company’s RSU and PSU awards with a performance condition is determined based upon the closing price of the Company’s stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of PSU awards with a market condition is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.\nESPP – Black-Scholes-Merton Model\nThe fair value of ESPP purchase rights issued is estimated at the date of grant of the purchase rights using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires the input of assumptions such as the expected stock price volatility and the expected period until options are exercised. Purchase rights under the ESPP are generally granted on either June 1st or December 1st of each year.\nThe fair values of ESPP purchase rights have been estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nOn January 31, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the designation of\n900,000\nshares of Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share (the “Preferred Shares”), from the Company’s existing\nfive million\nauthorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and issued the Preferred Shares through a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of $\n900\nmillion, less issuance costs of $\n24\nmillion. During the year ended June 28, 2024,\n665,000\nof the Preferred Shares were converted into approximately\n15\nmillion shares of common stock in accordance with the original term of the agreement. As of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023,\n235,000\nand\n900,000\nof the Preferred Shares were outstanding, respectively.\nDividend provisions\nThe Preferred Shares have a stated value of $\n1,000\nper share and accrue a cumulative preferred dividend at an annual rate of\n6.25\n% per annum (increasing to\n7.25\n% per annum on January 31, 2030 and to\n8.25\n% per annum on January 31, 2033) compounded on a quarterly basis. The Preferred Shares also participate in any dividends declared for common shareholders on an as-converted equivalent basis. No dividends have been declared or paid since the issuance of the Preferred Shares. As of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, unpaid and undeclared cumulative dividends payable with respect to the Preferred Shares were $\n22\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion, respectively.\nDuring the year ended June 28, 2024, $\n56\nmillion in unpaid and undeclared cumulative dividends payable were included in the aggregate liquidation preference of the\n665,000\nof the Preferred Shares that were converted into approximately\n15\nmillion shares of common stock, as noted above.\n95\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nConversion rights\nThe Preferred Shares are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion rate of $\n47.75\nper share (the “Conversion Price”) (subject to anti-dilution adjustments and certain other one-time adjustments upon the occurrence of various specified spin-off transactions) applied to the aggregate sum of the stated value of the Preferred Shares plus any cumulative accrued but unpaid dividends (the “Accumulated Stated Value”). In the event of a standalone spin-off transaction, the holders of the Preferred Shares may have one third of their Preferred Shares converted to a similar class of preferred shares of the spin-off entity. The Preferred Shares will be convertible at the option of the Company after January 31, 2026 if the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds\n150\n% of the Conversion Price for at least\n20\nout of\n30\nconsecutive trading days immediately prior to the Company’s conversion notice.\nAs of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Preferred Shares outstanding would have been convertible, if otherwise permitted, into\n5\nmillion and\n19\nmillion shares of common stock, respectively.\nRedemption\nAfter January 31, 2030, the Company will have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem the Preferred Shares for an amount in cash equal to\n110\n% of the Accumulated Stated Value. Redemption is contingently mandatory in the event of a fundamental change in the business as defined in the designation of the Preferred Shares.\nThe Preferred Shares has been classified as mezzanine equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets because, in the event of certain fundamental change in the business that are not solely within the control of the Company, the Preferred Shares would become redeemable at the option of the holders. The Company did not adjust the carrying values of the Preferred Shares to the current redemption value of such shares since a liquidation event was not probable at any of the balance sheet dates. Subsequent adjustments to increase or decrease the carrying values to the ultimate redemption value will be made only if and when it becomes probable that such a fundamental change in the business will occur.\nVoting right\nThe Preferred Shares will vote, to the extent permitted under the Nasdaq listing rules, on an as-converted equivalent basis along with holders of the Company’s common stock.\nLiquidation preference\nIn the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, holders of the Preferred Shares will be senior to the holders of the Company’s common stock and the liquidation preference is the greater of (i) the sum of an amount in cash equal to\n110\n% of the Accumulated Stated Value plus accrued and unpaid dividends and (ii) the payment that the holders of the Preferred Shares would have received had all the Preferred Shares been converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, before any distributions are made to common shareholders and all other classes of junior capital stock of the Company. As of June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the total aggregate liquidation preference was $\n257\nmillion and $\n924\nmillion, respectively.\nStock Reserved for Issuance\nThe following table summarizes all common stock reserved for issuance at June 28, 2024:\n96\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nDividends to Shareholders\nThe Company issued a quarterly cash dividend from the first quarter of 2013 up to the third quarter of 2020. In April 2020, the Company suspended its dividend to reinvest in the business and to support its ongoing deleveraging efforts\n.\n97\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 13.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome (Loss) Before Taxes\nThe domestic and foreign components of Income (loss) before taxes were as follows:\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe components of the income tax expense were as follows:\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses. The Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Act during the second quarter of 2019. However, the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Services (“IRS”) have issued tax guidance on certain provisions of the 2017 Act since the enactment date, and the Company anticipates the issuance of additional regulatory and interpretive guidance. The Company applied a reasonable interpretation of the 2017 Act along with the then-available guidance in finalizing its accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Act. Any additional regulatory or interpretive guidance would constitute new information, which may require further refinements to the Company’s estimates in future periods.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained significant law changes related to tax, climate, energy and health care. The tax measures include, among other things, a corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) of 15% on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) exceeding $1.00 billion. The corporate alternative minimum tax is effective for the Company beginning with 2024. The Company is not subject to the CAMT of 15% for fiscal year 2024 as its average annual AFSI did not exceed $1.00 billion for the preceding three-year period.\n98\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nDeferred Taxes\nTemporary differences and carryforwards, which give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nThe increase in the deferred tax assets is attributable primarily to the IRS interest payments made in connection with the notice of deficiency received for years 2008 through 2011 that are not currently deductible under\n§\n163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the unamortized original issue discount (“OID”) related to the premium paid to purchase Capped Calls in connection with the offering of the 2028 Convertible Notes. As described in Note 7,\nDebt\n, the deferred tax asset related to the unamortized OID was recorded as a decrease to Additional paid-in capital. The assessment of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets requires estimations and significant judgment. The Company continues to assess and adjust its valuation allowance based on operating results and market conditions. After weighing both the positive and negative evidence available, including, but not limited to, earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets, the Company determined that it is able to realize its deferred tax assets except for certain loss and credit carryforwards.\nThe Company is permanently reinvested with respect to certain foreign earnings. There is no unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of these foreign undistributed earnings as it can be achieved without additional federal tax consequences.\n99\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nEffective Tax Rate\nReconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:\nTax Holidays and Carryforwards\nA substantial portion of the Company’s manufacturing operations in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand operate under various tax holidays and tax incentive programs, which will expire in whole or in part at various dates during 2025 through 2031. Certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs may be extended if specific conditions are met. On November 1, 2023, one of the Company’s tax holidays in Malaysia expired. The Company has applied for an extension and anticipates this extension, if granted, will be applied retroactively and begin on November 2, 2023. Because the exact terms of the extension are not currently known, the Company is applying the Malaysia corporate statutory tax rate on the expired tax holiday income. If a retroactive extension is granted, the Company will make an adjustment to its effective tax rate in that period.\nThe net impact of these tax holidays and tax incentives was an increase to the Company’s net earnings by $\n209\nmillion, or $\n0.64\nper diluted share, $\n140\nmillion, or $\n0.44\nper diluted share, and $\n566\nmillion, or $\n1.79\nper diluted share, in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of June 28, 2024, the Company had varying amounts of federal and state NOL/tax credit carryforwards that do not expire or, if not used, expire in various years.\nFollowing is a summary of the Company’s federal and state NOL/tax credit carryforwards and the related expiration dates of these NOL/tax credit carryforwards:\n100\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe federal and state NOLs and credits relating to various acquisitions are subject to limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company expects the total amount of federal and state NOLs ultimately realized will be reduced as a result of these provisions by $\n116\nmillion and $\n240\nmillion, respectively. The Company expects the total amount of federal and state credits ultimately realized will be reduced as a result of these provisions by $\n27\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of June 28, 2024, the Company had varying amounts of foreign NOL carryforwards that do not expire or, if not used, expire in various years, depending on the country.\nThe major jurisdictions that the Company receives foreign NOL carryforwards and the related amounts and expiration dates of these NOL carryforwards are as follows:\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWith the exception of certain unrecognized tax benefits that are directly associated with the tax position taken, unrecognized tax benefits are presented gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits excluding accrued interest and penalties:\nAs of June 28, 2024, June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, the portion of the gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would affect the effective tax rate is $\n555\nmillion, $\n855\nmillion and $\n903\nmillion, respectively. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties included in the Company’s liability related to unrecognized tax benefits as of June 28, 2024, June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 was $\n181\nmillion, $\n289\nmillion and $\n254\nmillion, respectively. As of June 28, 2024, June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, the Company’s payables related to unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, were $\n736\nmillion, $\n1.14\nbillion and $\n1.16\nbillion, respectively. Of these amounts, the Company believes it is reasonably likely that payments of $\n185\nmillion may be made within the next twelve months and have classified that portion of these unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, in Income taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 28, 2024. The remaining payables related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 28, 2024, June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022.\n101\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, U.S. state and foreign tax returns. For both federal and state tax returns, with few exceptions, the Company is subject to examination for 2016 through 2023. The Company is no longer subject to examination by the IRS for periods prior to 2016, although carry forwards generated prior to those periods may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS or state taxing authority if they either have been or will be used in a subsequent period.\nIn the following major foreign jurisdictions where there is no tax holiday, the Company could be subject to examination as noted below:\nThe Company had previously reached a final agreement with the IRS regarding notices of deficiency with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and in February 2024, reached a final agreement for resolving the notices of proposed adjustments with respect to years 2013 through 2015. During 2024, the Company made payments of $\n363\nmillion for tax and $\n161\nmillion for interest with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and recognized adjustments to align with IRS calculations, resulting in a remaining liability of $\n185\nmillion related to all years from 2008 through 2015. The Company expects to pay any remaining balance with respect to this matter within the next twelve months.\nIn connection with settlements for the years 2008 through 2015, the Company expects to realize reductions to its mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations and tax savings from interest deductions in future years aggregating to $\n165\nmillion. Of this amount, $\n34\nmillion of the interest savings from the interest paid with respect to years 2008 through 2012 is classified as a deferred tax asset due to interest expense limitation rules.\nThe Company believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from any other tax examinations. However, the outcome of such tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax examinations are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. As of June 28, 2024, with the exception of the final agreement with the IRS, it was not possible to estimate the amount of change, if any, in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months. Any significant change in the amount of the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information relating to the examination of the Company’s tax returns.\n102\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 14.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Common Share\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted income (loss) per common share:\nBasic income (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders is computed using (i) net income (loss) less (ii) dividends paid to holders of Preferred Shares less (iii) net income (loss) attributable to participating securities divided by (iv) weighted average basic shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders is computed as (i) basic net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders plus (ii) diluted adjustments to income allocable to participating securities divided by (iii) weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The \"if-converted\" method is used to determine the dilutive impact for the convertible notes and the Preferred Shares. The treasury stock method is used to determine the dilutive impact of unvested equity awards.\nFor 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a net loss and all shares subject to outstanding equity awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted shares for the period because their impact would have been anti-dilutive. For 2022, the Company excluded common shares subject to certain outstanding equity awards from the calculation of diluted shares because their impact would have been anti-dilutive based on the Company’s average stock price during those periods.\n103\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 15.\nEmployee Termination, Asset Impairment, and Other\nBusiness Realignment\nThe Company periodically incurs charges to realign its operations with anticipated market demand, primarily consisting of organization rationalization designed to streamline its business, reduce its cost structure and focus its resources. The Company may also record credits related to gains upon sale of property in connection with these activities. In this regard, in 2024, the Company reassessed existing capacity development plans and made a decision to cancel certain projects, including projects to expand capacity in its Penang, Malaysia facility, resulting in the impairment of existing construction in progress, other assets and the recognition of a liability for certain contract termination costs. The Company has also taken actions to reduce the amount of capital invested in facilities, including the sale-leaseback of its facility in Milpitas, California in 2024.\nThe Company recorded the following charges related to these actions:\nThe following table presents an analysis of the components of these activities against the reserve during the year ended June 28, 2024:\n104\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 16.\nSupplier Finance Program\nThe Company maintains a voluntary supplier finance program that provides participating suppliers with enhanced receivable options. The program allows participating suppliers of the Company, at their sole discretion and cost, to sell their receivables due from the Company to a third-party financial institution and receive early payment at terms negotiated between the supplier and the third-party financial institution. The Company’s vendor payment terms and amounts are not impacted by a supplier’s decision to participate in this program.\nThe Company’s current payment terms with its suppliers under these programs generally range from\n60\nto\n90\ndays and payment terms that the Company negotiates with its suppliers are not impacted by whether a supplier participates in the program. The Company does not provide any guarantees to any third parties and no assets are pledged in connection with the arrangements.\nThe Company’s outstanding payment obligations to vendors eligible to participate under its supplier finance program were $\n37\nmillion and $\n38\nmillion as of  June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively, and are included within\nAccounts payable\non the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n105\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 17.\nLegal Proceedings\nTax\nFor disclosures regarding statutory notices of deficiency issued by the IRS on June 28, 2018 and December 10, 2018, and the status of resolution with respect to certain matters, see Note 13,\nIncome Tax Expense.\nIntellectual Property Litigation\nUnless otherwise stated, for each of the matters described below, the Company has either recorded an accrual for losses that are probable and reasonably estimable or has determined that, while a loss is reasonably possible (including potential losses in excess of the amounts accrued by the Company), a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible losses with respect to the claim or in excess of amounts already accrued by the Company cannot be made. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates.\nOn August 26, 2022, MR Technologies, GmbH (“MRT”) filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the “Central District Court”) against the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Western Digital Technologies, Inc., alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,978,413, 9,928,864, 11,133,031 and 11,138,997, each of which relate to hard disk drive media. As the case progressed, MRT dropped its claims with respect to U.S Patent Nos. 9,978,413 and 11,133,031, and the case proceeded to trial on the remaining\ntwo\npatents (together, the “MRT Patents”). The trial commenced on July 16, 2024 and concluded on July 26, 2024, and the jury awarded MRT a lump sum of $\n262\nmillion for use of the MRT Patents in the past and through their remaining lives. MRT also requested and was awarded prejudgment interest totaling $\n117\nmillion in a judgment entered on August 15, 2024. We anticipate that MRT will also request costs, attorney’s fees and post-judgment interest. The Company has recognized an aggregate liability for this matter of $\n384\nmillion within Accrued expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 28, 2024. Of this amount, $\n291\nmillion was recognized as Litigation matter under Operating expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended June 28, 2024 and $\n93\nmillion recognized within Other non-current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 28, 2024, to be amortized over the remaining lives of the MRT Patents. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses, plans to file post-trial motions, and if not successful, plans to appeal the judgment and continue to defend itself vigorously.\nOn September 28, 2016, SPEX Technologies, Inc. (“SPEX”) filed a lawsuit in the Central District Court against the Company and two of the Company’s current or former wholly-owned subsidiaries, Western Digital Technologies, Inc. and HGST Inc., alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,088,802 and 6,003,135, both of which allegedly relate to moving a security mechanism (e.g., the encrypting/decrypting mechanism) from a host computer or a separate device to a peripheral device that provides data storage. As the case progressed, SPEX dismissed its allegations relating to U.S. Patent No. 6,003,135 and narrowed its case to three claims under U.S. Patent No. 6,088,802 asserted against certain HDD products that may include certain encryption capabilities. Trial is scheduled to commence on October 8, 2024, and the Company intends to defend itself vigorously.\nOther Matters\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these other matters is subject to many uncertainties, management believes that any monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these matters, individually and in the aggregate, would not be material to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, any monetary liability and financial impact to the Company from these matters could differ materially from management’s expectations.\n106\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 18.\nRevision of Previously Issued Financial Statements\nAs described in Note 1, in connection with the preparation of its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended December 29, 2023, the Company identified certain errors related to the Company’s reporting and recording of its interests in its equity method investments in Flash Ventures. These errors related to unadjusted differences between the Flash Ventures’ application of Japanese generally accepted accounting principles to certain lease-related transactions compared to the applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These unadjusted differences resulted in differences in the equity in earnings from these entities recognized by the Company in Other income (expense), net and the carrying value of the Company’s equity method investments in Flash Ventures.\nThe following tables provide a summary of the revisions made to the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented.\n107\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n108\nWESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n109"

Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nOur management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, which audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting. See Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 28, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations of Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n110"
