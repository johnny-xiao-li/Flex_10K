    "text": "General\nHenry Schein, Inc. is a solutions company for health care professionals powered\nby a network of people and\ntechnology.\nWe believe we are the world’s largest\nprovider of health care products and services primarily to\noffice-\nbased dental and medical practitioners, as well as alternate sites of care.\nOur philosophy is grounded in our\ncommitment to help customers operate a more efficient and successful business so\nthe practitioner can provide\nbetter clinical care.\nWith more than 91 years of experience distributing health care products, we have built a vast set of small,\nmid-sized\nand large customers in the dental and medical markets, serving more than one million\ncustomers worldwide across\ndental practices, laboratories,\nphysician practices, and ambulatory surgery centers, as well as government,\ninstitutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.\nWe are headquartered in Melville, New York\nand employ more than 25,000 people.\nApproximately 55% of our\nworkforce is based in the United States and approximately 45% is based outside\nof the United States.\nWe have\noperations or affiliates in 33 countries and territories.\nOur broad global footprint has evolved over time through our\norganic success as well as through contribution from strategic acquisitions.\nWe stock a comprehensive selection of more than 300,000 branded products and Henry Schein corporate brand\nproducts through our main distribution centers.\nOur infrastructure, including over 5.3 million square feet of space\nin 36 strategically located distribution and 22 manufacturing facilities around\nthe world, enables us to historically\nprovide rapid and accurate order fulfillment, better serve our customers and\nincrease our operating efficiency.\nThis\ninfrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive\nprices, and a strong commitment to\ncustomer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’\nneeds.\nWe conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and\nvalue-added services.\nThese segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.\nOur dental\nbusinesses serve office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools, government\nand other\ninstitutions.\nOur medical businesses serve physician offices, urgent care centers, ambulatory care sites,\nemergency\nmedical technicians, dialysis centers, home health, federal and state governments\nand large enterprises, such as\ngroup practices and integrated delivery networks, among other providers\nacross a wide range of specialties.\nThe health care distribution reportable segment, combining our global dental\nand medical operating segments,\ndistributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment\nrepair services,\nbranded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, dental specialty\nproducts (including implant,\northodontic and endodontic products), diagnostic tests, infection-control products,\npersonal protective equipment\nproducts (“PPE”) and vitamins.\nWhile our primary go-to-market strategy is in our capacity as a\ndistributor, we also\nmarket and sell under our own corporate brand portfolio of cost-effective, high-quality consumable\nmerchandise\nproducts, and manufacture certain dental specialty products in the areas of oral\nsurgery, implants, orthodontics and\nendodontics.\nThe technology and value-added services reportable segment provides\nsoftware, technology and other value-added\nservices to health care practitioners.\nHenry Schein One, the largest contributor of sales to this category, offers\ndental practice management solutions for dental and medical practitioners.\nIn addition, we offer dentists and\nphysicians a broad suite of electronic health records, patient communication\nservices including electronic marketing\nand website design, analytics and patient demand generation.\nOur value-added practice solutions include practice\nconsultancy, education, integrated revenue cycle management and the facilitation of financial service offerings (on\na non-recourse basis) to help dentists and physicians operate and expand\ntheir business operations,\ne-services,\npractice technology, network and hardware services, as well as consulting, and continuing education services for\npractitioners.\nWe believe our hands-on consultative approach to provide solutions to support practice decision-\nmaking is a key differentiator for our business.\n4\nRecent Developments\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent\nDevelopments” herein for a discussion related to recent Company developments.\nIndustry\nThe global health care distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and\ndiverse.\nThe industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of\nrelatively small offices to mid-sized and large\ngroup practices ranging in size from a few practitioners to several\nhundred practices owned or operated by dental\nsupport organizations (“DSOs”), medical group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), hospital\nsystems or integrated\ndelivery networks.\nDue in part to the limited capacity of office-based health care practitioners\nto store and manage large quantities of\nsupplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment\nto office-based health care\npractitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders,\nand a need for rapid, reliable and\nsubstantially complete order fulfillment.\nThe purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice\nare\ntypically made by the practitioner, hygienist or office manager.\nSupplies and small equipment are generally\npurchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.\nThe health care distribution industry continues to experience growth due\nto demand driven by the aging population,\nincreased health care awareness and the importance of preventative care,\nan increasing understanding of the\nconnection between good oral health and overall health, improved access\nto care globally, the proliferation of\nmedical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and\nexpanded third-party insurance coverage,\npartially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage and technological\nimprovements, including\nthe advancement of software and services, prosthetic solutions and telemedicine.\nIn addition, the non-acute market\ncontinues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic\ntesting from acute care settings to alternate-care\nsites, particularly physicians’ offices and ambulatory surgery centers.\nWe believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly\nthose with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking\nto combine with larger companies that can\nprovide growth opportunities.\nThis consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking\nto acquire\ncompanies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide\nopportunities to serve a broader\ncustomer base.\nIn addition, customer consolidation will likely lead to multiple locations\nunder common management and the\nmovement of more procedures from the hospital setting to the physician\nor alternate care setting as the health care\nindustry is increasingly focused on efficiency and cost containment.\nThis trend has benefited distributors capable\nof providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.\nIt also has accelerated the growth of health\nmaintenance organizations (“HMOs”), group practices, other managed care accounts\nand collective buying groups,\nwhich, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive\nprices, tend to favor distributors capable\nof providing specialized management information support.\nWe believe that the trend towards cost containment has\nthe potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software,\nwhich can enhance the\nefficiency and facilitation of practice management.\nCompetition\nThe distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is\nhighly competitive.\nMany of the health\ncare products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers.\nIn addition, our competitors could\nobtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products.\nManufacturers also could seek to sell\ndirectly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and\nthat of other distributors.\nIn certain parts of the\ndental end market, such as those related to dental specialty products, and\nmedical end market manufacturers already\nsell directly to end customers.\nIn North America, we compete with other distributors, as well as several\nmanufacturers, of dental and medical\nproducts, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, e-commerce\ncapabilities, customer service and\n5\nvalue-added products and services.\nIn the dental market, our primary competitors in the U.S. are the Patterson\nDental division of Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply\nCompany.\nIn addition, we compete against\na number of other distributors that operate on a national, regional and\nlocal level.\nOur primary competitors in the\nU.S. medical market, which accounts for the large majority of our global medical\nsales, are McKesson Corporation\nand Medline Industries, Inc., which are national distributors.\nWe also compete with a number of regional and local\nmedical distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers that\nsell directly to physicians and patients in their\nhomes.\nWith regard to our dental software, we compete against numerous companies, including the Patterson\nDental division of Patterson Companies, Inc., Carestream Health, Inc.,\nCarestream Dental LLC, Centaur Software\nDevelopment Co Pty Ltd. (d.b.a. dental4windows, dental4web), Open Dental\nSoftware, Inc., PlanetDDS LLC,\nGood Methods Global Inc. (d.b.a. CareStack) and Curve Dental, LLC.\nIn other software end markets, including\nrevenue cycle management, patient relationship management and patient\ndemand generation, we compete with\ncompanies such as Vyne Therapeutics Inc., EDI-Health Group, Inc. (d.b.a. Dental X Change, Inc.), Weave\nCommunications, Inc., and Solutionreach, Inc.\nThe medical practice management and electronic medical\nrecords\nmarket is fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such\nas the NextGen division of Quality Systems,\nInc., eClinicalWorks, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and Epic Systems Corporation.\nOutside of the U.S., we believe we are the only global distributor of supplies\nand equipment to dental practices and\nour competitors are primarily local and regional companies.\nWe also face significant competition internationally,\nwhere we compete on the basis of price and customer service against\nseveral large competitors, including the\nGACD Group, Proclinic SA, Lifco AB, Planmeca Oy and Billericay Dental\nSupply Co. Ltd., as well as a large\nnumber of other dental and medical product distributors and manufacturers\nin international countries and territories\nwe serve.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe have more than 91 years of experience in distributing products to health care practitioners resulting in strong\nawareness of the Henry Schein\n®\nbrand.\nOur competitive strengths include:\nA focus on meeting our customers’ unique needs\n.\nWe are committed to providing customized solutions to our\ncustomers that are driven by our understanding of the end markets we\nserve and reflect the

well as through the acquisition\nof new\nproducts and services that may help us better serve our customers.\nDirect sales and marketing expertise.\nOur sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify\ncustomer relationships through personal or virtual visits by field sales representatives,\nfrequent direct marketing and\ntelesales contact, emphasizing our broad product lines, including exclusive\ndistribution agreements, competitive\nprices and ease of order placement,\nparticularly through our e-commerce platforms.\nThe key elements of our direct\nsales and marketing efforts are:\n•\nField sales consultants.\nOur field sales consultants, including equipment sales specialists, covering\nmajor\nNorth American, European and other international markets.\nThese consultants complement our direct\nmarketing and telesales efforts and enable us to better market, service and support\nthe sale of more\nsophisticated products and equipment.\n•\nMarketing.\nWe market to existing and prospective office-based health care providers through a\ncombination of owned, earned and paid digital channels, tradeshows, as well\nas through catalogs, flyers,\ndirect mail and other promotional materials.\nOur strategies include an emphasis on educational content\nthrough webinars and content marketing initiatives.\nWe continue to enhance our marketing technology to\nimprove our targeting capability and the relevance of messaging and offers.\n•\nTelesales.\nWe support our direct marketing effort with inbound and outbound telesales representatives,\nwho facilitate order processing, generate new sales through direct and frequent\ncontact with customers and\nstay abreast of market developments and the hundreds of new

and\ncompetitive e-commerce solutions.\nWe continue to invest in our e-commerce platform to offer enhanced\ncontent management so customers can more easily find the products\nthey need and to enable an engaging\npurchase experience, supported by excellent customer service.\n•\nSocial media.\nOur operating entities and employees engage our customers and\nsupplier partners through\nvarious social media platforms, which are an important element of our\ncommunications and marketing\nefforts.\nWe continue to expand our social media presence to raise awareness about issues, engage\ncustomers beyond a sale and deliver services and solutions to specialized\naudiences.\nBroad product and service offerings at competitive prices.\nWe offer\na broad range of products and services to our\ncustomers, at competitive prices, in the following categories:\n•\nConsumable supplies and equipment\n.\nWe distribute consumable products, small equipment, laboratory\nproducts, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals,\nvaccines, dental\nspecialty products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.\nWe stock a comprehensive\nselection of more than 300,000 branded products and Henry Schein\ncorporate brand products through our\nmain distribution centers.\nWe also market and sell our own corporate brand portfolio of cost-effective, high-\nquality consumable merchandise products and manufacture certain\ndental specialty products in the areas of\nimplants, orthodontics and endodontics.\n•\nTechnology and other value-added products and services.\nWe sell practice management, business\nanalytics, patient engagement and patient demand creation software solutions\nto our dental customers.\nOur\npractice management solutions provide practitioners with electronic\nmedical records, patient treatment\nhistory, analytics, billing, accounts receivable analyses and management, appointment calendars, electronic\nclaims processing and word processing programs, network and hardware\nservices, e-commerce and\nelectronic marketing services, sourcing third party patient payment plans,\ntransition services and training\nand education programs for practitioners.\nWe also sell medical software for practice management, certified\nelectronic health records (“EHR”) and e-Prescribe medications and prescription\nsolutions.\nWe have\ntechnical representatives supporting customers using our practice management\nsolutions and services.\nAs\nof December 30, 2023, we had an active user base of approximately 110,000 practices and 350,000\nconsumers, including users of AxiUm, Dentally®, Dentrix Ascend®, Dental\nVision®, Dentrix® Dental\nSystems, Dentrix® Enterprise, Easy Dental®, EndoVision®, Evolution® and EXACT®, Gesden®,

installation and technical services for our health care customers.\nOur technicians provide\ninstallation and repair services for dental handpieces,\ndental and medical small equipment,\ntable-top\nsterilizers and large dental equipment.\n•\nFinancial services.\nWe offer our customers solutions in operating their practices more efficiently by\nproviding access to a number of financial services and products\nprovided by third party suppliers (including\nnon-recourse financing for equipment, technology and software\nproducts, non-recourse practice financing\nfor leasehold improvements, business debt consolidation and commercial\nreal estate, non-recourse patient\nfinancing and credit card processing) at rates that we believe are generally\nlower than what our customers\nwould be able to secure independently.\nWe also provide staffing services, dental practice valuation and\nbrokerage services.\nCommitment to superior customer service\n.\nWe maintain a strong commitment to providing superior customer\nservice.\nWe frequently monitor our customer service through customer surveys, focus groups and statistical\nreports.\nOur customer service policy primarily focuses on:\n•\nExceptional order fulfillment\n.\nWe ship an average of approximately 141,000 cartons daily.\n7\n•\nComprehensive ordering process\n.\nCustomers may place orders 24 hours a

centralized\nmanagement of key functions, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, purchasing,\nsales, order fulfillment and financial and operational reporting.\nThese systems allow us to manage our growth,\ndeliver superior customer service, properly target customers, manage financial\nperformance and monitor daily\noperational statistics.\nCost-effective

fulfillment.\nProducts and Services\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales\nby principal categories of products and\nservices offered through our health care distribution and technology and value-added services\nreportable segments:\nDecember 30,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 25,\n2023\n2022\n2021\nHealth care distribution:\nDental

and digital restoration equipment.\n(2)\nIncludes branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products, X-ray\nproducts, equipment, PPE products and vitamins.\n(3)\nConsists of practice management software and other value-added products, which are distributed primarily to health care providers,\nand financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, continuing education services for practitioners, consulting and other\nservices.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur mission is to provide innovative, integrated health care products and\nservices; and to be trusted advisors and\nconsultants to our customers - enabling them to deliver the best quality patient\ncare and enhance their practice\nmanagement efficiency and profitability.\nOur BOLD+1 Strategic Plan consists of the following:\n•\nBuild (“B”)\nComplementary software, specialty, and services businesses for high growth\n•\nOperationalize (“O”)\nOne Distribution to deliver exceptional customer experience, increased\nefficiency,\nand growth\n•\nLeverage (“L”)\nOne Schein to broaden and deepen relationships with our customers\n•\nDrive (“D”)\nDrive digital transformation for our customers and for Henry Schein\n•\n+1\nCreate Value\nfor our stakeholders\n8\nTo accomplish this, we apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:\n•\nIncrease penetration of our existing customer base.\nWe have over one million customers worldwide and\nwe intend to increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance\nour position as their primary\nsupplier.\nWe believe our offering of a broad range of products, services and support, including software\nsolutions that can help drive improved workflow efficiency and patient communications\nfor practices,\ncoupled with our full-service value proposition, helps us to retain and grow\nour customer base.\n•\nIncrease the number of customers we serve.\nThis strategy includes increasing the productivity of our field\nsales consultants and telesales team, as well as using our customer\ndatabase to focus our marketing efforts\nin all of our operating segments.\nIn the dental business, we provide products and services to\nindependent\npractices, mid-market groups, and large DSOs as well as community health centers\nand government sites of\ncare.\nLeveraging our broad array of assets and capabilities, we offer solutions to address these\nnew\nmarkets.\nIn the medical business, we have expanded to serve customers\nlocated in settings outside of the\ntraditional office, such as urgent care clinics, retail, occupational health and home health settings.\nAs\nsettings of health care shift, we remain committed to serving these practitioners\nand providing them with\nthe products and services they need.\n•\nLeverage our value-added products and services.\nWe continue to increase cross-selling efforts for key\nproduct lines utilizing a consultative selling process.\nIn the dental business, we have significant cross-\nselling opportunities between our dental software users and our dental customers.\nIn the medical business,\nwe have opportunities to expand our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals\nsales to health care\npractitioners, as well as cross-selling EHR systems and software\nwhen we sell our core products.\nOur\nstrategy extends to providing health systems, integrated delivery networks\nand other large group and multi-\nsite health care organizations, including physician clinics, these same value added\nproducts and services.\nAs physicians and health systems closely align, we have increased\naccess to opportunities for cross-\nmarketing and selling our product and service portfolios.\n•\nPursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.\nOur acquisition strategy is focused on investments in\ncompanies that add new customers and sales teams, increase our geographic\nfootprint (whether entering a\nnew country, such as emerging markets, or building scale where we have already invested in businesses),\nand finally, those that enable us to access new products and technologies.\nMarkets Served\nDemographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an\naging U.S. population is increasingly using health\ncare services.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database, between 2023 and 2033, the 45 and\nolder population is expected to grow by approximately 11%.\nBetween 2023 and 2043, this age group is expected to\ngrow by approximately 21%.\nThis compares with expected total U.S. population growth\nrates of approximately 6%\nbetween 2023 and 2033 and approximately 11% between 2023 and 2043.\nIn the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45-and-older segment of\nthe population increases.\nThere is increasing demand for new technologies that allow\ndentists to increase\nproductivity, and this is being driven in the U.S. by lower insurance reimbursement rates.\nAt the same time, there is\nan expected increase in dental insurance coverage.\nIn the medical market, there continues to be a migration of procedures from\nacute-care settings to physicians’\noffices and home health settings, a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities\nfor us.\nThere also is the\ncontinuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care\nsettings.\nWe believe we have\nestablished a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician\npractitioner.\nWe support our dental and medical professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through\nimportant value-added services, including practice management software,\nelectronic claims processing, financial\nservices and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s\nefficiency.\n9\nAdditionally, we seek to expand our dental full-service model and medical offerings in countries where\nopportunities exist.\nWe do this through both direct sales and by partnering with local distribution and\nmanufacturing companies.\nFor information on revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see\nof “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nSeasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results\nWe experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.\nAs a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of\nsecurities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price\nto decline.\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.\nSales and profitability generally have been\nhigher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal\nproducts (including influenza vaccine),\npurchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners for certain products (including\nequipment and\nsoftware) and year-end promotions.\nSales and profitability may also be impacted by the timing of\ncertain annual\nand biennial dental tradeshows where equipment promotions are offered.\nIn addition, some dental practices delay\nequipment purchases in the U.S. until year-end due to tax incentives.\nWe expect our historical seasonality of sales\nto continue in the foreseeable future.\nGovernmental Regulations\nWe\nstrive to be compliant in all material respects with the applicable\nlaws, regulations and guidance described\nbelow, and believe we have effective compliance programs and other controls in place to ensure substantial\ncompliance.\nHowever, compliance is not guaranteed either now or in the future, as certain laws, regulations and\nguidance may be subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could\naffect our ability to comply, as well as\nfuture changes, additions and enforcement approaches, including political changes.\nWhen we discover situations of\nnon-compliance we seek to remedy them and bring the affected area back into compliance.\nPresident Biden’s\nadministration (the “Biden Administration”) has indicated that it will be\nmore aggressive in its pursuit of alleged\nviolations of law, and has revoked certain guidance that would have limited governmental use of informal agency\nguidance to pursue potential violations, and has stated that it is more prepared\nto pursue individuals for corporate\nlaw violations, including an aggressive approach to anti-corruption activities.\nFederal, state and certain foreign\ngovernments have also increased enforcement activity in the health care\nsector, particularly in areas of fraud and\nabuse, anti-bribery and corruption, controlled substances handling,\nmedical device regulations and data privacy and\nsecurity standards.\nChanges to applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below, as well as related administrative or judicial\ninterpretations, may require us to update or revise our operations, services,\nmarketing practices and compliance\nprograms and controls, and may impose additional and unforeseen costs\non us, pose new or previously immaterial\nrisks to us, or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment\nCertain of our businesses involve the distribution, manufacturing, importation,\nexportation, marketing, sale and\npromotion of pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices, and in this regard, we\nare subject to extensive local, state,\nfederal and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including as applicable\nto our wholesale distribution of\npharmaceuticals and medical devices, manufacturing activities, and as part of\nour specialty home medical supply\nbusinesses that distribute and sell medical equipment and supplies directly\nto patients.\nFederal, state and certain\nforeign governments have also increased enforcement activity in the health care\nsector, particularly in areas of fraud\nand abuse, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, controlled substances handling,\nmedical device regulations and data\nprivacy and security standards.\nCertain of our businesses involve pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices,\nincluding in vitro diagnostic devices,\nthat are paid for by third parties and must operate in compliance with a variety of\nburdensome and complex coding,\nbilling and record-keeping requirements in order to substantiate claims for\npayment under federal, state and\ncommercial healthcare reimbursement programs.\n10\nGovernment and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care,\nand there have\nbeen efforts to limit such private and government insurance programs, including efforts, thus far\nunsuccessful, to\nseek repeal of the entire United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\nas amended by the Health Care\nand Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010 (as amended,\nthe “ACA”).\nCertain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state,\nlocal and foreign laws and regulations,\nincluding with respect to the sale, transportation, importation, storage, handling\nand disposal of hazardous or\npotentially hazardous substances; “forever chemicals” such as per-and\npolyfluoroalkyl substances; and safe\nworking conditions.\nIn addition, activities to control medical costs, including laws and regulations\nlowering\nreimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, medical supplies\nand/or medical treatments or services,\nare ongoing.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) recently\nreleased the 2024 durable medical\nequipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (“DMEPOS”) reimbursement\nschedule, which, effective January 1,\n2024, reduced the DMEPOS reimbursement rates for non-rural suppliers,\nsuch as us, by removing the Coronavirus\nAid, Relief, and Economic Security (aka CARES) Act relief rates in effect during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis\nand other laws and regulations are subject to change and their evolving implementation\nmay impact our operations\nand our financial performance.\nOur businesses are generally subject to numerous laws and regulations that could\nimpact our financial performance,\nand failure to comply with such laws or regulations could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nOperating, Security and Licensure Standards\nCertain of our businesses are subject to local, state and federal governmental\nlaws and regulations relating to the\ndistribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and supplies.\nAmong the United States federal laws applicable\nto us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug,\nand Cosmetic Act, as amended (“FDC Act”),\nSection 361 of the Public Health Service Act and Section 401 of the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act of the Social\nSecurity Act, as well as laws regulating the billing of and reimbursement\nfrom government programs, such as\nMedicare and Medicaid, and from commercial payers.\nWe\nare also subject to comparable foreign regulations.\nThe FDC Act, the Controlled Substances Act, their implementing regulations,\nand similar foreign laws generally\nregulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, marketing and promotion,\nsampling, pricing and\nreimbursement, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, returning or recalling,\nreporting, and distribution of, and\nrecord keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states\nmay similarly\nregulate such activities within the state.\nFurthermore, Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides\nauthority to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable\ndiseases, serves as the legal basis for\nthe United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and\ntissue-based products, also known as “HCT/P products.”\nThe Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant\nchanges with respect to\npharmaceutical supply chain requirements.\nTitle II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act\n(“DSCSA”), was enacted in November 2013, and had a planned\n“phase in” schedule over a period of ten years,\nresulting in a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace\ncertain prescription drugs as they are\ndistributed in the United States that went into effect on November 27, 2023.\nThose DSCSA requirements that were\nscheduled to change on November 27, 2023, and include requiring trading partners\nto provide, receive and maintain\ndocumentation about products and ownership only “electronically”(and\nnot via paper) are now subject to a one-year\n“stabilization period” announced by FDA through two guidance documents\nin late August 2023.\nFDA is permitting\nthe stabilization period to accommodate an additional year, until November 27, 2024, to allow trading partners\nto\nimplement, troubleshoot and mature their electronic (versus paper), interoperable\nsystems, during which time the\nFDA does not intend to take action to enforce the requirements for the interoperable,\nelectronic, package level\nproduct tracing.\nAdditionally, the FDA announced that it does not intend to take action to enforce the portion of the\nFDC Act with respect to drug product that is introduced in a transaction into\ncommerce by the product’s\nmanufacturer or repackager before November 27, 2024, and for subsequent transactions\nof such product through the\nproduct’s expiry.\nFDA states this stabilization period is intended to avoid disruption\nto the supply chain, and\nensure continued patient access to drug products as trading partners\nmove towards full implementation of the\nDSCSA’s\nenhanced drug security requirements.\nThe law’s track and trace requirements applicable to\nmanufacturers, wholesalers, third-party logistics providers (e.g., trading partners),\nrepackagers and dispensers (e.g.,\n11\npharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect in January 2015, and, as stated, continues\nto be implemented.\nThe\nDSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree\nrequirements and pre-empt certain\nstate requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or\nin addition to, the DSCSA requirements.\nThe DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation\nof prescription drug wholesalers\nand third-party logistics providers (“3PLs”), and includes the eventual\ncreation of national wholesaler and 3PL\nlicenses in cases where states do not license such entities.\nThe DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs\ndistribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping,\nstorage and handling of\nprescription drugs.\nThe DSCSA requires wholesalers and 3PLs to submit annual reports\nto the FDA, which include\ninformation regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name\nand address of each facility, and\ncontact information.\nAccording to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing\nany licensing requirements\nthat are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered\nby the standards established by federal\nlaw in this area.\nCurrent state licensing requirements concerning wholesalers will\nremain in effect until the FDA\nissues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA.\nFDA issued a proposed rule establishing wholesaler and 3PL\nnational standards for licensing and other requirements in February 2022,\nbut that rule has not yet been finalized.\nIn addition, with respect to our specialty home medical supply business, we\nare subject to certain state licensure\nlaws (including state pharmacy laws), and also certain accreditation standards,\nincluding to qualify for\nreimbursement from Medicare and other third-party payers.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and\nthe Food and Drug Administration Safety and\nInnovation Act of 2012 amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate\nregulations to implement a unique\ndevice identification (“UDI”) system for medical devices.\nThe UDI rule phased in the implementation of the UDI\nregulations, generally beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class\nIII medical devices) and ending with the\nlowest-risk devices.\nMost compliance dates were reached as of September 24, 2018, with\na final set of\nrequirements for low risk devices being reached on September 24, 2022, which\ncompleted the phase in.\nHowever,\nin May 2021, the FDA issued an enforcement policy stating that\nit does not intend to object to the use of legacy\nidentification numbers on device labels and packages for finished devices\nmanufactured and labeled prior to\nSeptember 24, 2023.\nThe UDI regulations require “labelers” to include unique device\nidentifiers (“UDIs”), with a\ncontent and format prescribed by the FDA and issued under a system operated\nby an FDA-accredited issuing\nagency, on the labels and packages of medical devices (including, but not limited to, certain software that qualifies\nas a medical device under FDA rules), and to directly mark certain devices\nwith UDIs.\nThe UDI regulations also\nrequire labelers to submit certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices\nto the FDA, much of which\ninformation is publicly available on an FDA database, the Global Unique Device\nIdentification Database.\nOn July\n22, 2022, the FDA posted the final guidance regarding the Global Unique Device\nIdentification Database called\nUnique Device Identification Policy Regarding Compliance Dates for Class\nI and Unclassified Devices, Direct\nMarketing, and Global Unique Device Identification Database Requirements\nfor Certain Devices.\nThe UDI\nregulations and subsequent FDA guidance regarding the UDI requirements provide\nfor certain exceptions,\nalternatives and time extensions.\nFor example, the UDI regulations include a general exception\nfor Class I devices\nexempt from the Quality System Regulation (other than record-keeping\nrequirements and complaint files).\nRegulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers, repackagers,\nreprocessors and relabelers that\ncause a device’s label to be applied or modified, with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed\nwithout any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain\nof our businesses.\nAs a distributor of controlled substances, we are required,\nunder the Controlled Substances Act, to obtain and renew\nannually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (“DEA”)\npermitting us to handle controlled substances.\nWe\nare also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements\nrelating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling, reporting, record-keeping\nand distribution of such drugs, in\naccordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations,\nand these requirements have been\nsubject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times.\nWe\nare subject to inspection by the DEA.\nCertain of\nour businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses\nwith, and comply with operating and security\nstandards of, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Health\nand Human Services (“HHS”), and\nvarious state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable\nforeign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies, depending on the type of\noperations and location of product\ndistribution, manufacturing or sale.\nThese businesses include those that distribute, manufacture, relabel, and/or\nrepackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P\nproducts, or own pharmacy\noperations, or install, maintain or repair equipment.\n12\nIn addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil\nand/or criminal penalties for the transfer of human organs, as defined in the regulations, for valuable\nconsideration,\nwhile generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred\nin their procurement, processing, storage and\ndistribution.\nWe\nare also subject to foreign government regulation of such products.\nThe DEA, the FDA and state\nregulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including\nthe ability to suspend or limit the\ndistribution of products by our distribution centers, seize or order the\nrecall of products and impose significant\ncriminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.\nForeign regulations subject\nus to similar foreign enforcement powers.\nEU Regulation of Medicinal and Dental Products\nEuropean Union (“EU”) member states regulate their own healthcare systems,\nas does EU law.\nThe latter regulates\ncertain matters, most notably medicinal products and medical devices.\nMedicinal products are defined, broadly, as\nsubstances or combinations of substances having certain functionalities and\nmay not include medical devices.\nEU\n“regulations” apply in all member states, whereas “directives” are implemented\nby the individual laws of member\nstates.\nOn medicines for humans, we are regulated under Directive No. 2001/83/EC\nof 6 November 2001, as amended by\nDirective 2003/63/EC of 25 June 2003, and EU Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004\nof 31 March 2004.\nThese rules\nprovide for the authorization of products, and regulate their manufacture,\nimportation, marketing and distribution.\nIt implements requirements which may be implemented without warning, as\nwell as a national pharmacovigilance\nsystem under which marketing authorizations may be withdrawn, and includes\npotential sanctions for breaches of\nthe rules, and on other bases such as harmfulness or lack of efficacy.\nEU Regulation No. 1223/2009 of 30 November 2009\non cosmetic products\nrequires that cosmetic products (which\nincludes dental products) be safe for human health when used under normal\nor reasonably foreseeable conditions of\nuse and comply with certain obligations which apply to manufacturer, importer and distributor.\nIt includes market\nsurveillance, and non-compliance may result in the recall or withdrawal of\nproducts, along with other sanctions.\nIn the EU, the EU Medical Device Regulation No. 2017/745 of 5 April 2017\n(“EU MDR”) covers a wide scope of\nour activities, from dental material to X-ray machines, and certain software.\nIt was meant to become applicable\nthree years after publication (i.e., May 26, 2020).\nHowever, on April 23, 2020, to allow European Economic Area\n(“EEA”) national authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers and other actors\nto focus fully on urgent priorities\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Council and Parliament\nadopted Regulation 2020/561,\npostponing the date of application of the EU MDR by one year (to\nMay 26, 2021).\nThe EU MDR significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory compliance\nrequirements for the medical device\nindustry as a whole.\nAmong other things, the EU MDR:\n•\nstrengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance\nonce they are available;\n•\nestablishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities\nfor the follow-up of the quality,\nperformance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n•\nimproves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the\nend-user or patient through\na unique identification number;\n•\nsets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and\nthe public with comprehensive\ninformation on products available in the EU;\n•\nstrengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such\nas implants, which may have to\nundergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market; and\n•\nidentifies importers and distributors and medical device products through\nregistration in a database\n(EUDAMED, which is not fully functional for the time being and might\nnot be so before the end of 2027 at\nthe earliest; therefore, the use of this database is only possible through\na voluntary basis and, by a way of\nconsequence, is currently not mandatory).\nIn particular, the EU MDR imposes strict requirements for the confirmation that a product meets\nthe regulatory\nrequirements, including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems, and for the\ndistribution, marketing and sale of medical devices, including post-market\nsurveillance.\n13\nRegulation 2023/607 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\namending Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and\n(EU) 2017/746 as regards the transitional provisions for certain medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical\ndevices\nhas, notably, extended the EU MDR transitional periods applicable to certain medical devices that have\nbeen assessed and/or certified under the Directive No. 93/42/EEC of\n1993\nconcerning medical devices\n(“EU\nMedical Device Directive”).\nSubject to certain conditions, medical devices that (i) obtained a certificate\nunder the\nEU Medical Device Directive from May 25, 2017, (ii) which was still valid\non May 26, 2021, and (iii) has not been\nsubsequently withdrawn may, for the moment, continue to be placed on the market or put into service until\nDecember 31, 2027 for higher risk devices or December 31, 2028 for\nmedium and lower risk devices. Nevertheless,\nEU MDR requirements regarding the distribution, marketing and sale\nincluding quality systems and post-market\nsurveillance have to be observed by manufacturers, importers and distributors\nas of the application date (i.e., since\nMay 26, 2021).\nOther EU regulations that may apply under appropriate circumstances\ninclude EU Regulation No. 1907/2006 of 18\nDecember 2006\nconcerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and\nRestriction of Chemicals\n, which\nrequires importers to register substances or mixtures that they import\nin the EU beyond certain quantities, and the\nEU Regulation No. 1272/2008 of 16 December 2008\non classification, labelling and packaging of substances and\nmixtures\n(currently under revision), which sets various obligations with respect\nto the labelling and packaging of\nconcerned substances and mixtures.\nFurthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future\nrequire us to delay product\nrelease, sale or distribution, or institute voluntary recalls of, or other corrective\naction with respect to products we\nsell, each of which could result in regulatory and enforcement actions, financial\nlosses and potential reputational\nharm.\nOur customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local\nand foreign governmental regulation, which\nmay affect our interactions with customers, including the design and functionality\nof our products.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state,\nlocal and foreign laws and regulations,\nincluding with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and\ndisposal of hazardous or potentially\nhazardous substances, and safe working conditions.\nIn addition, certain of our businesses must operate in\ncompliance with a variety of burdensome and complex billing and record-keeping\nrequirements in order to\nsubstantiate claims for payment under federal, state and commercial healthcare\nreimbursement programs.\nCertain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies\nand are subject to certain regulatory\nrequirements specific to government contractors.\nAntitrust and Consumer Protection\nThe federal government of the United States, most U.S. states and many\nforeign countries have antitrust laws that\nprohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive, as well as consumer\nprotection laws that seek to\nprotect consumers from improper business practices.\nAt the U.S. federal level, the Federal Trade Commission\noversees enforcement of these types of laws, and states have similar government\nagencies.\nViolations of antitrust\nor consumer protection laws may result in various sanctions, including criminal\nand civil penalties.\nPrivate\nplaintiffs may also bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust\nlaw violations, including\nclaims for treble damages.\nEU law also regulates competition and provides for detailed rules protecting\nconsumers.\nThe Biden Administration has indicated increased antitrust enforcement and\nhas been more aggressive in\nenforcement activities, including investigation and challenging non-compete\nrestrictions and other restrictive\ncontractual terms that it believes harm workers and competition.\nHealth Care Fraud\nCertain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar\nforeign) health care fraud and abuse, referral\nand reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.\nSome of these laws, referred to as “false\nclaims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent\nclaims for reimbursement to\nfederal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nOther laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit\nsoliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral\nof a patient or ordering,\npurchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending, ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services\nthat are\npaid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nCertain additional state and federal laws, such\n14\nas the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibit physicians and other\nhealth care professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which\nthe physician (or family member) has a\nfinancial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services\n(for example, durable medical\nequipment and medical supplies), unless an exception applies.\nViolations of Anti-Kickback Statutes or the Stark\nLaw may be enforced as violations of the federal False Claims Act.\nThe fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened\nenforcement activity over the past few\nyears, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who\nserve as whistleblowers by filing\ncomplaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states)\nunder applicable false claims laws,\nand who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.\nPenalties under fraud and abuse laws may be\nsevere, including treble damages and substantial civil penalties under\nthe federal False Claims Act, as well as\npotential loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state\nhealth care programs, criminal penalties,\nor imposition of a corporate integrity agreement or corporate compliance\nmonitor which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nAlso, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial,\nregulatory or\njudicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes\nin our operations or incur substantial defense\nand settlement expenses.\nEven unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private\nrelators could result in\nreputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.\nMost states have adopted similar state false claims laws,\nand these state laws have their own penalties, which may be in addition\nto federal False Claims Act penalties, as\nwell as other fraud and abuse laws.\nWith respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns\nabout\nfinancial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians,\ndentists and other healthcare\nprofessionals on the other.\nAs a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary\nto\nfacilitate compliance.\nWe\nalso are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations\nconcerning the conduct of our foreign\noperations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery\nAct, German anti-corruption laws\nand other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal\nbooks and records, which have been\nthe focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and\nabuse laws and regulations, and\nhave adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial\ncompliance, we cannot predict\nwhether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in\nresponse to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, or failure\nto comply with applicable law, could have\na material adverse effect on our business.\nAffordable Care Act and Other Insurance Reform\nThe ACA increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and\nincluded a number of provisions\ndesigned to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to\nprovide access to increased health coverage.\nThe ACA also materially expanded the number of individuals\nin the\nUnited States with health insurance.\nThe ACA has faced frequent legal challenges, including litigation seeking\nto invalidate and Congressional action\nseeking to repeal some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been\nimplemented.\nIn 2012, the United\nStates Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the\nACA and its individual mandate provision requiring\nthat people buy health insurance or else face a penalty, simultaneously limited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid\nexpansion, making such expansion a state-by-state decision.\nIn addition, one of the major political parties in the\nUnited States remains committed to seeking the ACA’s legislative repeal, but legislative efforts to do so have\npreviously failed to pass both chambers of Congress.\nUnder President Trump’s administration, a number of\nadministrative actions were taken to materially weaken the ACA, including,\nwithout limitation, by permitting the\nuse of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support”\nfor insurers providing policies\nunder the ACA.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions\nthat impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions,\nincome tax add-back provisions and\ndeductions, also effectively repealed the ACA’s\nindividual mandate by zeroing out the penalty for non-compliance.\nAn ACA lawsuit decided by the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found\nthe individual mandate to be\n15\nunconstitutional, and returned the case to the District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Texas for consideration of\nwhether the remainder of the ACA could survive the excision of the individual\nmandate.\nThe Fifth Circuit’s\ndecision was appealed to the United States Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court issued a decision on June 17, 2021.\nWithout reaching the merits of the case, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs in the case did not have standing\nto challenge the ACA.\nAny outcomes of future cases that change the ACA, in addition\nto future legislation,\nregulation, guidance and/or Executive Orders that do the same, could have a\nsignificant impact on the U.S.\nhealthcare industry.\nFor instance, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enhanced\npremium tax credits, which has\nresulted in an expansion of the number of people covered under the ACA.\nThese changes were time-limited, with\nsome enhancements in place for 2021 only and others available through\nthe end of 2022.\nAn ACA provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine\nAct or Open Payments Program (the\n“Sunshine Act”), imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements\nfor drug and device manufacturers and\ndistributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain\ncovered recipients (including\nphysicians, dentists, teaching hospitals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners,\nclinical nurse specialists, certified\nregistered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives), and for such\nmanufacturers and distributors and for\ngroup purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by covered\nrecipients in the\nreporting entity.\nCMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website,\nincluding amounts\ntransferred and physician, dentist, teaching hospital, and non-physician practitioner\nidentities.\nThe Sunshine Act\npre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may\nbe required to report under certain state\ntransparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Sunshine\nAct, and some of these state laws, as\nwell as the federal law, can be unclear.\nWe\nare also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of\ncertain\ninteractions between suppliers and their customers.\nIn the United States, government actions to seek to increase health-related\nprice transparency may also affect our\nbusiness.\nFor example, hospitals are currently required to publish online a list of\ntheir standard charges for all items\nand services, including discounted cash prices and payer-specific and de-identified negotiated\ncharges, in a publicly\naccessible online file.\nHospitals are also required to publish a consumer-friendly\nlist of standard charges for certain\n“shoppable” services (i.e., services that can be scheduled by a patient in\nadvance) and associated ancillary services\nor, alternatively, maintain an online price estimator tool.\nCMS may impose civil monetary penalties for\nnoncompliance with these price transparency requirements.\nAdditionally, the No Surprises Act (“NSA”), generally\neffective January 1, 2022, imposes additional price transparency requirements.\nThe NSA is intended to reduce the\nnumber of “out-of-network” patients.\nThis will result in fewer out-of-network payments to physicians and\nother\nproviders, which may cause financial stress to those providers who\nare dependent on higher out-of-network fees.\nAnother notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access\nand CHIP Reauthorization Act of\n2015 (“MACRA”), enacted on April 16, 2015, established a new payment framework,\nwhich modified certain\nMedicare payments to “eligible clinicians,” including physicians, dentists and\nother practitioners.\nUnder MACRA,\ncertain eligible clinicians are required to participate in Medicare through the Merit-Based\nIncentive Payment\nSystem (“MIPS”) or Advanced Alternative Payment Models, through which\nMedicare reimbursement to eligible\nclinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take\ninto account quality, promoting\ninteroperability, cost and improvement activities.\nData collected in the first MIPS performance year (2017)\ndetermined payment adjustments that began January 1, 2019.\nMACRA standards and payment levels continue to\nevolve, and reflect a fundamental change in physician reimbursement\nthat is expected to provide substantial\nfinancial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase\nphysician information technology\nand reporting obligations.\nThe implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain and will\ndepend on\nfuture regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace.\nNew state-level payment and delivery system\nreform programs, including those modeled after such federal programs, are\nalso increasingly being rolled out\nthrough Medicaid administrators, as well as through the private sector, which may further\nalter the marketplace and\nimpact our business.\nRecently, in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs, there has been increased scrutiny on\ndrug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the\nPresident, executive branch\nagencies and various states.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers\n(including relabelers and repackagers) to provide advance notice of certain\nprice increases and to report information\nrelating to those price increases, while others have taken legislative or administrative\naction to establish\nprescription drug affordability boards or multi-payer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of\nprescription drugs.\nAt\n16\nthe federal level, section 1927 of the Social Security Act sets forth Average Sales Price (ASP) reporting\nrequirements for manufacturers (including repackagers and relabelers) and\nrequires that manufacturers provide\nCMS with pricing information for their Part B-covered drugs no later\nthan 30 days after the close of the previous\nquarter.\nAlso at the federal level, several related bills have been introduced and\nregulations proposed which, if\nenacted or finalized, respectively, would impact drug pricing and related costs.\nAs a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution\nindustry in the United\nStates is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes.\nWe\ncannot predict what further reform\nproposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.\nEU Directive on the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products\nEU law provides for the regulation of the pricing of medicinal products which are\nimplemented by EU member\nstates (Directive No. 89/105/EC of 21 December 1988\nrelating to the transparency of measures regulating the\npricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance\nsystems\n).\nMember states may, subject notably to transparency conditions and to the statement of reasons based upon\nobjective and verifiable criteria, regulate the price charged (or its increases) for authorized\nmedicines and their level\nof reimbursement, or they may freeze prices, place controls on the profitability\nof persons responsible for placing\nmedicinal products on the market, and include or exclude the medicine on\nthe list of products covered by national\nhealth insurance systems.\nEU law does not expressly include provisions like those of the Sunshine Act in\nthe United States, but a growing\nnumber of EU member states (such as France in 2011 and Italy in 2022) have enacted laws to increase\nthe\ntransparency of relationships in the healthcare sector.\nThe scope of these laws varies from one member state to\nanother and may, for example, include the relations between healthcare industry players and physicians or their\nassociations, students preparing for medical professions or their associations,\nteachers, health establishments or\npublishers of prescription and dispensing assistance software.\nRegulated Software; Electronic Health Records\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of\ncomputer software and digital health\nproducts intended for use in health care settings.\nThe 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), signed into law on\nDecember 13, 2016, among other things, amended the medical device definition\nto exclude certain software from\nFDA regulation, including clinical decision support software that meets certain\ncriteria.\nOn September 27, 2019,\nthe FDA issued a guidance document describing the impact the Cures Act\non existing software policies.\nConcurrently, FDA issued a draft guidance describing FDA’s\napproach to clinical decision support software.\nOn\nSeptember 28, 2022, FDA issued final guidance that made several changes\nto the draft guidance and that provided a\nmore restrictive interpretation of exempt clinical decision support software.\nCertain of our businesses involve the\ndevelopment and sale of software and related products to support physician\nand dental practice management, and it\nis possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine\nthat one or more of our products is a\nmedical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to\nsubstantial additional requirements with\nrespect to these products.\nIn addition, our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management\nproducts, and our specialty home\nmedical supply business, include electronic information technology systems\nthat store and process personal health,\nclinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.\nThese information technology systems may be\nvulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious\nattack, which could require us to\nexpend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related\nsecurity concerns and could involve\nclaims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.\nFor example, we are directly or indirectly\nsubject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and\nregulations that protect the privacy and\nsecurity of personal information, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability\nand Accountability Act of 1996,\nas amended, and implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography\nand Marketing Act (“CAN-SPAM”), the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”), Section 5 of the\nFederal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), the California Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the California Privacy\nRights Act (“CPRA”) that became effective on January 1, 2023.\nSeveral other states have also passed\ncomprehensive privacy legislation, and several privacy bills have been proposed\nboth at the federal and state level\n17\nthat may result in additional legal requirements that impact our business.\nLaws and regulations relating to privacy\nand data protection are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations.\nThese requirements\nmay not be harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that\nis inconsistent from one jurisdiction to\nanother or may conflict with other rules or our practices.\nOur businesses’ failure to comply with these laws and\nregulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines,\npenalties and other liabilities and\nexpenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nAlso, evolving laws and regulations in this area could\nrestrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient\ninformation, or could require us to incur\nsignificant additional costs to re-design our products to reflect these legal requirements,\nwhich could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operations.\nAlso, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted the pan-European\nGeneral Data Protection\nRegulation (“GDPR”), effective from May 25, 2018, which increased privacy\nrights for individuals (“Data\nSubjects”), including individuals who are our customers, suppliers and\nemployees.\nThe GDPR extended the scope\nof responsibilities for data controllers and data processors, and generally\nimposes increased requirements and\npotential penalties on companies, such as us, that are either established\nin the EU and process personal data of Data\nSubjects (regardless the Data Subject location), or that are not established\nin the EU but that offer goods or services\nto Data Subjects in the EU or monitor their behavior in the EU. Noncompliance\ncan result in penalties of up to the\ngreater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues (sanction\nthat may be public), and Data Subjects\nmay seek damages.\nMember states may individually impose additional requirements\nand penalties regarding\ncertain limited matters (for which the GDPR let some room of flexibility),\nsuch as employee personal data.\nWith\nrespect to the personal data it protects, the GDPR requires, among other things,\ncontroller accountability, consents\nfrom Data Subjects or another acceptable legal basis to process the\npersonal data, notification within 72 hours of a\npersonal data breach where required, data integrity and security, and fairness and transparency regarding the\nstorage, use or other processing of the personal data.\nThe GDPR also provides rights to Data Subjects relating\nnotably to information, access, rectification, erasure of the personal\ndata and the right to object to the processing.\nOn August 20, 2021, China promulgated the PRC Personal Information\nProtection Law (“PIPL”), which took effect\non November 1, 2021.\nThe PIPL imposes specific rules for processing personal information\nand it also specifies\nthat the law shall also apply to personal information activities carried\nout outside China but for the purpose of\nproviding products or services to PRC citizens.\nAny non-compliance with these laws and regulations may\nsubject\nus to fines, orders to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed\nillegal by regulatory authorities, other\npenalties, as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings against us,\nwhich may affect our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nThe PIPL carries maximum penalties of CNY50 million or 5%\nof the annual\nrevenue of entities that process personal data.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy\nprotections afforded California residents, became effective January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA generally requires\ncompanies, such as us, to institute additional protections regarding\nthe collection, use and disclosure of certain\npersonal information of California residents.\nCompliance with the obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in\npart on how particular regulators interpret and apply them.\nRegulations were released in August of 2020, but there\nremains some uncertainty about how the CCPA will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the regulators.\nIf\nwe fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the CCPA, we may be\nsubject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation, any of which may\nnegatively impact our reputation, require\nus to expend significant resources, and harm our business.\nFurthermore, California voters approved the CPRA on\nNovember 3, 2020, which amends and expands the CCPA, including by providing consumers with additional rights\nwith respect to their personal information, and creating a new state agency, the California Privacy Protection\nAgency, to enforce the CCPA\nand the CPRA.\nThe CPRA came into effect on January 1, 2023, applying to\ninformation collected by businesses on or after January 1, 2022.\nAs noted above, other states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly\nconsidered the adoption of\nsimilarly expansive personal privacy laws, backed by significant\ncivil penalties for non-compliance.\nWhile we\nbelieve we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply\nwith the GDPR, CCPA, PIPL,\nCPRA and other state law requirements, our compliance with data privacy and\ncybersecurity laws is likely to\nimpose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the\ninterpretations of the requirements, or changes in\nour practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the\nrequirements, could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\n18\nWe\nalso sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians\nand dentists, use to store and\nmanage patient medical or dental records.\nThese customers, and we, are subject to laws, regulations and industry\nstandards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of\nthe privacy and security of those records, and our products may also be\nused as part of these customers’\ncomprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with\napplicable privacy\nand security laws.\nPerceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services,\nor the perceived or actual\nfailure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply\nwith applicable legal or contractual data\nprivacy and security requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational\nharm, but may also lead to claims\nagainst us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial\nfines, penalties and other\nliabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.\nVarious\nfederal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care\nproviders of certain EHR systems and\nprocesses.\nThe initiatives include, among others, programs that incentivize\nphysicians and dentists, through MIPS,\nto use EHR technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements,\nincluding regarding quality, promoting\ninteroperability, cost and improvement activities.\nQualification for the MIPS incentive payments requires the use\nof EHRs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated\nin evolving standards adopted by CMS and the\nOffice of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology of HHS (“ONC”).\nCertain of our businesses\ninvolve the manufacture and sale of such certified EHR systems and other products\nlinked to government supported\nincentive programs.\nIn order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we\nmust satisfy these changing\ngovernmental standards.\nIf any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards,\nyet have been relied upon by\nhealth care providers to receive federal incentive payments, we may be exposed\nto risk, such as under federal health\ncare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act.\nAdditionally, effective September 1, 2023, the Office of\nthe Inspector General (“OIG”) for HHS issued a final rule implementing\ncivil money penalties for information\nblocking as established by the Cures Act.\nOIG incorporated regulations published by ONC as the basis for\nenforcing information blocking penalties.\nEach information blocking violation carries up to a $1 million penalty.\nMoreover, in order to satisfy our customers, and comply with evolving legal requirements, our products\nmay need\nto incorporate increasingly complex functionality, such as with respect to reporting and information blocking.\nAlthough we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve\nincreased costs, and our failure to\nimplement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards,\ncould have a material adverse effect on\nour business.\nOther health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic\nhealth data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic\ntransactions, such as transactions\ninvolving claims submissions to third party payers.\nFailure to abide by these and other electronic health data\ntransmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims,\nsubstantial fines, penalties, and other liabilities\nand expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nAdditionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the\nability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged\ninformation becomes\nincreasingly important.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with\nan electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.\nThere may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting\nhealth care.\nE-Commerce\nElectronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health\ncare supply and distribution\nrelationships.\nOur distribution business is characterized by rapid technological\ndevelopments and intense\ncompetition.\nThe continuing advancement of online commerce requires\nus to cost-effectively adapt to changing\ntechnologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a\nvariety of new services to address the\nchanging demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly\nin response to competitive\nofferings.\nThrough our proprietary, technologically-based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive\nalternatives.\nWe\nbelieve that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition\nand large customer base built\non solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in\nthis significant aspect of the distribution business.\n19\nWe\ncontinue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our online\npresence and capabilities, including our\nonline commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.\nInternational Transactions\nUnited States and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to\nabide by certain standards relating to\nthe importation and exportation of products.\nWe\nalso are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the\nconduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct, the U.K. Bribery Act, German\nanti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining\nto the accuracy of our internal books and\nrecords, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those\nimposed in the United States.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws\nand regulations promulgated\nthereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct\nof our business, there can be no\nassurance that laws and regulations that impact our business or laws and\nregulations as they apply to our customers’\npractices will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSee “\n” for a discussion of additional burdens, risks and regulatory developments\nthat may\naffect our results of operations and financial condition.\nProprietary Rights\nWe hold trademarks relating to the “Henry Schein\n®\n” name and logo, as well as certain other trademarks.\nWe intend\nto protect our trademarks to the fullest extent practicable.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nHenry Schein has a long, rich history of a purpose-driven model that engages\nour five key stakeholders – our\nsupplier partners, customers, our employees, who are referred to as Team Schein Members (“TSMs”), stockholders\nand society at large – of our Mosaic of Success to drive sustained, long-term economic\nsuccess while also creating\nshared value for society.\nThrough our strong values-based culture, our sustainability\napproach and environmental,\nsocial, and governance (“ESG”) efforts integrates our sense of purpose into the way we operate our\nbusiness so that\nwe can “do well by doing good” for a healthier planet and healthier people.\nOverseen by the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee of our Board of Directors (“Board”) with the Compensation\nCommittee also playing a role\nin ESG matters related to human capital engagement and executive\ncompensation, some key 2023 highlights related\nto human capital matters include:\n•\ncontinuing to evaluate our pay equity analysis for the majority of\nthe U.S. workforce, which reviews\ncompensation across gender and ethnic groups for equity and fairness;\n•\nexpanding our Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”) learning journey by educating TSMs\non key D&I\ntopics; and\n•\ncontinuing to drive a culture of wellness and engagement for our TSMs by\nfostering an environment\nwhere they can feel engaged, included and psychologically safe.\nAt Henry Schein, our employees are our greatest asset.\nWe employ more than 25,000 people, approximately 55%\nof our workforce is based in the United States and approximately 45%\nis based outside of the United States.\nApproximately 14% of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nWe believe that our\nrelations with our employees are excellent.\nOur TSMs are the cornerstone of the Company.\nWe provide a connected and caring community that invests in the\ncareer journey of our TSMs and encourages their contribution to\nour mission of making the world healthier.\nOur\nTSM experience strategy is centered around our Team Schein Values,\nor the guiding principles and shared\nresponsibilities of Henry Schein and its TSMs.\nWe know our business success is built on the engagement and\ncommitment of our team, which is dedicated to meeting the needs of their\nfellow TSMs, our customers, supplier\npartners, stockholders and society.\n20\nWe recognize the changes in how and where we work, and the expectations of our team members to still feel\nconnected to our values-based culture.\nThroughout 2023, we rolled out a continuous listening program\nthat used\nvarious vehicles, including The Pulse Global Culture Survey and TSM\nroundtables, to garner feedback from our\nTSMs on their employee experience.\nThe Pulse Global Culture Survey was redesigned in 2023 to measure\nscores\naligned to our Team Schein Values\n- and we received good or excellent scores in all values.\nThe feedback showed\nus that TSMs overall enjoy working for the Company and intend\nto stay, mainly driven by our values-based culture\nand providing TSMs with a sense of purpose, a meaningful experience\nand an overall positive work environment.\nHowever, there are also areas of opportunity, which include a focus on reducing burnout and stress, and providing\nmore opportunities for career mobility.\nThis feedback is shared with our Executive Management Committee\nand\nBoard, both of whom are committed to addressing the identified opportunities.\nAs part of this commitment, some\nhighlights in 2023 included:\n•\nCommunity\n: Provide opportunities for TSMs to have fun while contributing to an inclusive team\nthat respects\nand supports one another.\n•\nContinued focus on creating a diverse and inclusive environment where TSMs\nfeel a sense of\nbelonging.\nIn 2023, Diversity and Inclusion, for the second time, was our\ntop strength identified in The\nPulse Global Culture Survey.\nTo guide our efforts and education related to D&I, our Diversity and\nInclusion Council, with engagement from our Board and Executive\nManagement Committee, drives the\nCompany’s overall D&I strategy.\nTo deepen our commitment to D&I across the Company, Global\nDirectors and Vice Presidents each have a goal tied to their compensation to champion D&I and attend\neducational training, and in 2023 we cascaded this goal down\nto our U.S. Managers.\nWe continue to\nexpand our D&I learning journey, educating TSMs on key D&I topics.\nWe understand the importance\nof ensuring our internal team reflects the diversity of our customers and society\nand continue to focus\non this through our talent planning, compensation and recruitment processes\nin alignment with our\ncorporate strategic planning objectives to achieve concrete results.\nWe continue to publish our United\nStates Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) EEO-1\ndata for the U.S.\n•\nLaunched Henry Schein Games, a virtual platform with a field-day type event\nat various locations that\nbrought TSMs together through friendly competition by earning\npoints for their team by engaging in\ncultural-related activities and posting photos.\n•\nLaunched Community Circles, which brought TSMs across the Company\ntogether to connect about\ntopics, hobbies and activities that they are passionate about.\n•\nHosted Connection Days throughout the globe at Henry Schein facilities, which\nwere designed to boost\nteam morale by bringing TSMs together to participate in fun non-work-related\nactivities at least once\nper quarter.\n•\nContinued to expand our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), an\ninclusive and diverse vehicle for all\nTSMs to share, connect, learn and develop both personally and professionally.\nEach of our ERGs has a\nsponsor from our Executive Management Committee and our Board.\nOur CEO engages directly in\nmany of our ERG programs.\n•\nLaunched an enhanced Onboarding Program that provides TSMs with\nstrategic programming to help\nensure a successful start to their careers at Henry Schein.\nTo help ensure TSMs who are joining the\nCompany in a remote or hybrid working environment feel connected to\nour values-based culture, we\nlaunched a Culture Ambassador Program, which provides new hires with\na mentor for 90 days to walk\nthrough how we live our values and how they can engage.\n•\nCaring:\nBuild a world we want to live in by supporting each other and\nthe communities in which we live and\nwork.\n•\nContinued to offer a variety of opportunities to volunteer for team-building and engaging\nin local\ncommunities in which TSMs live and work, such as through Carry the Load,\nthe We Care Global\nChallenge, Back to School and Holiday Cheer.\n•\nLaunched a new quarterly campaign to provide opportunities for TSMs\nto engage in meaningful\nways that connect back to their own personal purpose, such as helping\nthe community through\ncorporate social responsibility activities virtually or in-person.\n•\nEnhanced our strategic partnerships with industry associations, customers\nand suppliers that\nsupport access to quality health care through various key programs and\ninitiatives (e.g., Gives Kids\nA Smile, Alpha Omega-Henry Schein Cares Holocaust Survivors Oral\nHealth Program and Release\n21\nthe Pressure).\n•\nExpanded our Steps for Suicide Prevention campaign, which brings TSMs\ntogether to walk for a\ncause and provide education.\n•\nWe also understand the importance of driving a culture of wellness for our own team members\nthrough our Mental Wellness Committee, which is supported by our CEO, Executive Management\nCommittee and Board.\nIn 2023, we rolled out a ‘Year of Wellness’\ncampaign that provided\nmonthly tips, videos and educational programming to TSMs that focused\non how they may be\nfeeling that month.\nWe also launched an education program for managers of TSMs that provided\ntactical examples of how to help reduce burnout amongst teams and support\nthe new way of\nworking.\n•\nCareer:\nProvide opportunities for TSMs to develop personally and professionally with an emphasis on\nembodying our values to achieve our collective goals with excellence\nand integrity.\n•\nContinued investment in our employees by providing both formal and\ninformal learning\nopportunities focused on growing and enhancing knowledge, skills and abilities\nthrough a\nbroad suite of professional development training programs for current and\nfuture roles.\nIn\n2023, we saw an increase in participation in our workshops, with TSMs\nreporting a high\nutilization of skills learned.\n•\nContinued expansion of our formal mentorship and coaching programs.\n•\nContinued roll-out of talent planning efforts designed to ensure a strong, diverse leadership\npipeline across the organization by strategically identifying and developing talent\nthrough\ntargeted development opportunities and intentional succession plans.\nInformation derived from\ntalent planning efforts informs curriculum design and content to help focus on the\nright\ncapabilities and help ensure alignment of career development efforts with the future\nneeds of\nthe organization.\nOur Board is provided with periodic updates regarding our talent\nand\nsuccession planning efforts and participates in professional development activities\nwith our\nTSMs.\n•\nEnhanced company-wide recognitions, including our Teddy Philson Team Schein Award,\nwhich was redesigned in 2023 to provide more visibility and\nmeaningful recognition to TSMs\nwho exemplify our Team Schein Values,\nas well as other programs including service awards\nwhich highlight TSMs who exemplify our Team Schein Values.\nAvailable Information\nWe make available free of charge through our Internet website, www.henryschein.com, our annual report on Form\n10-K,

    "text": "Our business operations could be affected by factors that are not presently known\nto us or that we currently\nconsider not to be material to our operations, so you should not consider\nthe risks disclosed in this section to\nnecessarily represent a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company believes that the following\nrisks could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial\nresults, financial condition and/or\nthe trading price of our common stock.\nThe order in which these factors appear does not necessarily reflect\ntheir\nrelative importance or priority.\nCOMPANY RISKS\nWe are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of a significant volume of our products.\nWe obtain a significant volume of the products we distribute from third parties, with whom we generally do not\nhave long-term contracts.\nWhile there is typically more than one source of supply, some key suppliers, in the\naggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell.\nIn 2023, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers\nand our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 25% and 4%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases.\nBecause of our dependence upon such suppliers, our operations are\nsubject to the suppliers’ ability and willingness\nto supply products in the quantities that we require, and the risks include delays\ncaused by interruption in\nproduction based on conditions outside of our control, including\na supplier’s failure to comply with applicable\ngovernment requirements (which may result in product recalls and/or\ncessation of sales) or an interruption in the\nsuppliers’ manufacturing capabilities.\nIn the event of any such interruption in supply, we would need to identify\nand obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis.\nThere is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain\nsuch alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all, and an extended\ninterruption in supply, particularly of\na high-sales volume product, could result in a significant disruption in our\nsales and operations, as well as damage\nto our relationships with customers and our reputation.\nIn addition, certain of our suppliers have had their ability to\nservice certain markets restricted or negatively impacted because\nof allegations of forced labor in their supply\nchain.\nForced labor legislation affecting the supply chain has increased around\nthe world, and the United States\nrecently passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.\nOur supply chain could be materially disrupted if our\nsuppliers fail to comply with, or are unable to satisfy our demand\nfor products, as a result of applicable forced labor\nlegislation and regulations.\nOur\nfuture\ngrowth\n(especially\nfor\nour\ntechnology\nand\nvalue-added\nservices\nsegment)\nis\ndependent\nupon\nour\nability\nto\ndevelop\nor\nacquire\nand\nmaintain\nand\nprotect\nnew\nproducts\nand\ntechnologies\nthat\nachieve\nmarket\nacceptance with acceptable margins.\nOur future success depends on our ability to timely develop (or obtain the right\nto sell) competitive and innovative\n(particularly for our technology and value-added services segment)\nproducts and services and to market them\nquickly and cost-effectively.\nOur ability to anticipate customer needs and emerging trends and develop or acquire\nnew products, services and technologies at competitive prices requires significant\nresources, including employees\nwith the requisite skills, experience and expertise, particularly in our\ntechnology segment, including dental practice\nmanagement, patient engagement and demand creation software solutions.\nThe failure to successfully address these\nchallenges could materially disrupt our sales and operations.\nAdditionally, our software and e-services products,\nlike software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are\nreleased.\nAny such defective software may result in increased expenses\nrelated to the software and could adversely\naffect our relationships with customers as well as our reputation.\nWith respect to certain software and e-services\nthat we develop, we rely primarily upon copyright, trademark and\ntrade secret laws, as well as contractual and\ncommon law protections and confidentiality obligations.\nWe cannot provide assurance that such legal protections\nwill be available, adequate or enforceable in a timely manner to protect\nour software or e-services products.\nRisks inherent in acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures could\noffset the anticipated benefits.\nOne of our business strategies has been to expand our domestic and\ninternational markets in part through\nacquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions\nand enter into joint ventures in the\nfuture.\nSuch transactions require significant management attention,\nmay place significant demands on our\noperations, information systems, legal, regulatory, compliance, financial, and human resources functions, and\nthere\n26\nis risk that one or more may not succeed.\nWe cannot be sure, for example, that we will achieve the benefits of\nrevenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or joint ventures\nor that we will avoid unforeseen additional\ncosts, taxes, or expenses.\nOur ability to successfully implement our acquisition and joint venture\nstrategy depends\nupon, among other things, the following:\n•\nthe availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at\nacceptable prices;\n•\nour ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially\nbe prohibited due to U.S. or\nforeign antitrust regulations;\n•\nthe liquidity of our investments and the availability of financing on\nacceptable terms;\n•\nour ability to retain customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or\njoint ventures;\n•\nour ability to retain, recruit and incentivize the management of the\ncompanies we acquire; and\n•\nour ability to successfully integrate these companies’ operations, services,\nproducts and personnel with\nour culture, management policies, legal, regulatory, and compliance policies, cybersecurity systems and\npolicies, internal procedures, working capital management, financial,\nand operational controls and\nstrategies.\nFurthermore, some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may give\nrise to an obligation to make contingent\npayments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments\ncould have material adverse impacts on our\nfinancial results individually or in the aggregate.\nAdditionally, when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or\nexecuting alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay\nthe accomplishment\nof our strategic objectives.\nAlternatively, we may dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less\nthan we had anticipated.\nDispositions may also involve continued financial involvement\nin a divested business,\nsuch as through transition service agreements, indemnities or other current\nor contingent financial obligations.\nUnder these arrangements, performance by the acquired or divested\nbusiness, or other conditions outside our\ncontrol, could affect our future financial results.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to\nwhich we are a party may discourage\nthird parties from seeking to acquire us that might otherwise result in\nour stockholders receiving a premium\nover the market price of their shares.\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may\nmake it more difficult for a third-party to\nacquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may impact the price\nthat certain investors might be willing to pay\nin the future for shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions, among other things require (i) the affirmative vote\nof the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote\nto approve a merger, consolidation, or\na sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets;\nand (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders\nof at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to (a)\nremove a director; and (b) to amend or repeal our\nby-laws, with certain limited exceptions.\nIn addition, certain of our employee incentive plans provide\nfor\naccelerated vesting of stock options and other awards upon termination without\ncause within two years following a\nchange in control, or grant the plan committee discretion to accelerate\nawards upon a change of control.\nFurther,\ncertain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance\npayments and certain\nbenefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate\nfor good reason, in each\ncase within two years following a change in control or within ninety days prior\nto the effective date of the change in\ncontrol or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change\nin control.\nAdverse changes in supplier rebates or other purchasing incentives\ncould negatively affect our business.\nThe terms\non which\nwe purchase\nor sell\nproducts from\nmany suppliers\nmay entitle\nus to\nreceive a\nrebate or\nother\npurchasing incentive based on the attainment of certain growth\ngoals.\nSuppliers may reduce or eliminate rebates or\nincentives\noffered\nunder\ntheir\nprograms,\nor\nincrease\nthe\ngrowth\ngoals\nor\nother\nconditions\nwe\nmust\nmeet\nto\nearn\nrebates\nor\nincentives\nto\nlevels\nthat\nwe\ncannot\nachieve.\nIncreased\ncompetition\neither\nfrom\ngeneric\nor\nequivalent\nbranded products\ncould result\nin us\nfailing to\nearn rebates\nor incentives\nthat are\nconditioned upon\nachievement of\ngrowth goals.\nAdditionally, factors outside\nof our control, such as customer\npreferences, consolidation of suppliers\nor supply issues, can have a material impact on\nour ability to achieve the growth goals established by\nour suppliers,\n27\nwhich\nmay\nreduce the\namount of\nrebates\nor\nincentives we\nreceive.\nThe\noccurrence\nof\nany\nof\nthese events\ncould\nhave an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\nSales of corporate brand products entail additional risks, including the risk that such sales could\nadversely affect\nour relationships with suppliers.\nWe offer\ncertain corporate brand products that are available exclusively from us.\nThe sale of such products subjects\nus to the risks generally encountered by entities that source, market and sell corporate brand products, including but\nnot\nlimited to\npotential product\nliability risks,\nmandatory or\nvoluntary product\nrecalls, potential\nsupply chain\nand\ndistribution\nchain\ndisruptions,\nand\npotential\nintellectual\nproperty\ninfringement\nrisks.\nAny\nfailure\nto\nadequately\naddress\nsome\nor\nall\nof\nthese\nrisks\ncould\nhave\nan\nadverse\neffect\non\nour\nbusiness, financial\ncondition\nor\noperating\nresults.\nIn\naddition,\nan\nincrease\nin\nthe\nsales\nof\nour\ncorporate\nbrand\nproducts\nmay\nnegatively\naffect\nour\nsales\nof\nproducts owned by our\nsuppliers which, consequently,\ncould adversely impact certain\nof our supplier relationships.\nOur ability to locate qualified, economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements, and to\nacquire sufficient\nproducts in\na timely\nand effective\nmanner,\nis critical\nto ensuring,\namong other\nthings, that\ncustomer confidence\nis\nnot diminished.\nIn addition, we\nare exposed to\nthe risk\nthat our competitors\nor our large\ncustomers may introduce\ntheir own\nprivate label,\ngeneric, or\nlow-cost products\nthat compete\nwith our\nproducts at\nlower price\npoints.\nSuch\nproducts could\ncapture significant\nmarket share\nor decrease\nmarket prices\noverall, eroding\nour sales\nand margins.\nAny failure\nto develop sourcing\nrelationships with a\nbroad and deep\nsupplier base could\nhave an adverse\neffect on\nour business, financial condition or operating results.\nINDUSTRY RISKS\nSecurity risks generally associated with our information systems and our\ntechnology products and services have\nin the recent past adversely affected our business and results of operations, and could\nin the future materially\nadversely affect our business and our results of operations if such products, services,\nor systems (or third-party\nsystems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject\nto cyberattacks or fail for any\nextended period of time.\nWe rely on information systems (“IS”) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store\ncustomer, product, supplier and employee data to, among other things:\n•\nmaintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and\ndistribution of thousands of\ninventory items from numerous distribution centers;\n•\nreceive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n•\nmanage the accurate billing and collections for our customers;\n•\nprocess payments to suppliers;\n•\nprovide products and services that maintain certain of our customers’ electronic\nmedical or dental\nrecords (including protected health information of their patients); and\n•\nmaintain and manage global human resources, compensation and payroll\nsystems.\nIn addition to health information in our customers’ electronic\nmedical and dental records, certain of our IS stores\nother sensitive personal and financial information, such as healthcare\nand other information related to our\nemployees, as well as other sensitive information such as credit card\ninformation from our third-party business\npartners, that is confidential,\nand in many cases subject to privacy laws.\nOur IS are vulnerable to, among other things, natural disasters,\npower losses, computer viruses, telecommunication\nfailures, cybersecurity threats and other criminal activity. Information security risks have significantly increased\nin\nrecent years in part because of an overall increase in cyber incidents,\ntheir increased sophistication, and the\ninvolvement of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and foreign state agents. The healthcare\nindustry in particular\nhas been targeted by threat actors seeking to undermine companies’ cybersecurity\ndefensive measures.\nWe have processes in place intended to ensure that our security measures keep pace with new and emerging risks.\nWe regularly review,\nmonitor and implement multiple layers of security through technology, processes and our\npeople.\nWe utilize security technologies designed to protect and maintain the integrity of our IS and data, and our\n28\ndefenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external\nparties.\nDespite these efforts, our facilities\nand systems and those of our third-party service providers have been,\nand may in the future be, vulnerable to\nprivacy and security incidents, cybersecurity attacks and data breaches,\nacts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses\nand other malicious code, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human\nerrors,\nattacks or other acts\nundermining IS of third party business partners including our customers,\nor other similar events that could impact\nthe security, reliability and availability of our systems.\nIn addition, hardware, software or applications developed\ninternally or procured from third parties may contain defects\nin design or manufacture or other problems that could\nunexpectedly compromise information security.\nAs a practical matter, so long as we depend on IS to operate our\nbusiness, and our business partners do the same, there can be no guaranty\nthat such measures will successfully stop\nany one particular cybersecurity incident given the constantly evolving\nnature of the threat.\nWe may also incur\nsubstantial costs as we update our cybersecurity defense systems and our general\ncomputer controls to meet\nevolving challenges, and legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity\nmay increase our costs to develop\nor implement new technology products and services.\nA cyberattack that bypasses or compromises our IS cybersecurity / or general\ninformation technology (“IT”)\ncontrols (including third-party systems we rely on) causing an IS security breach\nmay lead, and has in the past led,\nto a disruption of our IS business systems (including third-party systems we\nrely on), interruption of operations\n(including, without limitation, receiving, verifying, and processing customer orders,\ncustomer service, accounts\npayable, warehouse management and shipping, and systems tied to internal\ncontrols over financial reporting), the\nloss or alteration of business, financial, and other protected information,\na negative impact on our financial\nperformance, and to an adverse impact on our financial accounting\nand reporting controls.\nA cyberattack that bypasses or compromises our IS cybersecurity / or general\ncomputer controls or those of third\nparties with whom we engage may also lead to claims against us by\naffected parties and/or governmental agencies,\nand involve fines and penalties, as well as substantial defense and settlement\nexpenses.\nAny of these impacts may\nalone, or collectively, have a material impact on our business.\nA successful cyberattack has, and may again in the\nfuture, disrupt our business operations, adversely impact our financial\naccounting and reporting of results of\noperations, divert the attention of management, and adversely impact\nour results of operations.\nIn addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers\nthat are technology-based, and a\ncyberattack that bypasses the IS supporting our products or services causing\na security breach and/or perceived\nsecurity vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant\nloss of business and reputational\nharm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against\nus by our customers and/or governmental\nagencies.\nIn addition, certain of our practice management products and services\npurchased by health care\nproviders, such as physicians and dentists, are used to store and manage patient\nmedical or dental records.\nThese\ncustomers are subject to laws and regulations which require that they\nprotect the privacy and security of those\nrecords, and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive\ndata security programs, including\nin connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.\nIn addition to immaterial and unrelated prior incidents at certain of\nour subsidiaries, in October 2023, Henry Schein\nexperienced a cybersecurity incident that primarily affected the operations of our\nNorth American and European\ndental and medical distribution businesses.\nHenry Schein One, our practice management software, revenue\ncycle\nmanagement and patient relationship management solutions business was\nnot affected, and our manufacturing\nbusinesses were mostly unaffected.\nOnce we became aware of the issue, we took steps to assess, contain\nand\nremediate this incident.\nWe restored affected systems and applications, our distribution operations resumed and we\nreactivated our ecommerce platform.\nWe also notified law enforcement and our employees, customers, suppliers\nand investors, informing them of both the incident and management’s efforts to mitigate its impact on our daily\noperations and data maintained on the Company’s systems.\nSubsequently, on or about November 8, 2023, we\ndetermined that the threat actor obtained personal and sensitive information\nmaintained on our systems belonging to\ncertain third parties and since that date we have notified affected parties and potentially\naffected parties as\nappropriate.\nThe scope of personal and sensitive data impacted is still under investigation.\nOn November 22, 2023,\nwe experienced a related disruption to our ecommerce platform and\nrelated applications, which has since been\nremediated.\nThe October 2023 cybersecurity incident disrupted key\nbusiness operations, adversely impacted our\nfinancial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, diverted\nattention of management, and caused the\nCompany to incur significant remediation costs.\nWe continue to review the effects of the incident on the\nCompany’s business as we do expect some short-term residual impact on our financial results in 2024.\nIn January\n29\n2024, two putative class actions were filed against us based on the incident\nand one of these actions is still pending.\nWe are spending, and plan to expend in the future, additional resources to continue to protect against, or to address\nproblems caused by, business interruptions, and data security breaches.\nIn addition, customers and suppliers may impose additional cybersecurity\nrequirements on us as a result of the\nincident we experienced in October 2023, and some customers and suppliers\nhave made such requests to date.\nWe\ncannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy such additional requirements,\nand failure to satisfy such\nrequirements could result in a loss of revenue or diminished product\navailability that could materially affect our\nbusiness adversely.\nWe also may be perceived as a more vulnerable target of the cyber hackers as a result of the\nOctober 2023 incident.\nIf the Company is subject to more attacks in the future as a result of\nthe recent incident, this\ncould materially affect our business adversely.\nWe maintain cyber insurance, subject to certain retentions and policy limitations.\nWith respect to the October 2023\ncybersecurity incident, we have a $60 million insurance policy, following a $5 million retention.\nThe health care products distribution industry is highly competitive\n(including, without limitation, competition\nfrom third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating, and we may not\nbe able to compete successfully.\nWe compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.\nSome of our\ncompetitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which\ncould allow them to compete more\nsuccessfully.\nMost of our products are available from several sources and our customers\ntend to have relationships\nwith several distributors.\nCompetitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular\nproducts, which we would\nthen be unable to market.\nManufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and\nthereby\neliminate or reduce our role in distribution.\nIndustry consolidation among health care product distributors and\nmanufacturers, price competition, product unavailability, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or\nto interruptions in manufacturing supply, or the emergence of new competitors, also could increase competition.\nConsolidation has also increased among manufacturers of health care\nproducts, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our margins and product availability.\nWe could be subject to charges and financial losses in the\nevent we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments contained\nin some of our contracts.\nAdditionally,\ntraditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged\nby electronic online commerce\nsolutions.\nThe continued advancement of online commerce by third\nparties will require us to cost-effectively adapt\nto changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business\n(including with additional\nvalue-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and\nour customers on a timely basis.\nThe\nemergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and\neffectively respond to changes on a\ntimely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe health care industry is experiencing changes due to political, economic\nand regulatory influences that could\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\nThe health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing\npolitical, economic, and regulatory influences.\nIn recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing,\nsignificant changes\ndriven by various efforts to reduce costs, including, among other factors: trends\ntoward managed care; collective\npurchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners;\nand changes in\nreimbursements to customers, including increased attention to value-based payment\narrangements, as well as\ngrowing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental\nofficials.\nBoth our profitability\nand the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws\nand regulations reducing\nreimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and devices,\nand/or medical treatments or services, or\nchanges to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined.\nIf we are unable to react effectively to\nthese and other changes in the health care industry, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe ACA\ngreatly expanded health insurance coverage in the United States and has been\nthe target of litigation and\nCongressional reform efforts since its adoption.\nAny outcome of future court cases that change the ACA, in\naddition to future legislation, regulation, guidance and/or Executive Orders\nthat do the same, could have a\nsignificant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry and the ability or willingness\nof individuals to engage with it.\n30\nExpansion of GPOs, DSOs or provider networks and the multi-tiered\ncosting structure may place us at a\ncompetitive disadvantage.\nThe health care products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which\ncan vary by manufacturer\nand/or product.\nUnder this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable\nprices for health care products\nthan we are able to obtain.\nThe multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health\ncare providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs and DSOs, demand more favorable\npricing terms.\nAdditionally, the formation of provider networks, GPOs and DSOs may shift purchasing decisions\nto entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship\nand may threaten our ability to compete\neffectively, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results.\nIn addition, such organizations may\nestablish direct relationships with manufacturers, thereby either eliminating\nor reducing the services historically\nprovided by distributors.\nAlthough we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers\nto access lower\nprices demanded by GPO and DSO contracts or other contracts,\nand to develop relationships with existing and\nemerging provider networks, GPOs and DSOs, we cannot guarantee that such terms will\nbe obtained or contracts\nexecuted.\nIncreases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers\ncould harm our business.\nOur ability to meet our customers’ expedited delivery expectations is an\nintegral component of our business\nstrategy for which our customers rely.\nShipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business.\nWe ship\nalmost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear\nthe cost of shipment.\nAccordingly,\nany significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition\nor operating results.\nWhile we have recently experienced increases in the cost of shipping,\nwe do not expect these\nadditional expenses to be material to our results.\nHowever, it is possible that such costs could be material in the\nfuture.\nSimilarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers, including at transportation centers or\nshipping ports, could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially\nadversely affect our ability to deliver\nproducts on a timely basis.\nMACRO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS\nUncertain global and domestic macro-economic and political conditions\ncould materially adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nUncertain global and domestic macro-economic and political conditions\nthat affect the economy and the economic\noutlook of the United States, Europe, Asia, and other parts of the\nworld could materially adversely affect our results\nof operations and financial condition.\nThese uncertainties, include, among other things:\n•\nelection results;\n•\nchanges to laws and policies governing foreign trade, tariffs and sanctions, or greater\nrestrictions on\nimports and exports;\n•\nsupply chain disruptions;\n•\nchanges in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy;\n•\nchanges to the relationship between the United States and China;\n•\nsovereign debt levels;\n•\nthe inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived\neconomic, currency or\nbudgetary crises or issues;\n•\nconsumer confidence;\n•\nunemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured\nand underinsured population);\n•\nchanges in regulatory and tax regulations;\n•\ninterest rate fluctuations, and strengthening of the dollar, which have and will continue to\nimpact our\nresults of operations;\n•\navailability of capital;\n•\nincreases in fuel and energy costs;\n•\nthe effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase\nprices over time and\npass through to our customers price increases we may receive;\n31\n•\nchanges in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions;\n•\nincreases in labor costs or health care costs;\n•\nthe threat or outbreak of war, terrorism or public unrest (including, without limitation, the war in\nUkraine, the Israel-Gaza war and other unrest and threats in the Middle East,\nand the possibility of a\nwider European or global conflict); and\n•\nchanges in laws and policies governing manufacturing, development, and\ninvestment in territories and\ncountries where we do business.\nAdditionally, changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government\nspending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending,\nand/or higher income or corporate\ntaxes, which could depress spending overall.\nRecessionary or inflationary conditions and depressed levels of\nconsumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to\nreduce, modify, delay,\nor cancel plans to purchase\nour products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change\ntheir terms of sale.\nWe have experienced\ninflationary pressures, including higher freight costs and interest expense.\nAlthough inflation impacts both our\nrevenues and costs, the depth and breadth of our product portfolio often\nallows us to offer lower-cost national brand\nsolutions or corporate brand alternatives to our more price-sensitive\ncustomers who are unable to absorb price\nincreases, thus positioning us to protect our gross profit.\nThe strengthening of the dollar, likewise, has impacted\nour revenues and costs, but neither inflation nor exchange rates have\nmaterially impacted our results of operations\nin fiscal year 2023.\nWe generally sell products to customers with payment terms.\nIf customers’ cash flow or\noperating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to\nmake scheduled payments or obtain credit,\nthey may not be able to, or may delay, payment to us.\nLikewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or\nimpose different payment terms.\nREGULATORY\nAND LITIGATION RISKS\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements\ncould materially adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nWe strive to be compliant with the applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below in all material\nrespects, and believe we have effective compliance programs and other controls\nin place to ensure substantial\ncompliance.\nHowever, compliance is not guaranteed either now or in the future as certain laws, regulations\nand\nguidance may be subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could\naffect our ability to comply, as well as,\nfuture changes, additions and enforcement approaches, including in light\nof political changes.\nWhen we discover\nsituations of non-compliance we seek to remedy them and bring\nthe affected area back into compliance.\nChanges\nwith respect to the applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below\nmay require us to update or revise\nour operations, services, marketing practices, and compliance programs\nand controls, and may impose additional\nand unforeseen costs on us, pose new or previously immaterial risks to us, or\nmay otherwise have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nThere can be no assurance that current and future government\nregulations will not\nadversely affect our business, and we cannot predict new regulatory priorities, the\nform, content or timing of\nregulatory actions, and their impact on the health care industry and on our\nbusiness and operations.\nGlobal efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on\nproduct pricing.\nIn the United\nStates, in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs, there has been\nincreased scrutiny on drug\npricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the President,\nexecutive branch agencies\nand various states.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be required to report drug pricing data under federal laws and\nregulations.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted laws, that may\napply to some of our operations, that\nrequire drug manufacturers, including re-packagers or re-labelers, to provide\nadvance notice of certain price\nincreases and to report information relating to those price increases, while\nothers have taken legislative or\nadministrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or\nmulti-payer purchasing pools to reduce\nthe cost of prescription drugs.\nAt the federal level, several related bills have been introduced\nand regulations\nproposed which, if enacted or finalized, respectively, would impact drug pricing and related costs.\nUnder the Sunshine Act, we are required to collect and report detailed\ninformation regarding certain financial\nrelationships we have with covered recipients, including physicians, dentists,\nteaching hospitals, and certain other\nnon-physician practitioners.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be required to report information under certain state\n32\ntransparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Sunshine\nAct, and some of these state laws, as\nwell as the federal law, can be unclear.\nWe are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain\ninteractions between suppliers and their customers.\nWhile we believe we have substantially compliant programs\nand controls in place satisfying the above laws and requirements,\nsuch compliance imposes additional costs on us\nand the requirements are sometimes unclear.\nIn the United States, government actions to seek to increase health-\nrelated price transparency may also affect our business.\nOur business is subject to additional requirements under various local, state,\nfederal and international laws and\nregulations applicable to the sale and distribution of, and third-party payment\nfor, pharmaceuticals and medical\ndevices and HCT/P products.\nAmong the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances\nAct, the FDC Act, the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act, including DSCSA,\nSection 361 of the Public Health\nServices Act and Section 401 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act\nof the Social Security Act.\nAmong other\nthings, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:\n•\nregulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, marketing and promotion,\nsampling, pricing and\nreimbursement, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, returning or\nrecalling, reporting, and\ndistribution of, and record keeping for drugs, HCT/P products and\nmedical devices,\nincluding\nrequirements with respect to unique medical device identifiers;\n•\nsubject us to inspection by the FDA and DEA and similar state authorities;\n•\nregulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products\nthat are considered\nhazardous materials;\n•\nrequire us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance\nwith applicable FDA\nrequirements;\n•\nrequire us to report average sales price (ASP) for drugs or biologicals payable\nunder Medicare Part B to\nCMS with or without a Medicaid drug rebate agreement;\n•\nrequire registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;\n•\nrequire record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug\nproducts;\n•\nrequire us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious\norders of controlled\nsubstances to the DEA and certain states;\n•\nrequire us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject\nus to inspection of our\nrecall procedures and activities;\n•\nimpose on us reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or\nmedical device causes\nserious illness, injury or death;\n•\nrequire manufacturers, wholesalers, re-packagers and dispensers of prescription\ndrugs to identify and\ntrace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed;\n•\nrequire the licensing of prescription drug wholesalers and third-party\nlogistics providers; and\n•\nmandate compliance with standards for the recordkeeping, storage\nand handling of prescription drugs,\nand associated reporting requirements.\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of\ncomputer software and digital health\nproducts intended for use in health care settings.\nThe Cures Act, signed into law on December 13, 2016, among\nother things, amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software\nfrom FDA regulation, including\ncertain clinical decision support software.\nOn September 27, 2019, the FDA issued a suite of guidance documents\non digital health products, which incorporated applicable Cures Act standards,\nand on September 28, 2022, the\nFDA subsequently finalized certain of these guidance documents, including\nregarding the types of clinical decision\nsupport tools and other software that are exempt from regulation by the FDA as\nmedical devices, and the FDA\ncontinues to issue new guidance in this area.\nCertain of our businesses involve the development and\nsale of\nsoftware and related products to support physician and dental practice management,\nand it is possible that the FDA\nor foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products\nis subject to regulation as a\nmedical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to\nsubstantial additional requirements,\ncosts and potential enforcement actions or liabilities for noncompliance with\nrespect to these products. Some of our\nimaging software is regulated as a medical device which subjects our businesses\nto substantial additional\nrequirements, costs and potential enforcement actions or liabilities for noncompliance\nwith respect to these\nproducts.\n33\nApplicable federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations also may require\nus to meet various standards\nrelating to, among other things, licensure or registration, program eligibility, procurement, third-party\nreimbursement, sales and marketing practices, product integrity, and supply tracking to product manufacturers,\nproduct labeling, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal\ninformation, installation, maintenance\nand repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products.\nThe FDA and DEA, as well as CMS\n(including with respect to complex Medicare reimbursement requirements\napplicable to our specialty home medical\nsupplies business) and state Medicaid agencies, have recently increased\ntheir regulatory and enforcement activities\nand, in particular, the DEA has heightened enforcement activities due to the opioid crisis in the United States.\nOur\nbusiness is also subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental\nlaws and regulations affecting\nour operations abroad.\nThe failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations, or new interpretations\nof existing laws and regulations,\nor the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\nThe costs\nto us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes\nand regulations, as they now exist and as they\nmay be modified, could be material.\nAllegations by a governmental body that we have not complied\nwith these\nlaws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant\nwith applicable laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate\ncompliance programs and controls in place to\nensure substantial compliance, if it is determined that we have not complied\nwith these laws, we are potentially\nsubject to warning letters, substantial civil and criminal penalties,\nmandatory recall of product, seizure of product\nand injunction, consent decrees and suspension or limitation of payments\nto us, product sale and distribution.\nIf we\nenter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we\ncould be required to make settlement\npayments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including\nfines and the loss of licenses.\nNon-compliance\nwith government requirements could also adversely affect our ability to participate\nin important federal and state\ngovernment health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid,\nand damage our reputation.\nThe EU Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) may adversely affect our business.\nThe EU MDR, applicable since May 26, 2021, significantly modifies and intensifies\nthe regulatory compliance\nrequirements for the medical device industry as a whole.\nAmong other things, the EU MDR:\n•\nstrengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance\nonce they are\navailable;\n•\nestablishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities\nfor the follow-up of the quality,\nperformance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n•\nimproves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user\nor patient\nthrough a unique identification number;\n•\nsets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and\nthe public with\ncomprehensive information on products available in the EU;\n•\nstrengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such\nas implants, which may have to\nundergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market; and\n•\nidentifies importers and distributors and medical device products through\nregistration in a database\n(EUDAMED not due, for the time being, until the end of 2027 at\nthe earliest, as mentioned above).\nIn particular, the EU MDR imposes strict requirements for the confirmation that a product\nmeets the regulatory\nrequirements, including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems, and for the\ndistribution, marketing and sale of medical devices, including post-market surveillance.\nAs mentioned above,\npursuant to Regulation 2023/607 and subject to certain conditions, medical devices\nthat (i) obtained a certificate\nunder the EU Medical Device Directive from May 25, 2017, (ii) which was\nstill valid on May 26, 2021, and (iii)\nhas not been subsequently withdrawn may, for the moment, continue to be placed on the market or put into service\nuntil December 31, 2027 for higher risk devices or December 31, 2028 for medium\nand lower risk devices.\nNevertheless, EU MDR requirements regarding the distribution,\nmarketing and sale including quality systems and\npost-market surveillance have to be observed by manufacturers, importers\nand distributors as of the application date\n(i.e., May 26, 2021).\nThe modifications created by the EU MDR may have an impact\non the way we design and\nmanufacture products and the way we conduct our business in\nthe EEA.\n34\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care\nfraud or other laws and regulations, we\ncould suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations,\nwhich could materially\nadversely affect our business.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar\nforeign) health care fraud and abuse, referral\nand reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.\nSome of these laws, referred to as “false\nclaims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent\nclaims for reimbursement to\nfederal, state, and other health care payers and programs.\nOther laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit\nsoliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce or reward\nthe referral of a patient or\nordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of,\nitems or\nservices that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nCertain additional state and\nfederal laws, such as the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibit\nphysicians and other health care professionals from referring a patient\nto an entity with which the physician (or\nfamily member) has a financial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated\nhealth services (for example,\ndurable medical equipment and medical supplies), unless an exception applies.\nViolations of Anti-Kickback\nstatutes or the Stark Law may be enforced as violations of the federal False Claims\nAct.\nThe fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened\nenforcement activity over the past few\nyears, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who\nserve as whistleblowers by filing\ncomplaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states)\nunder applicable false claims laws,\nand who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.\nPenalties under fraud and abuse laws may be\nsevere, including treble damages and substantial civil penalties under\nthe federal False Claims Act, as well as\npotential loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state\nhealth care programs, criminal penalties,\nor imposition of a corporate compliance monitor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlso,\nthese measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or\njudicial authority in a manner that\ncould require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense\nand settlement expenses.\nEven\nunsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result\nin reputational harm and the\nincurring of substantial costs.\nMost states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state\nlaws have\ntheir own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims\nAct penalties, as well as other fraud and abuse\nlaws.\nWith respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns\nabout\nfinancial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians,\ndentists, and other health care providers,\non the other.\nAs a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices\nas necessary to facilitate\ncompliance.\nOur aspirations, goals and disclosures related to environmental, social\nand governance matters and the focus on\nregulators and private litigants among other things on related claims made\nby companies and funds expose us to\nnumerous risks, including reputational, financial, legal and other risks,\nthat could have an adverse impact on us,\nincluding on our stock price.\nCalifornia has adopted stringent new climate disclosure requirements,\nas has the EU,\nand the SEC appears about to adopt expansive new disclosure requirements\non climate change.\nIn the EU, the Directive No. 2019/1937 of October 23, 2019,\non the protection of persons who report breaches of\nUnion law,\norganizes the legal protection of whistleblowers.\nThis Directive covers whistleblowers reporting\nbreaches of certain EU laws, in particular as regards public health, the above-mentioned\nDirective No. 2001/83,\nRegulation No. 726/2004 or, as regards data protection, the GDPR.\nThe Directive protects a wide range of people\nand includes former employees.\nAll private companies with 50 or more employees are required\nto create effective\ninternal reporting channels.\nAll EU Member States other than Poland and Estonia have now implemented\nthe\nDirective.\nWe also are subject to the requirements of the new Directive No. 2022/2464 on corporate sustainability reporting\n(“CSR Directive”) adopted on December 14, 2022 and which has to be\nimplemented by EU members states by July\n6, 2024, at the latest.\nBy amending Directives No. 2004/109, No. 2006/43, No. 2013/34\nand Regulation No.\n537/2014, the CSR Directive strengthens the existing rules on non-financial\nreporting by setting new requirements\nfor large companies to publish sustainability-related information and, in particular, disclose details about\ntheir risks\nand impacts on environmental matters.\n35\nWe\nalso are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations\nconcerning the conduct of our foreign\noperations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery\nAct, German anti-corruption laws\nand other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal\nbooks and records, which have been\nthe focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.\nOur businesses are generally subject to\nnumerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial\nresults, including, without limitation,\nsecurities, antitrust, consumer protection, and marketing laws and regulations.\nIn the EU, both active and passive bribery are criminalized.\nThe EU Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA\nof 22 July 2003\non combating corruption in the private sector\nestablishes more detailed rules on the liability of\nlegal persons and deterrent sanctions.\nHowever, the liability of legal persons is regulated at a national level.\nFailure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and other\nlaws and regulations, could result in\nsignificant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of\nlicenses and the ability to participate in\nfederal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nWe may\ndetermine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees\nor enter into other arrangements to\nresolve such matters.\nIntentional or unintentional failure to comply with settlement agreements\nor consent decrees\ncould materially adversely affect our business.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and\nabuse and other laws and\nregulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls\nin place to ensure substantial\ncompliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our\nservices or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or\ninterpretation of laws, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the collection,\nstorage and processing of sensitive\npersonal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions,\nwe could be required to make\nsignificant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties, or\nother liabilities.\nOur businesses that involve physician and dental practice management\nproducts, and our specialty home medical\nsupply businesses, include electronic information technology systems\nthat store and process personal health,\nclinical, financial, and other sensitive information of individuals.\nThese information technology systems may be\nvulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and\nmalicious attack, which could require us to\nexpend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address\nrelated security concerns, and could involve\nclaims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.\nWe are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations\nthat protect the privacy and security of personal information, such as HIPAA, CAN-SPAM, TCPA,\nSection 5 of the\nFTC Act, the CCPA, and the CPRA that became effective on January 1, 2023.\nLaws and regulations relating to\nprivacy and data protection are continually evolving and subject to\npotentially differing interpretations.\nThese\nrequirements may not be harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in\na manner that is inconsistent from one\njurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices.\nOur businesses’ failure to comply with\nthese laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial\nfines, penalties and other\nliabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nAlso, evolving laws and regulations in\nthis area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient\ninformation, or could\nrequire us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products\nto reflect these legal requirements, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted\nthe GDPR effective from May 25, 2018,\nwhich increased privacy rights for Data Subjects, including individuals\nwho are our customers, suppliers and\nemployees.\nThe GDPR extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers\nand data processors, and\ngenerally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies,\nsuch as us, that are either\nestablished in the EU and process personal data of Data Subjects (regardless\nthe Data Subject location), or that are\nnot established in the EU but that offer goods or services to Data Subjects in the EU\nor monitor their behavior in the\nEU. Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20\nmillion, or 4% of global company\nrevenues (sanction that may be public), and Data Subjects may seek damages.\nMember states may individually\nimpose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain limited\nmatters (for which the GDPR left some\n36\nroom of flexibility), such as employee personal data.\nWith respect to the personal data it protects, the GDPR\nrequires, among other things, controller accountability, consents from Data Subjects or another acceptable legal\nbasis to process the personal data, notification within 72 hours\nof a personal data breach where required, data\nintegrity and security, and fairness and transparency regarding the storage, use or other processing of the personal\ndata.\nThe GDPR also provides rights to Data Subjects relating notably\nto information, access, rectification, erasure\nof the personal data and the right to object to the processing.\nOn August 20, 2021, China promulgated the PIPL, which took effect on November\n1, 2021.\nThe PIPL imposes\nspecific rules for processing personal information and it also specifies\nthat the law shall also apply to personal\ninformation activities carried out outside China but for the purpose\nof providing products or services to PRC\ncitizens.\nAny non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject\nus to fines, orders to rectify or terminate\nany actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities, other penalties,\nas well as reputational damage or legal\nproceedings against us, which may affect our business, financial condition or results\nof operations.\nThe PIPL\ncarries maximum penalties of CNY50 million or 5% of the annual revenue\nof entities that process personal data.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents, became\neffective January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA generally requires companies, such as us, to institute additional protections\nregarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal information\nof California residents.\nCompliance\nwith the obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them.\nRegulations were released in August of 2020, but there remains some\nuncertainty about how the CCPA will be\ninterpreted by the courts and enforced by the regulators.\nIf we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert\nthat we have failed to comply with the CCPA, we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation,\nany of which may negatively impact our reputation, require us to expend\nsignificant resources, and harm our\nbusiness.\nFurthermore, California voters approved the CPRA on November 3,\n2020, which will amend and expand\nthe CCPA, including by providing consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information, and\ncreating a new state agency to enforce CCPA and CPRA.\nThe CPRA came into effect on January 1, 2023, applying\nto information collected by businesses on or after January 1, 2022.\nOther states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly\nconsidered the adoption of similarly expansive\npersonal privacy laws, backed by significant civil penalties for non-compliance.\nWhile we believe we have\nsubstantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with\nthe GDPR, CCPA, PIPL and CPRA\nrequirements, our compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity laws\nis likely to impose additional costs on us,\nand we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or\nchanges in our practices in response to\nnew requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nWe also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and\nmanage patient medical or dental records.\nThese customers and we are subject to laws, regulations and\nindustry\nstandards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of\nthe privacy and security of those records.\nOur products or services may be used as part of these customers’\ncomprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their\nefforts to comply with applicable data\nprivacy and security laws and contractual requirements.\nPerceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products\nor services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who\nuse our products or services to comply\nwith applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements,\nmay not only cause us significant\nreputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers\nand/or governmental agencies and\ninvolve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses\nand costs for remediation.\nAdditionally, under\nthe GDPR, health data belong to the category of “sensitive data” and benefit\nfrom specific protection.\nProcessing\nof such data is generally prohibited, except for specific exceptions.\nCertain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of electronic\nhealth record (EHR) systems and other\nproducts linked to government supported incentive programs, where\nthe EHR systems must be certified as having\ncertain capabilities designated in evolving standards, such as those adopted\nby CMS and ONC.\nIn order to maintain\ncertification of our EHR products, we must satisfy the changing governmental\nstandards.\nIf any other EHR systems\ndo not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers\nto receive federal incentive\npayments, we may be exposed to risk, such as under federal health care\nfraud and abuse laws, including the False\nClaims Act.\nAdditionally, effective September 1, 2023, the OIG for HHS issued a final rule implementing civil\nmoney penalties for information blocking as established by the Cures Act.\nOIG incorporated regulations published\n37\nby ONC as the basis for enforcing information blocking penalties.\nEach information blocking violation carries a $1\nmillion penalty.\nWhile we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications\nand with applicable\nfraud and abuse laws and regulations and that we have adequate compliance\nprograms and controls in place to\nensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in\napplicable law, or interpretation of laws, or\nresulting changes in our compliance programs and controls, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, in order to satisfy our customers and comply with evolving legal requirements, our products\nmay need to\nincorporate increasingly complex functionality, such as with respect to reporting and information blocking.\nAlthough we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve\nincreased costs, and our failure to\nimplement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards,\ncould have a material adverse effect on\nour business.\nAdditionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the\nability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged\ninformation becomes\nincreasingly important.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with\nan electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state, and local governments, as well as\nforeign jurisdictions.\nFrom time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed\nthat could materially\nadversely affect our tax positions.\nThere can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be\nmaterially\nadversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives.\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely\ncomplex and subject to varying interpretations.\nAlthough we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and\nconsistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent,\nthere can be no assurance that our tax positions\nwill not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be\nsuccessful in any such challenge.\nWe face inherent risk of exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the\nevent that the use of the products we sell results in injury.\nOur business involves a risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary\ncourse of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant\nin cases as a result of our distribution of\nproducts.\nAdditionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental and medical products.\nAs a\nresult, we could be subject to the potential risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement or other\nclaims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by\nthose entities.\nIn addition, as our corporate brand\nbusiness continues to grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather\nthan the ultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims.\nAnother potential risk we face in the\ndistribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products\ninfiltrating the supply chain.\nIn\naddition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous\nmaterials.\nThe improper\nhandling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation\nof such materials could subject us to liability or\nat least legal action that could harm our reputation.\nCustoms policies or legislative import restrictions could hinder the Company’s ability to import goods necessary\nto our operations on a timely basis and result in government enforcement\nactions and/or sanctions.\nGovernment-imposed import policies and legislation regulating the\nimport of goods and prohibiting the use of\nforced labor or human trafficking could result in delays or the inability to import\ngoods in a timely manner that are\nnecessary to our operations, and such policies or legislation could also\nresult in financial penalties, other sanctions,\ngovernment enforcement actions and reputational harm.\nWhile the Company has policies against and seeks to\navoid the import of goods that are manufactured in whole or in part by forced\nlabor or through human trafficking,\nas a result of legislative and governmental policy initiatives, we may be\nsubject to increasing potential delays,\nadded costs, supply chain disruption and other restrictions.\nGENERAL RISKS\nOur business operations, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition\nand liquidity may be negatively\n38\nimpacted by the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or similar wide-spread\npublic health\nconcerns and other natural or man-made disasters, such as terrorism, civil\nunrest, fire, and extreme weather\n.\nOur business operations, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition\nand liquidity may be negatively\nimpacted by the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, similar wide-spread\npublic health concerns and\nother natural or man-made disasters, such as terrorism, civil unrest, fire,\nand extreme weather (“disasters”).\nFor\nexample, as a global healthcare solutions company, the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental responses\nto it\nhad, and may again have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand cash flows and may\nresult in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nThe impacts and potential impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic included, and could include as a result of other disasters,\nthe following, among other\nimpacts:\n•\nsignificant volatility in supply, demand and selling prices for personal protective equipment (PPE), test\nkits and related products;\n•\nreduction in peoples’ ability and willingness to be in public;\n•\nreduction in peoples’ ability and willingness to seek elective care;\n•\ninterrupted operations of industries that use or manufacture the products\nwe distribute;\n•\nimpact of adapted business practices;\n•\nsignificant changes in political conditions;\n•\nvolatility in the financial market; and\n•\nunavailability or impairment of our manufacturing, distribution, or other\nfacilities, or firmwide systems\nsuch as our information systems.\nThe impact from disasters may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein,\nany of which could have a material\nadverse effect on us.\nOur global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially\nadversely affect our business.\nOur global operations are subject to risks that could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe risks that our\nglobal operations are subject to include, among other things:\n•\ndifficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;\n•\ndifficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products, establishing channels of distribution\nand contract\nmanufacturing in foreign markets;\n•\nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;\n•\nuncertainties relating to trade agreements and international trade relationships;\n•\nlonger payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables\nin foreign\njurisdictions;\n•\nrepatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;\n•\nregulatory requirements, including, without limitation, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining\nto the accuracy of our internal books and records;\n•\nlitigation risks, new or unanticipated litigation developments and\nthe status of litigation matters;\n•\nunexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products and import/export\ntariffs, quotas,\nsanctions or penalties;\n•\nlimitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual\nproperty;\n•\nunexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;\n•\nchanges in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment;\n•\ncivil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political\nor military coups; and\n•\nrisks associated with climate change, including physical risks such as\nimpacts from extreme weather\nevents and other potential physical consequences, regulatory and technological\nrequirements, market\ndevelopments, stakeholder expectations and reputational risk.\n39\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon our senior\nmanagement, and our revenues and profitability\ndepend on our relationships with capable sales representatives,\nservice technicians, and other personnel who\ninteract directly with our customers, as well as customers, suppliers\nand manufacturers of the products that we\ndistribute.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of\nmembers of our existing senior\nmanagement, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nIn November 2022, Mr.\nBergman’s employment agreement was extended through December 31, 2025.\nAlthough the Company has an\ninternal succession plan for its senior leadership team, including Mr. Bergman, the loss of the services of Mr.\nBergman could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not currently have “key man” life insurance\npolicies on any of our employees.\nCompetition for senior management is intense, burnout and turn-over rates\nare\nincreasing workplace concerns, and we may not be successful in\nattracting and retaining key personnel.\nAdditionally, our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with\nqualified sales representatives, service technicians, and other personnel\nwho interact directly with our customers, as\nwell as customers, suppliers, and manufacturers.\nIf we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons\nor fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future,\nour business may be materially adversely\naffected.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely\naffect the availability and cost of credit to us.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with\nrespect to indebtedness will depend on\nour operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing\neconomic conditions and financial,\nbusiness and other factors beyond our control.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect\nthe availability and cost of credit to us."

sensitive information\nmaintained on our systems belonging to\ncertain third parties and since that date we have notified affected and potentially affected parties\nas appropriate.\nThe scope of personal and sensitive data impacted is still under investigation.\nOn November 22, 2023, we\nexperienced a related disruption to our ecommerce platform and related\napplications, which has since been\nremediated.\nAs described in “Management’s Discussion & Analysis – 2023 Compared to 2022, the incident\nadversely impacted our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023.\nWe also expect some short-term\nresidual impact on our financial results in 2024.\nWe maintain cybersecurity insurance, subject to certain retentions and policy limitations.\nWith respect to the\nOctober 2023 cybersecurity incident, we have a $60 million insurance policy, following a $5 million retention.\n46\nExecutive-Level Overview\nHenry Schein, Inc. is a solutions company for health care professionals powered\nby a network of people and\ntechnology.\nWe\nbelieve we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-\nbased dental and medical practitioners, as well as alternate sites of care.\nWe\nserve more than one million customers\nworldwide including dental practitioners, laboratories, physician practices, and\nambulatory surgery centers, as well\nas government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.\nWe\nbelieve that we have a strong\nbrand identity due to our more than 91 years of experience distributing health\ncare products.\nWe are headquartered in Melville, New York,\nemploy approximately 25,000 people (of which approximately\n11,500 are based outside of the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 33 countries and territories.\nOur\nbroad global footprint has evolved over time through our organic success as well as\nthrough contribution from\nstrategic acquisitions.\nWe\nhave established strategically located distribution centers around\nthe world to enable us to better serve our\ncustomers and increase our operating efficiency.\nThis infrastructure, together with broad product and service\nofferings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables\nus to be a single source of\nsupply for our customers’ needs.\nWhile our primary go-to-market strategy is in our capacity as a distributor, we also market and sell our own\ncorporate brand portfolio of cost-effective, high-quality consumable merchandise products,\nincluding in vitro\ndiagnostic devices, manufacture certain dental specialty products in\nthe areas of implants, orthodontics and\nendodontics, manufacture drug products, and repackage/relabel prescription drugs\nand/or devices.\nWe\nhave\nachieved scale in these global businesses primarily through acquisitions, as\nmanufacturers of these products\ntypically do not utilize a distribution channel to serve customers.\nWe\nconduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health\ncare distribution and (ii) technology and\nvalue-added services.\nThese segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.\nOur global\ndental businesses serve office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools, government\nand other\ninstitutions.\nOur medical businesses serve physician offices, urgent care centers, ambulatory care sites,\nemergency\nmedical technicians, dialysis centers, home health, federal and state governments\nand large enterprises, such as\ngroup practices and integrated delivery networks, among other providers\nacross a wide range of specialties.\nThe health care distribution reportable segment, combining our global dental and\nmedical operating segments,\ndistributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment\nrepair services,\nbranded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, dental specialty\nproducts (including implant,\northodontic and endodontic products), diagnostic tests, infection-control products,\nPPE products and vitamins.\nOur global technology and value-added services business provides software, technology\nand other value-added\nservices to health care practitioners.\nOur technology business offerings include practice management software\nsystems for dental and medical practitioners.\nOur value-added practice solutions include practice consultancy,\neducation, revenue cycle management and financial services on a non-recourse\nbasis, e-services, practice\ntechnology, network and hardware services, as well as consulting, and continuing education services for\npractitioners.\nA key element to grow closer to our customers is our One Schein initiative, which\nis a unified go-to-market\napproach that enables practitioners to work synergistically with our supply chain,\nequipment sales and service and\nother value-added services, allowing our customers to leverage the\ncombined value that we offer through a single\nprogram.\nSpecifically, One Schein provides customers with streamlined access to our comprehensive offering of\nnational brand products, our corporate brand products and proprietary specialty\nproducts and solutions (including\nimplant, orthodontic and endodontic products).\nIn addition, customers have access to a wide range of services,\nincluding software and other value-added services.\n47\nIndustry Overview\nIn recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.\nThis trend has benefited\ndistributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low\nprices.\nIt also has accelerated the\ngrowth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying\ngroups, which, in addition to\ntheir emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors\ncapable of providing\nspecialized management information support.\nWe\nbelieve that the trend towards cost containment has the potential\nto favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can\nenhance the efficiency and\nfacilitation of practice management.\nOur operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies\nand transactions that we\nundertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the\nhealth care industry, including consolidation of health care distribution companies, health care reform, trends\ntoward managed care, cuts in Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.\nIndustry Consolidation\nThe health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented\nand diverse.\nThe industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of\nrelatively small offices to group practices\nor service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have\ncombined or otherwise associated their practices.\nDue in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage\nlarge quantities of supplies\nin their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health\ncare practitioners\nhas been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid,\nreliable and substantially complete\norder fulfillment.\nThe purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically\nmade by the\npractitioner or an administrative assistant.\nSupplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more\nthan\none distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.\nThe trend of consolidation extends to our customer base.\nHealth care practitioners are increasingly seeking to\npartner, affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals, health systems, group practices or physician\nhospital organizations.\nIn many cases, purchasing decisions for consolidated groups\nare made at a centralized or\nprofessional staff level; however, orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices.\nWe\nbelieve that consolidation within the industry will continue to\nresult in a number of distributors, particularly\nthose with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to\ncombine with larger companies that can\nprovide growth opportunities.\nThis consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking\nto acquire\ncompanies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide\nopportunities to serve a broader\ncustomer base.\nOur approach to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as\na provider of products and services\nto the health care industry.\nThis trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement\nour existing\noperations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired\nbusinesses.\nAs industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to\ncapitalize on this trend, as we believe we\nhave the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure, although\nthere can be no assurances\nthat we will be able to successfully accomplish this.\nWe\nalso have invested in expanding our sales/marketing\ninfrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision\nmakers who do not reside in the office-\nbased practitioner setting.\nAs the health care industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible\ncandidates for joint venture or\nacquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our\nrole as a provider of products and services to\nthe health care industry.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue\nany such\nopportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued.\nIf additional transactions are entered into or\nconsummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there\ncan be no assurance that the\nintegration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.\n48\nAging Population and Other Market Influences\nThe health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth\ndue to the aging population,\nincreased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology\nand testing, new pharmacological\ntreatments, and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment\non\ninsurance coverage.\nIn addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the\nshift of procedures and\ndiagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly\nphysicians’ offices.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database, between 2023\nand 2033, the 45 and older\npopulation is expected to grow by approximately 11%.\nBetween 2023 and 2043, this age group is expected to grow\nby approximately 21%.\nThis compares with expected total U.S. population growth\nrates of approximately 6%\nbetween 2023 and 2033\nand approximately 11% between 2023 and 2043.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database, in 2023\nthere are approximately seven million\nAmericans aged 85 years or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care\nand elder-care\nservices.\nBy the year 2050, that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately\n19 million.\nThe population\naged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase by approximately 23% during\nthe same period.\nAs a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for health\ncare services continue to increase in the\nUnited States.\nWe believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by\ncurrent and future operating, economic, and industry conditions.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,\nor CMS, published “National Health Expenditure Data” indicating\nthat total national health care spending reached\napproximately $4.5 trillion in 2022, or 17.3% of the nation’s gross domestic product, the benchmark\nmeasure for\nannual production of goods and services in the United States.\nHealth care spending is projected to reach\napproximately $7.2 trillion by 2031, or 19.6% of the nation’s projected gross domestic product.\nGovernment\nOur businesses are generally subject to numerous laws and regulations that could\nimpact our financial performance,\nand failure to comply with such laws or regulations could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nSee “\n” for a discussion of

priorities of the BOLD+1 strategic\nplan, streamlining operations and other initiatives to increase efficiency.\nWe revised our previous expectations of\ncompletion and we have extended this initiative through the end of 2024.\nWe are currently unable in good faith to\nmake a determination of an estimate of the amount or range of amounts\nexpected to be incurred in connection with\nthese activities, both with respect to each major type of cost associated\ntherewith and to the total cost, or an\nestimate of the amount or range of amounts that will result in future\ncash expenditures.\nDuring the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December\n25, 2021, we recorded\nrestructuring costs of $80 million, $128 million, and $8 million, respectively.\nThe restructuring costs for these\nperiods primarily related to severance and employee-related costs,\nimpairment of intangible assets, accelerated\namortization of right-of-use lease assets and fixed assets, other lease exit\ncosts, and certain business exit costs\ndiscussed below.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, in connection with our restructuring\nplan, we recorded an impairment of\nan intangible asset of $12 million related to a planned disposal of a non-U.S.\nbusiness.\nThe disposal is expected to\nbe completed in 2024.\nThis impairment is included in the $80 million of restructuring\ncharges discussed above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, in connection with our\nrestructuring plan, we vacated one of the\nbuildings at our corporate headquarters in Melville, New York, which resulted in an accelerated amortization of a\nright-of-use lease asset of $34 million.\nWe also initiated the disposal of a non-profitable U.S. business and\nrecorded related costs of $49 million, which primarily consisted of\nimpairment of intangible assets and goodwill,\ninventory impairment, and severance and employee-related costs.\nThese expenses are included in the $128 million\nof restructuring charges discussed above.\nThe disposal was completed during the first quarter of 2023.\nOn August 26, 2022, we acquired Midway Dental Supply.\nIn connection with this acquisition, during the year\nended December 31, 2022, we recorded integration costs of $3 million\nrelated to one-time employee and other\ncosts, as well as restructuring charges of $9 million, which are included in the\n$128 million of restructuring charges\ndiscussed above.\nOn November 20, 2019, we committed to a contemplated restructuring\ninitiative intended to mitigate stranded costs\nassociated with the spin-off of our animal health business and to rationalize operations\nand provide expense\nefficiencies.\nThese activities were originally expected to be completed by\nthe end of 2020 but we extended them to\nthe end of 2021 in light of the changes to the business environment brought\non by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe\nrestructuring activities under this prior initiative were completed\nin 2021.\n51\n2023 Compared to 2022\nNote: Percentages for Net Sales; Gross Profit; Operating Expenses; Other\nExpense, Net; and Income Taxes are\nbased on actual values and

which are distributed primarily to health care providers,\npractice consultancy, education, revenue cycle management and financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, continuing\neducation services for practitioners, consulting and other services.\nGlobal Sales\nWe report our results of operations on a 52 or 53 weeks per fiscal year basis ending on the last Saturday of\nDecember.\nThe year ended December 30, 2023, consisted of 52 weeks,\nand the year ended, December 31, 2022\nconsisted of 53 weeks,\nresulting in an extra week of sales.\nGlobal net sales for the year ended December 30, 2023 decreased 2.4%.\nThe components of our sales growth are\npresented in the table above.\nThe 4.4% decrease in our internally generated local currency sales was primarily\nattributable to a decrease in sales\nof PPE products and COVID-19 test kits.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the estimated\nincrease in\ninternally generated local currency sales, excluding PPE products\nand COVID-19 test kits, was 3.5%.\nHowever, as\na result of the adverse impact of the cybersecurity incident during the quarter\nended December 30, 2023, our\ninternally generated local currency sales, excluding sales of PPE products\nand COVID-19 test kits, on a full year\nbasis were flat compared to the prior year.\nIn addition, we estimate that sales of PPE products and COVID-19\ntest kits were approximately $713 million and\n$1,245 million for the years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively, representing an\n52\nestimated decrease of $532 million or 42.7%\nversus the prior year, with the $532 million net decrease year-over-\nyear representing 4.2%\nof global net sales for the year ended December 30, 2023.\nDental\nDental net sales for the year ended December 30, 2023 increased 0.9%.\nThe components of our sales growth are\npresented in the table above.\nOur decrease in internally generated local currency sales for dental\nmerchandise was\nprimarily attributable to the negative impact of the cybersecurity incident.\nOur sales decrease in internally\ngenerated local currency for dental equipment was also primarily attributable\nto the impact of the cybersecurity\nincident.\nWe estimate that sales of PPE products were approximately $338 million and $448 million for the years ended\nDecember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, representing an estimated decrease of $110 million or\n24.5% versus the prior year, with the $110 million net decrease year-over-year representing 1.5% of dental net sales\nfor the year ended December 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in sales of PPE products is primarily due to lower\nmarket\nprices and loss of demand during the cybersecurity incident.\nOur estimated internally generated local currency\nsales, excluding PPE products were flat compared to the prior year.\nMedical\nMedical net sales for the year ended December 30, 2023 decreased 10.3%.\nThe components of our sales growth are\npresented in the table above.\nThe internally generated local currency decrease in medical sales\nis primarily\nattributable to the impact of the cybersecurity incident that occurred\nduring the fourth quarter of the year ended\nDecember 30, 2023 and to lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19\ntest kits and other point-of-care diagnostic\nproducts.\nWe estimate that sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits were approximately $375 million and $797 million\nfor the years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, representing an estimated decrease\nof\n$422 million or 52.9% versus the prior year, with the $422 million net decrease year-over-year representing 10.6%\nof medical net sales for the year ended December 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in sales of these products is primarily due\nto lower market prices of PPE, lower market demand of COVID-19\ntest kits, and loss of sales of both product\ncategories during the cybersecurity incident.\nThe estimated decrease in internally generated local currency\nsales,\nexcluding PPE products and COVID-19 test kits was 2.2%.\nTechnology and value-added services\nTechnology and value-added services net sales for the year ended December 30, 2023 increased 11.4%.\nThe\ncomponents of our sales growth are presented in the table above.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, the\ntrend for sales of practice management software growth remains\nstrong as we continued to increase the number of\ncloud-based users.\nWe also experienced increased demand for our revenue cycle management solutions and our\nanalytical products.\nThe increase in sales during the year ended December 30, 2023\nwas partially offset by the\nexpiration, during the year ended December 31, 2022, of a modestly profitable\ngovernment contract in one of our\nvalue-added services businesses.\nThis segment of our business was largely unaffected by the cybersecurity incident\nin the fourth quarter.\nGross Profit\nGross profit and gross margin percentages by segment and in total were as follows:\nGross\nGross\nIncrease / (Decrease)\n2023\nMargin %\n2022\nMargin %\n$\n%\nHealth care distribution\n$\n3,312\n28.7\n%\n$\n3,357\n28.2\n%\n$\n(45)\n(1.3)\n%\nTechnology and value-added services\n549\n68.0\n474\n65.5\n75\n15.7\nTotal\n$\n3,861\n31.3\n$\n3,831\n30.3\n$\n30\n0.8\n53\nAs a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks\nthroughout our\nindustry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.\nAdditionally, we\nrealize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology and value-added services\nsegment than in\nour health care distribution segment.\nThese higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of\nsoftware products and services, as well as certain financial services.\nThe software industry typically realizes higher\ngross margins to recover investments in research and development.\nWithin our health care distribution segment, gross profit margins may vary between the periods as a result of\nthe\nchanges in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer\nmix.\nFor example, sales of our corporate\nbrand and certain specialty products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average\ntotal gross profit\nmargins of all products.\nWith respect to customer mix, sales to our large-group customers are typically completed\nat lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to office-based\npractitioners, who normally purchase lower volumes.\nHealth care distribution gross profit for the year ended December 30, 2023\ndecreased compared to the prior-year-\nperiod due to the decrease in sales resulting from the cybersecurity\nincident and a reduction in sales of PPE\nproducts and COVID-19 test kits, partially offset by gross profit from acquisitions\nand gross margin expansion as a\nresult of a favorable impact of sales mix of higher-margin products.\nTechnology and value-added services gross profit increased as a result of a higher gross profit from internally\ngenerated sales and gross profit from acquisitions, as well as an increase\nin gross margin rates primarily due to\nproduct mix and increases in productivity.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses (consisting of selling, general and administrative\nexpenses; depreciation and amortization,\nrestructuring and integration costs) by segment and in total were as follows:\n% of\n% of\nRespective\nRespective\nIncrease\n2023\nNet Sales\n2022\nNet Sales\n$\n%\nHealth care distribution\n$\n2,842\n24.6\n%\n$\n2,738\n23.0\n%\n$\n104\n3.8\n%\nTechnology and

travel, convention and consulting expenses in both of our reportable\nsegments and increased\nacquisition expenses in our healthcare distribution segment.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, our\noperating expenses were favorably impacted by the recognition of\na remeasurement gain of $18 million following\nan acquisition of a controlling interest of a previously held equity\ninvestment, and were negatively impacted by\nrestructuring, an impairment of capitalized costs of $27 million and impairment\nof intangible assets of $7 million\nwithin our health care distribution segment.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, we also incurred $11\nmillion of direct costs, primarily professional fees, for the remediation of\nthe cybersecurity incident.\nThe\nrestructuring and integration costs are primarily related to severance and\nemployee-related costs, accelerated\namortization of right-of-use lease assets and fixed assets, and other lease exit\ncosts.\n54\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net was as follows:\nVariance\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\nInterest income\n$\n17\n$\n8\n$\n9\n125.1\n%\nInterest expense\n(87)\n(35)\n(52)\n(148.7)\nOther,

to\nincreased borrowings and increased interest rates.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 22.1% for the year ended December 30, 2023 compared to 23.5%\nfor the prior year.\nIn\neach year, the difference between our effective and federal statutory tax rates primarily relates to state and foreign\nincome taxes and interest expense.\nThe Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) issued\ntechnical and administrative\nguidance on Pillar Two Model Rules in December 2021, which provides for a global minimum tax rate on the\nearnings of large multinational businesses, on a country-by-country basis.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the minimum\nglobal tax rate is 15% for various jurisdictions pursuant to the Pillar Two framework.\nFuture tax reform resulting\nfrom these developments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles,\nwhich may adversely impact our\neffective tax rate going forward or result in higher cash tax liabilities.\nAs we operate in jurisdictions which have\nadopted Pillar 2, we are continuing to analyze the implications to effectively manage\nthe impact for 2024 and\nbeyond.\n55\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal capital requirements have included funding of acquisitions, purchases\nof additional noncontrolling\ninterests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs,\npurchases of fixed assets and\nrepurchases of common stock.\nWorking capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special\ninventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables\nand payables.\nHistorically, sales have\ntended to be stronger during the second half of the year and special inventory\nforward buy-in opportunities have\nbeen most prevalent just before the end of the year, and have caused our working capital requirements\nto be higher\nfrom the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of\nthe following year.\nWe finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt\nplacements.\nPlease see\nfor further information.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flows from\noperations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers\nfor our products and services, and access to\nproducts and services from our suppliers.\nOur business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which\nis susceptible to fluctuations during the\nyear as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.\nInventory purchase activity is a function of\nsales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory.\nWe anticipate\nfuture increases in our working capital requirements.\nWe finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months.\nFunding requirements are based on\nforecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may\nchange.\nConsequently, we may change\nour funding structure to reflect any new requirements.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets,\nand our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with\nsufficient liquidity to meet our currently\nforeseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.\nOur acquisition strategy is focused on investments in companies that\nadd new customers and sales teams, increase\nour geographic footprint (whether entering a new country, such as emerging markets, or building scale where we\nhave already invested in businesses), and finally, those that enable us to access new products and technologies.\nAs\npart of our BOLD+1 Strategic Plan, including pursuing focused mergers and acquisitions,\nduring the year ended\nDecember 30, 2023 we have announced acquisitions of companies specializing\nin implant systems, clear aligners,\nhomecare medical products delivered directly to patients, and dental practice\ntransition services.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $500 million for the\nyear ended December 30, 2023, compared to net\ncash provided by operating activities of $602 million for the prior year.\nThe net change of $102 million was\nprimarily attributable to lower cash net income.\nDuring the quarter ended December 30, 2023, the cybersecurity\nincident had several offsetting impacts to the operating cash flows from our working\ncapital, net of acquisitions,\nincluding a decrease in operating cash flows from accounts receivable\ndue to delayed timing of billings and limited\ncollection efforts resulting from the impact of the cybersecurity incident, and an increase\nin operating cash flows\nresulting from reduced inventory purchases.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,135 million for the\nyear ended December 30, 2023, compared to net\ncash used in investing activities of $276 million for the prior year.\nThe net change of $859 million was primarily\nattributable to increased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions,\nand increased purchases of\nfixed assets resulting from our continued investment in our facilities and operations.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $701 million for the year\nended December 30, 2023, compared to net\ncash used in financing activities of $315 million for the prior year.\nThe net change of $1,016 million was primarily\ndue to increased net borrowings from debt\nto finance our investments, partially offset by decreased repurchases of\ncommon stock.\n56\nThe

and investments\nin money market funds representing\novernight investments with a high degree of liquidity.\nAccounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns\nOur accounts receivable days sales outstanding from operations\nincreased to 46.2 days as of December 30, 2023\nfrom 41.9 days as of December 31, 2022 due to delays in billings\nleading to limited collections in the quarter ended\nDecember 30, 2023 as a result of the cybersecurity incident.\nDuring the years ended December 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, we wrote off approximately $16 million and $10 million, respectively, of fully reserved\naccounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve.\nOur inventory turns from operations was 4.5 as of\nDecember 30, 2023 and 4.7 as of December 31, 2022.\nOur working capital accounts may be impacted by current\nand future economic conditions.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations related\nto fixed and variable

less than one year to\napproximately 18 years, some of\nwhich may include options to extend the leases for up to 15 years.\nAs of December 30, 2023, our right-of-use\nassets related to operating leases were $325 million and our current and non-current\noperating lease liabilities were\n$80 million and $310 million, respectively.\nPlease see\nfor further information.\nStock Repurchases\nOn February 8, 2023, our Board authorized the repurchase of up\nto an additional $400 million in shares of our\ncommon stock.\nFrom March 3, 2003 through December 30, 2023, we repurchased $4.7\nbillion, or 90,394,805 shares, under our\ncommon stock repurchase programs, with $265 million available\nas of December 30, 2023 for future common stock\nshare repurchases.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nSome minority stockholders in certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have\nthe right, at certain times, to require us\nto acquire their ownership interest in those entities.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 480-10 is applicable\nfor noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase\nall or a portion of the outstanding interest\nin a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder\nunder the terms of a put option contained in\ncontractual agreements.\nAs of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nour balance for redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests was $864 million and $576 million, respectively.\nPlease see\nfor further information.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nAs more fully disclosed in\nof “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” we cannot\nreasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to our unrecognized\ntax benefits, including accrued\ninterest, of $115 million as of December 30, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in\nof the consolidated financial statements.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us\nto make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues\nand expenses and\nrelated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.\nWe base our estimates on historical data, when available,\nexperience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions\nthat are believed to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of\nassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nWe believe that the estimates, judgments and\nassumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information\navailable to us at the time that these\nestimates, judgments and assumptions are made.\nHowever, by their nature, estimates are subject to various\nassumptions and uncertainties.\nTherefore, reported results may differ from estimates and any such differences may\nbe material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting estimates, which have been discussed with the Audit Committee\nof our Board, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation\nof our consolidated financial\nstatements:\nInventories and Reserves\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at\nthe lower of cost or net realizable value.\nCost is\ndetermined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise and actual cost\nfor large equipment and high tech\nequipment.\nIn estimating carrying value of inventory, we consider many factors including the condition and\n58\nsalability of the inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, historical sales,\nforecasted sales and market and\neconomic trends.\nCertain of our products, specifically PPE and COVID-19 test kits, have experienced\nchanges in\nnet realizable value, due to volatility of pricing and changes in demand\nfor these products.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe estimated fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets (i.e., customer\nrelationships and lists, trademarks\nand trade names, product development and non-compete agreements)\nis based on critical judgments and\nassumptions derived from analysis of market conditions, including discount\nrates, projected revenue growth rates\n(which are based on historical trends and assessment of financial projections),\nestimated customer attrition and\nprojected cash flows.\nThese assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic\nand market\nconditions.\nPlease see\nfor further discussion of our acquisitions.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to impairment analysis at least once annually as\nof the first day of our fourth quarter, or if an\nevent occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than\nnot reduce a reporting unit’s fair value below\ncarrying value.\nWe regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: our global dental and medical\nbusinesses, and technology and value-added services.\nGoodwill is allocated to such reporting units, for the\npurposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification\nbasis.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including\nthe identification of reporting units,\nassignment of assets and liabilities that are considered shared services\nto the reporting units, and ultimately the\ndetermination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nThe fair value of each reporting unit is calculated by\napplying the discounted cash flow methodology and confirming with\na market approach.\nThere are inherent\nuncertainties, however, related to fair value models, the inputs and our judgments in applying them\nto this analysis.\nThe most significant inputs include estimation of detailed future cash flows based\non budget expectations, and\ndetermination of comparable companies to develop a weighted average\ncost of capital for each reporting unit.\nOn an annual basis, we prepare financial projections.\nThese projections are based on input from our leadership and\nare presented annually to our Board.\nInfluences on this year's forecasted financial information and\nthe fair value\nmodel include: the impact of planned strategic initiatives, the continued\nintegration of recent acquisitions and\noverall market conditions.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change\nfrom year to\nyear based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors.\nOur third-party valuation specialists provide inputs into our determination\nof the discount rate.\nThe rate is\ndependent on a number of underlying assumptions, including the risk-free rate,\ntax rate, equity risk premium, debt\nto equity ratio and pre-tax cost of debt.\nLong-term growth rates are applied to our estimation of future cash flows.\nThe long-term growth rates are tied to\ngrowth rates we expect to achieve beyond the years for which we have\nforecasted operating results.\nWe also\nconsider external benchmarks, and other data points which we believe are\napplicable to our industry and the\ncomposition of our global operations.\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023 and December 25, 2021, we believe\nthe fair value of each of our reporting\nunits sufficiently exceeds the carrying values and thus we did not record any amount\nfor goodwill impairment.\nBased on our quantitative assessment for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nwe recorded a $20 million impairment\nof goodwill relating to the disposal of an unprofitable business for which\nestimated fair value was lower than\ncarrying value.\nAs part of our analysis for the rest of the goodwill balance, we performed\na sensitivity analysis on\nthe discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions.\nThe sensitivities did not result in any additional\nimpairment charges.\n59\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAnnually or if we identify an impairment indicator,\ndefinite-lived intangible assets such as non-compete\nagreements, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships and lists, and\nproduct development are reviewed for\nimpairment indicators.\nIf any impairment indicators exist, quantitative testing\nis performed on the asset.\nThe quantitative impairment model is a two-step test under which we\nfirst calculate the recoverability of the\ncarrying value by comparing the undiscounted projected cash flows associated\nwith the asset or asset group,\nincluding its estimated residual value, to the carrying amount.\nIf the cash flows associated with the asset or asset\ngroup are less than the carrying value, we perform a fair value assessment\nof the asset, or asset group.\nIf the\ncarrying amount is found to be greater than the fair value, we record an\nimpairment loss for the excess of book\nvalue over the fair value.\nIn addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful\nlives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.\nAlthough we believe our judgments, estimates and/or\nassumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value\nare reasonable, making material changes to\nsuch judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect such impairment\nanalyses and our financial\nresults.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023 we recorded $19 million of\nimpairment charges related to businesses in\nour health care distribution segment, the components of which were\n$7 million primarily related to customer lists\nand relationships attributable to lower than anticipated operating\nmargins in certain businesses, and a $12 million\ncharge related to the planned exit of a business.\nThese impairment charges were calculated as the differences\nbetween the carrying values and the estimated fair values of the impaired\nintangible assets, using a discounted\nestimate of future cash flows.\nPlease see\nfor additional\ndetails.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022 we recorded $49 million of\nimpairment charges related to businesses in\nour health care distribution segment, the components of which were\na $15 million charge related to the disposal of\nan unprofitable business and a $34 million charge related to customer lists and relationships\nattributable to\ncustomer attrition rates being higher than expected in certain other\nhealth care distribution businesses.\nThese\nimpairment charges were calculated as the differences between the carrying values and the\nestimated fair values of\nthe impaired intangible assets, using a discounted estimate of future\ncash flows.\nPlease see\nfor additional details.\nDuring the year ended December 25, 2021, we recorded a $1 million\nimpairment charge related ratably to a\nbusiness within our health care distribution segment and a business within\nour technology and value-added services\nsegment.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nSome minority stockholders in certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have\nthe right, at certain times, to require us\nto acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.\nThe redemption amounts have been estimated\nbased on recent transactions, expected future earnings and cash flows\nand, if such earnings and cash flows are not\nachieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests might be impacted.\nSee\nand\nfor additional\ninformation.\nIncome Tax\nWhen determining if the realization of a deferred tax asset is likely to assess\nthe need to record a valuation\nallowance, estimates and judgement are required.\nWe\nconsider all available evidence, both positive and negative,\nincluding estimated future taxable earnings, ongoing planning strategies,\nfuture reversals of existing temporary\ndifferences and historical operating results.\nAdditionally, changes to tax laws and statutory tax rates can have an\nimpact on our determination.\nOur intention is to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly.\nASC Topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in\naccordance with provisions contained within its guidance.\nThis topic prescribes a recognition threshold and a\nmeasurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement\nof tax positions taken or expected to\n60\nbe taken in a tax return.\nFor those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more\nlikely than not to be\nsustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.\nThe amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of\nbenefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\naudit settlement.\nIn the normal\ncourse of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various\ntaxing authorities.\nSuch examinations may\nresult in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain\ntax positions taken in respect of\ncertain tax matters.\nPlease see\nfor further discussion.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-\nTaxed Income (“GILTI”),\nstates that an entity can make an accounting policy election to\neither recognize deferred\ntaxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related\nto GILTI in the year the tax is incurred.\nWe have elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the\nperiod the tax is incurred.\nAccounting Standards Update\nFor a discussion of accounting standards updates that have been adopted\nor will be adopted in the future, please see\nincluded under Item 8."

    "text": "We are exposed to market risks, interest rate risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as\nmeasured against the U.S. dollar and each other, and changes to the credit markets.\nWe attempt to minimize these\nrisks primarily by using foreign currency forward contracts and by\nmaintaining counter-party credit limits.\nThese\nhedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange\nand credit risks.\nFactors that could\ninfluence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and\navailability of hedging\ninstruments and liquidity of the credit markets.\nAll foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are\ncomponents of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose\nof hedging an existing or anticipated\ncurrency exposure.\nWe do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by\ndiversifying our investments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and having\nmultiple sources of capital.\nForeign Currency\nThe value of certain foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar may\naffect our financial results.\nFluctuations in\nexchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses\nand retained\nearnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.\nWhere we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs\nusing primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting\nthe impact of foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations on earnings.\nWe purchase short-term (i.e., generally 18 months or less) foreign currency forward\ncontracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany\nloans due from our international\nsubsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign\nsuppliers.\nWe do not hedge the translation of\nforeign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we consider foreign\ncurrency translation to be an accounting exposure,\nnot an economic exposure.\nA hypothetical 5% change in the average value of the U.S. dollar in 2023 compared\nto\nforeign currencies would have changed our 2023 reported Net income\nattributable to Henry Schein, Inc. by\napproximately $5 million.\nAs of December 30, 2023, our forward foreign currency exchange agreements,\nwhich expire through November 3,\n2028, had a fair value of $(8) million as determined by quoted market prices.\nIncluded in the forward foreign\ncurrency exchange agreements, Henry Schein, Inc. had net investment\ndesignated EUR/USD forward contracts\nwith notional values of approximately €300 million and reported fair values\nof $(7) million.\nA 5% increase in the\nvalue of the Euro to the USD from December 30, 2023 would decrease the fair\nvalue of these forward contracts by\n$18 million.\nTotal\nReturn Swaps\nOn March 20, 2020, we entered into a total return swap for the purpose\nof economically hedging our unfunded non-\nqualified supplemental retirement plan and our deferred compensation plan obligation.\n61\nAt inception, the notional value of the investments in these plans was $43\nmillion.\nAt December 30, 2023, the\nnotional value of the investments in these plans was $96 million.\nAt December 30, 2023, the financing blended rate\nfor this swap was based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)\nof 5.33%\nplus 0.52%, for a combined\nrate of 5.85%.\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and\nDecember 25, 2021 we have\nrecorded a gain/(loss), within selling, general and administrative expense,\nof approximately $10 million, $(17)\nmillion and $12 million, respectively, net of transaction costs, related to this undesignated swap.\nThis swap is\nexpected to be renewed on an annual basis and is expected to result\nin a neutral impact to our results of operations.\nCredit Risk Monitoring\nWe limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivative instruments, by\nmonitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are\nthe counterparties to such financial\ninstruments.\nAs a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing\nnumerous investment grade counterparties.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 30, 2023, we had variable interest rate exposure for certain\nof our revolving credit facilities and\nour U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization.\nOur revolving credit facility which we entered into on July 11,\n2023 and expires on July 11, 2028,\nhas a variable\ninterest rate that is based on the SOFR plus a spread based on our leverage\nratio at the end of each financial\nreporting quarter.\nAs of December 30, 2023, there was $200 million outstanding under\nthis revolving credit\nfacility.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, the average outstanding\nbalance was approximately $61\nmillion.\nBased upon our average outstanding balances, for each hypothetical\nincrease of 25 basis points, our\ninterest expense thereunder would have increased by $0.2 million.\nOur U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization, which we entered\ninto on April 17, 2013 and expires on\nDecember 15, 2025, has a variable interest rate that is based upon the asset-backed\ncommercial paper rate.\nAs of\nDecember 30, 2023, the commercial paper rate was 5.67% plus 0.75%,\nfor a combined rate of 6.42%,\nand the\noutstanding balance under this securitization facility was $210 million.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023,\nthe average outstanding balance was approximately $238 million.\nBased upon our average outstanding balances,\nfor each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points, our interest expense thereunder\nwould have increased by $1\nmillion.\nOn July 11, 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flow of our variable\nrate $750\nmillion floating debt term loan facility, with three years maturity, effectively changing the floating rate portion of\nour obligation to a fixed rate.\nUnder the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we receive variable\ninterest\npayments based on the one-month Term SOFR rate and pay interest at a fixed rate.\nAs of December 30, 2023, the\nnotional value of the interest rate swap agreements was $741\nmillion.\nThis term loan matures on July 11, 2026.\nAt December 30, 2023, the interest on this Term Credit Agreement was 5.36% plus 1.35% for a combined rate of\n6.71%.\nHowever, we have a hedge in place (see\nfor additional\ninformation) that ultimately creates an effective fixed rate of 5.79%.\n62"

millions, except share and per share data)\n70\nNote 1 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nWe distribute health care products and services primarily to office-based dental and medical practitioners, across\ndental practices, laboratories, physician practices, and ambulatory surgery centers,\nas well as government,\ninstitutional health care clinics and alternate care clinics.\nWe also provide software, technology and other value-\nadded services to health care practitioners.\nOur dental businesses serve office-based dental practitioners, dental\nlaboratories, schools, government and other institutions.\nOur medical businesses serve physician offices, urgent\ncare centers, ambulatory care sites, emergency medical technicians, dialysis centers,\nhome health, federal and state\ngovernments and large enterprises, such as group practices and integrated delivery\nnetworks, among other providers\nacross a wide range of specialties.\nWe have operations or affiliates in the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the\nCzech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg,\nMalaysia, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal,\nSingapore, South Africa, Spain,\nSweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry\nSchein, Inc. and all of our controlled\nsubsidiaries.\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nInvestments in\nunconsolidated affiliates for which we have the ability to influence the operating or\nfinancial decisions are\naccounted for under the equity method.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform\nto the\ncurrent period presentation.\nThese reclassifications, individually and in the aggregate, did not\nhave a material\nimpact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations\nor cash flows.\nWe consolidate the results of operations and financial position of a trade accounts receivable securitization which\nwe consider a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) because we are its primary beneficiary as we have the power to\ndirect activities that most significantly affect its economic performance and have\nthe obligation to absorb the\nmajority of its losses or benefits.\nFor this VIE, the trade accounts receivable transferred\nto the VIE are pledged as\ncollateral to the related debt.\nThe VIE’s creditors have recourse to us for losses on these trade accounts receivable.\nAt December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\ncertain trade accounts receivable that can only be used to settle\nobligations of this VIE were $\n284\nmillion and $\n327\nmillion, respectively, and the liabilities of this VIE where the\ncreditors have recourse to us were $\n210\nmillion and $\n255\nmillion, respectively.\nFair Value\nMeasurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe fair value hierarchy distinguishes between\n(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained\nfrom independent sources (observable\ninputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best\ninformation available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).\nThe fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the\nhighest priority to unadjusted quoted prices\nin active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority\nto unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:\n•\nLevel 1— Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets\nor liabilities that are accessible at the\nmeasurement date.\n•\nLevel 2— Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are\nobservable for the asset or liability,\neither directly or indirectly.\nLevel 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities\nin active markets;\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n71\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; inputs other than quoted\nprices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are\nderived principally from or corroborated by\nobservable market data by correlation or other means.\n•\nLevel 3— Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.\nSee\nfor additional information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions\nmade by us that affect, among other things,\nour goodwill, long-lived asset and definite-lived intangible asset valuation;\ninventory valuation; equity investment\nvaluation; assessment of the annual effective tax rate; valuation of deferred income\ntaxes and income tax\ncontingencies; the allowance for doubtful accounts; redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests; hedging activity; supplier\nrebates; measurement of compensation cost for certain share-based\nperformance awards and cash bonus plans; and\npension plan assumptions.\nFiscal Year\nWe report our results of operations and cash flows on a\n52\nor\n53\nweeks per fiscal year basis ending on the last\nSaturday of December.\nThe year ended December 30, 2023 consisted of\n52\nweeks, and the years ended December\n31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 consisted of\n53\nweeks and\n52\nweeks, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods\nor services in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration that we expect to receive for those goods or services.\nTo recognize revenue, we:\n•\nidentify the contract(s) with a customer;\n•\nidentify the performance obligations in the contract;\n•\ndetermine the transaction price;\n•\nallocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;\nand\n•\nrecognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of dental and medical consumable products, equipment (Health care distribution\nrevenues), software products and services and other sources (Technology and value-added services revenues).\nProvisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other\ncontra revenue adjustments are included\nin the transaction price at contract inception by estimating the most likely\namount based upon historical data and\nestimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are\nrecognized.\nRevenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized at the\npoint in time when control transfers to\nthe customer.\nSuch sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders\nshipped using third-party common\ncarriers.\nWe believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating control has transferred\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n72\nto the customer.\nOn the shipment date, we have no post-shipment obligations,\nlegal title and risks and rewards of\nownership transfer to the customer and we have an enforceable right\nto payment.\nRevenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when control\ntransfers to the customer.\nThis occurs\nwhen the equipment is delivered.\nSuch sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily\nby\nequipment service technicians.\nMost equipment requires minimal installation, which is\ntypically completed at the\ntime of delivery.\nOur product generally carries standard warranty terms provided\nby the manufacturer; however, in\ninstances where we provide warranty labor services, the warranty costs\nare accrued in accordance with Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 460 Guarantees.\nAt December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had\naccrued approximately $\n12\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion, respectively, for warranty costs.\nRevenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when\nproducts are delivered to customers or\nmade available electronically.\nSuch software is generally installed by customers and does\nnot require extensive\ntraining.\nRevenue derived from post-contract customer support for software,\nincluding annual support and/or\ntraining, is generally recognized over time using time elapsed as the input method\nthat best depicts the transfer of\ncontrol to the customer.\nRevenue derived from software sold on a Software-as-a-Service\nbasis is recognized ratably\nover the subscription period as control is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue derived from other sources, including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial\nservices, is\nrecognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when\nthe services are provided.\nWe apply the\npractical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities performed after\nthe customer obtains control as\nfulfillment activities, rather than a separate performance obligation in the\ncontract.\nSales, value-add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing\nactivities are excluded from\nrevenue.\nSome of our revenue is derived from bundled arrangements that include\nmultiple distinct performance obligations,\nwhich are accounted for separately.\nWhen we sell software products together with related services (i.e.,\ntraining\nand technical support), we allocate revenue to software by the residual\nmethod, using an estimate of the standalone\nselling price to estimate the fair value of the undelivered elements.\nBundled arrangements that include elements\nthat are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related\ninstallation service.\nWe allocate\nrevenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the goods\nor services.\nIf an observable selling\nprice is not available (i.e., because we or others do not sell the goods or\nservices separately), we use one of the\nfollowing techniques to estimate the standalone selling price: adjusted\nmarket approach; cost-plus approach; or the\nresidual method.\nThere is no specific hierarchy for the use of these methods,\nbut the estimated selling price reflects\nour best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be\nif it were sold regularly on a standalone\nbasis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business, technical skill\nrequired, customer location and\nother market conditions.\nSee\nfor additional disclosures of disaggregated net sales and\nfor disclosures of net sales by segment and geographic data.\nSales Returns\nSales returns are recognized as a reduction of revenue by the amount\nof expected returns and are recorded as refund\nliability within accrued expenses-other within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe estimate the sales return\nliability based on historical data for specific products, adjusted as necessary\nfor new products.\nThe allowance for\nreturns is presented gross as a refund liability and we record an inventory\nasset (and a corresponding adjustment to\ncost of sales) for any products that we expect to be returned\nand resaleable.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n73\nCost of Sales\nThe primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product\n(net of purchase discounts, supplier\nchargebacks and rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges.\nCosts related to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing,\ninternal inventory transfers and other costs of our\ndistribution network are included in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses along with other operating costs.\nTotal distribution network costs were $\n105\nmillion, $\n103\nmillion and $\n89\nmillion for the years ended December 30,\n2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively.\nSupplier Rebates\nSupplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized\nover the period they are earned.\nThe\nfactors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted\ninventory purchases,\nsales, supplier\nrebate contract terms, which generally provide for increasing rebates based\non either increased purchase or sales\nvolumes.\nDirect Shipping and Handling Costs\nFreight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales.\nDirect handling costs, which represent\nprimarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise\nprepare, if necessary, merchandise\nfor shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses.\nDirect handling costs\nwere $\n98\nmillion, $\n96\nmillion and $\n97\nmillion for the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022\nand\nDecember 25, 2021, respectively.\nAdvertising and Promotional Costs\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred.\nTotal advertising and promotional expenses were $\n47\nmillion, $\n47\nmillion and $\n48\nmillion for the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and\nDecember\n25, 2021, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Costs\nWe\nmeasure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated\nfair value of the award, and\nrecognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense on\na straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period for time-based restricted stock units and on a graded vesting\nbasis for the option awards.\nFor\nperformance-based awards, at each reporting date, we reassess whether achievement\nof the performance condition\nis probable and accrue compensation expense when achievement of\nthe performance condition is probable.\nOur\nstock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses.\nEmployment Benefit Plans and other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nSome of our employees in our international markets participate\nin various noncontributory defined benefit plans.\nWe recognize the funded status, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected\nbenefit obligation.\nEach unfunded plan is recognized as a liability and each funded\nplan is recognized as either an\nasset or liability based on its funded status.\nWe measure our plan assets and liabilities at the end of our fiscal year.\nNet periodic pension costs and valuations are dependent on assumptions\nused by third-party actuaries in calculating\nthose amounts.\nThese assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan\nassets, rate of future\ncompensation levels, retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors.\nWe record the service cost component of\nnet pension cost in selling, general and administrative expenses within\nour consolidated statements of income.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n74\nGains and losses that result from changes in actuarial assumptions or\nfrom actual experience that differs from\nactuarial assumptions are recognized in and then amortized from Accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss).\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash\nequivalents.\nDue to the short-term maturity of such investments,\nthe carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of\nfair value.\nOutstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit of $\n52\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion, primarily related to\npayments for inventory, were classified as accounts payable as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are generally recognized when health care distribution\nand technology and value-added\nservices revenues are recognized.\nIn accordance with the “expected credit loss” model, the carrying amount\nof\naccounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects\nour best estimate of the amounts that we do\nnot expect to collect.\nIn addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many\nfactors in\nestimating our reserve, including types of customers and their credit worthiness,\nexperience and historical data\nadjusted for current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts.\nWe\nrecord allowances for credit losses based upon a specific review of all\nsignificant outstanding invoices.\nFor\nthose invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates,\nbased upon the age of the\nreceivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region\nthat the receivable was recorded in, current\neconomic trends and reasonable supportable forecasts.\nWe\nwrite-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded\nallowance when we deem them uncollectible.\nOur net accounts receivable balance was $\n1,863\nmillion, $\n1,442\nmillion, and $\n1,452\nmillion at December 30, 2023,\nDecember 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, respectively.\nOur allowance for credit losses was $\n83\nmillion, $\n65\nmillion $\n67\nmillion, and $\n88\nmillion as of December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021,\nand\nDecember 26, 2020, respectively.\nAdditions to the allowance for the years ended December 30, 2023,\nDecember\n31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were $\n34\nmillion, $\n8\nmillion and $\n0\nmillion, respectively.\nDeductions to the\nallowance for the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022\nand December 25, 2021, were $\n16\nmillion,\n$\n10\nmillion and $\n21\nmillion\n, respectively.\nContract Assets\nContract assets include amounts related to any conditional right to consideration\nfor work completed but not billed\nas of the reporting date.\nContract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when\nthe right becomes\nunconditional.\nThe contract assets primarily relate to our bundled arrangements for\nthe sale of equipment and\nconsumables and sales of term software licenses.\nCurrent contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and\nother and the non-current contract assets are included in investments and other\nwithin our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nCurrent and non-current contract asset balances as of December 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 were not\nmaterial.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities are comprised of advance payments and upfront payments\nfor service arrangements provided\nover time that are accounted for as deferred revenue amounts.\nContract liabilities are transferred to revenue once\nthe performance obligation has been satisfied.\nCurrent contract liabilities are included in accrued expenses: other\nand the non-current contract liabilities are included in other liabilities\nwithin our consolidated balance sheets.\nAt\nDecember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the current and non-current contract\nliabilities were $\n89\nmillion and\n$\n9\nmillion, and $\n86\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion, respectively. During the year ended December 30, 2023, we recognized\nsubstantially all of the current contract liability amounts that were previously\ndeferred at December 31, 2022.\nAt\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n75\nDecember 25, 2021, the current and non-current contract liabilities were\n$\n89\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion.\nDuring the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, we recognized substantially all of the current\ncontract liability amounts that were\npreviously deferred at December 25, 2021.\nCurrent contract liabilities at December 30, 2023 included\nbalances of\n$\n9\nmillion related to business acquisitions completed in 2023.\nAcquisition-related contract liability amounts at\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were immaterial.\nInventories and Reserves\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at\nthe lower of cost or net realizable value.\nCost is\ndetermined by the weighted-average first-in, first-out method for merchandise\nand by actual cost for large\nequipment and high tech equipment.\nIn accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we consider\nmany\nfactors including the condition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and\neconomic trends.\nFrom time to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated\nchanges in any of these or other\nfactors expected to affect the value of inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or\namortization.\nDepreciation is\ncomputed under the straight-line method\nusing estimated useful lives (See\nfor estimated useful lives).\nAmortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line\nmethod\nover the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nCapitalized internal-use software costs consist of costs to purchase and\ndevelop software.\nFor software to be used\nsolely to meet internal needs and for cloud-based applications used to deliver\nour services, we capitalize costs\nincurred during the application development stage and include such costs within\nproperty and equipment, net within\nour consolidated balance sheets.\nFor software to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, we capitalize\nsoftware development costs when technological feasibility is reached and\ninclude such costs within investments and\nother within our consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\nWe\ndetermine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception.\nAn arrangement contains a lease if it implicitly or\nexplicitly identifies an asset to be used and conveys the right to control\nthe use of the identified asset in exchange\nfor consideration.\nAs a lessee, we include operating leases in operating lease right-of-use\n(“ROU”) assets,\noperating lease liabilities, and non-current operating lease liabilities in our\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nFinance\nleases are included in property and equipment, current maturities of\nlong-term debt, and long-term debt in our\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease\nterm and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized\nupon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments\nover the lease term.\nAs most of\nour leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we generally use our incremental\nborrowing rate based on the\nestimated rate of interest for fully collateralized and fully amortizing borrowings\nover a similar term of the lease\npayments at commencement date to determine the present value of\nlease payments.\nWhen readily determinable, we\nuse the implicit rate.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably\ncertain that we will exercise that option.\nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis\nover the lease term.\nExpenses associated with operating leases and finance leases\nare included in selling, general\nand administrative and interest expense, respectively within our consolidated\nstatement of income.\nShort-term\nleases with a term of 12 months or less are not capitalized.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n76\nWe\nhave lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are\ngenerally accounted for as a single\nlease component, except non-lease components for leases of vehicles, which\nare accounted for separately.\nWhen a\nvehicle lease contains both lease and non-lease components, we allocate the\ntransaction price based on the relative\nstandalone selling price.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nWe account for business acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting, under which\nthe net assets of\nacquired businesses are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition\ndate and our consolidated financial statements\ninclude the acquired businesses’ results of operations from that date.\nSome prior owners of acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional\npurchase price cash consideration, or\nwe may be entitled to recoup a portion of purchase price cash consideration\nif certain financial targets are met.\nWe\nhave accrued liabilities for the estimated fair value of additional purchase\nprice consideration at the time of the\nacquisition, using the income approach, including a probability-weighted\ndiscounted cash flow method or an option\npricing method, where applicable.\nAny adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded\nin selling, general and\nadministrative within our consolidated statements of income.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the\nacquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject\nto refinement.\nAs a result, within\n12 months\nfollowing the date of acquisition, or the measurement period, we\nmay record adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill within our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nAt the end of\nthe measurement period or final determination of the values of such assets\nacquired or liabilities assumed,\nwhichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized\nin our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill\nAny excess of acquisition consideration over the fair value of identifiable\nnet assets acquired is recorded as\ngoodwill.\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits\narising from other assets acquired in a\nbusiness combination that are not individually identified and separately\nrecognized, such as future customers and\ntechnology, as well as the assembled workforce.\nGoodwill represents, for acquired business, the excess of the purchase price\nover the estimated fair value of the net\nassets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible\nassets.\nGoodwill is subject to impairment\nanalysis annually or more frequently if needed.\nSuch impairment analyses for goodwill requires a comparison\nof\nthe fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.\nWe regard our reporting units to be our operating segments:\nglobal dental; global medical; and technology and value-added services.\nGoodwill was allocated to such reporting\nunits, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on\na specific identification basis.\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we tested goodwill\nfor impairment, on the first\nday of the fourth quarter, using a quantitative analysis comparing the carrying value of our reporting\nunits,\nincluding goodwill, to their estimated fair values using a discounted\ncash flow methodology.\nWhen the estimated\nfair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the\nreporting unit is considered not\nimpaired.\nConversely, when a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge against\ngoodwill, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit, is recognized.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including\nthe identification of reporting units,\nassignment of assets and liabilities that are considered shared services\nto the reporting units, and ultimately the\ndetermination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nThe fair value of each reporting unit is calculated by\napplying the discounted cash flow methodology and confirming with\na market approach.\nThere are inherent\nuncertainties related to fair value models, the inputs and our judgments\nin applying them to this analysis.\nThe most\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n77\nsignificant inputs include estimation of future cash flows based on budget\nexpectations, and determination of\ncomparable companies to develop a weighted average cost of capital for each\nreporting unit.\nFor the year ended December 30, 2023 and December 25, 2021, the results of\nour goodwill impairment analysis did\nno\nt result in any impairments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 we recorded a $\n20\nmillion impairment of\ngoodwill relating to the disposal of an unprofitable business whose\nestimated fair value was lower than its carrying\nvalue.\nThe disposal of this business is part of our restructuring initiative\nas more fully discussed in\nIntangible Assets\nIn connection with our business acquisitions, the major classes of\nassets and liabilities to which we generally\nallocate acquisition consideration to, excluding goodwill, include\nidentifiable intangible assets (i.e., customer\nrelationships and lists, trademarks and trade names, product development\nand non-compete agreements), inventory\nand accounts receivable.\nThe estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets\nis based on critical judgments\nand assumptions derived from analysis of market conditions, including\ndiscount rates, projected revenue growth\nrates (which are based on historical trends and assessment of financial projections),\nestimated customer attrition and\nprojected cash flows.\nWe have calculated the value of these intangible assets using the multi-period excess\nearnings method, the relief-from-royalty method, and the with and without\nmethod, where applicable.\nThese\nassumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and\nmarket conditions.\nIntangible assets, other than goodwill, are evaluated for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable\nthrough the undiscounted future cash flows\nexpected to be derived from such asset or asset group.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements,\ntrademarks, trade names, customer\nlists, customer relationships and product development.\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses\nare only recorded if the asset or asset groups carrying amount is not recoverable\nthrough its undiscounted future\ncash flows.\nWe measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the\nestimated fair value.\nWhen an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.\nDuring the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022\nand December 25, 2021, we recorded total\nimpairment charges, within the selling, general and administrative line of our consolidated statements\nof income, on\nintangible assets of $\n7\nmillion, $\n34\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion, respectively, as more fully discussed in\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred income\ntax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events\nthat have been recognized in our\nfinancial statements or tax returns.\nIn estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected\nfuture\nevents other than expected enactments of changes in tax laws or rates.\nThe effect on deferred income tax assets and\nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in\nthe period that includes the enactment date.\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries\n.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nSome minority stockholders in certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have\nthe right, at certain times, to require us\nto acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.\nTheir interests in these subsidiaries are classified\noutside permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets and are\ncarried at the estimated redemption amounts.\nThe redemption amounts have been estimated based on expected future\nearnings and cash flows and, if such\nearnings and cash flows are not achieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests might be impacted.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n78\nChanges in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling\ninterests subject to put options are reflected at\neach reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in\ncapital.\nFuture reductions in the\ncarrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the\nfair value of the redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests at the time they were originally recorded.\nThe recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests\ncannot go below the floor level.\nAdjustments to the carrying amount of noncontrolling interests\nto\nreflect a fair value redemption feature do not impact the calculation of\nearnings per share.\nOur net income is\nreduced by the portion of the subsidiaries’ net income that is attributable\nto redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interest represents the ownership interests of certain\nminority owners of our consolidated\nsubsidiaries.\nOur net income is reduced by the portion of the subsidiaries’\nnet income that is attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the\nUnited States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded\ndirectly as an adjustment to\nstockholders’ equity.\nOur comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income,\nforeign currency\ntranslation gain (loss), unrealized gain (loss) from hedging activities\nand unrealized pension adjustment gain.\nRisk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest\nrates, and our unfunded non-qualified supplemental retirement plan (“SERP”)\nand our deferred compensation plan\n(“DCP”).\nOur objective is to manage the impact that foreign currency\nexchange rate fluctuations could have on\nrecognized asset and liability fair values, earnings and cash flows, as well\nas our net investments in foreign\nsubsidiaries, the interest rate risk on variable rate debt, and the returns on\nour SERP and DCP.\nOur risk\nmanagement policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be\neffective at reducing the risks associated\nwith the exposure being hedged and be designated hedges at inception\nof the contracts.\nWe do not enter into\nderivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nOur derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency\nforward contracts, total return swaps, and interest rate swaps.\nForeign currency forward agreements related to forecasted inventory\npurchase commitments with foreign suppliers,\nforeign currency swaps related to foreign currency denominated debt, and\ninterest rate swaps related to variable rate\ndebt are designated as cash flow hedges.\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges,\nthe\nchanges in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded as a\ncomponent of Accumulated other comprehensive\nincome in stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into\nearnings in the period(s) during which the hedged\ntransactions affect earnings.\nWe classify the cash flows related to our hedging activities in the same category in our\nconsolidated statements of cash flows as the cash flows related\nto the hedged item.\nForeign currency forward contracts related to our euro-denominated\nforeign operations are designated as net\ninvestment hedges.\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as net investment\nhedges, changes in the fair\nvalue of the derivatives are recorded in the foreign currency translation gain\n(loss) component of Accumulated\nother comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity until the net\ninvestment is sold or substantially liquidated.\nInterest swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of hedging\nthe cash flow of our variable interest rate term\nloan.\nOur foreign currency forward agreements related to foreign currency\nbalance sheet exposure provide economic\nhedges but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n79\nFor agreements not designated as hedges, changes in the value of the derivative,\nalong with the transaction gain or\nloss on the hedged item, are recorded in other, net, within our consolidated statements of income.\nTotal return swaps are entered into for the purpose of economically hedging our SERP and DCP.\nThese swaps are\nexpected to be renewed on an annual basis.\nChanges in the fair values of these total return swaps are recorded in\nselling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated\nstatements of income and offset recognized\nchanges in the fair values of our SERP and DCP liabilities.\nForeign Currency Translation\nand Transactions\nThe financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries\nare determined using local currencies as\nthe functional currencies.\nAssets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange\nrate in effect at\neach year-end.\nIncome statement accounts are translated at the average rate\nof exchange prevailing during the year.\nTranslation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included\nin\nAccumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.\nGains and losses resulting from foreign\ncurrency transactions are included in earnings.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, we adopted ASC Topic 848,\n“Reference Rate Reform” (Topic 848):\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”\nwhich provides optional expedients\nand exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and\nother transactions affected by the\ndiscontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate or by another reference rate\nexpected to be discontinued\nbecause of reference rate reform.\nThe adoption of Topic 848 did not have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nOn December 26, 2021 we adopted Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) No. 2021 – 08,\n“Accounting for\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers” (Subtopic 805).\nASU 2021 – 08 requires\nan acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired\nin a business combination in\naccordance with ASU No. 2014 - 09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”\n(Topic 606).\nAt the acquisition\ndate, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance\nwith Topic 606 as if it had\noriginated the contracts.\nTo achieve this, an acquirer may assess how the acquiree applied Topic 606 to determine\nwhat to record for the acquired revenue contracts.\nGenerally, this should result in an acquirer recognizing and\nmeasuring the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how\nthey were recognized and\nmeasured in the acquiree’s financial statements.\nOur adoption of ASU 2021 - 08 did not have a material impact on\nour consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 27, 2020 we adopted ASU No. 2019-12,\n“Income Taxes” (Topic\n740): Simplifying the Accounting\nfor Income Taxes\n(“ASU 2019-12”).\nASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by\nremoving certain\nexceptions to the general principles in Topic 740.\nThe amendments also improve consistent application of and\nsimplify U.S. GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance.\nOur adoption of\nASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-09, “\nIncome Taxes\n(Topic 740): Improvements to\nIncome Tax Disclosures\n,” which requires public business entities to disclose\nadditional information in specified categories with respect to\nthe reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the\nstatutory rate for federal, state, and foreign income taxes.\nIt also requires greater detail about individual reconciling\nitems in the rate reconciliation to the extent the impact of those items\nexceeds a specified threshold.\nIn addition to\nnew disclosures associated with the rate reconciliation, the ASU requires\ninformation pertaining to taxes paid (net\nof refunds received) to be disaggregated for federal, state, and foreign\ntaxes and further disaggregated for specific\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n80\njurisdictions to the extent the related amounts exceed a quantitative threshold.\nThe ASU also describes items that\nneed to be disaggregated based on their nature, which is determined by\nreference to the item’s fundamental or\nessential characteristics, such as the transaction or event that triggered\nthe establishment of the reconciling item and\nthe activity with which the reconciling item is associated.\nThe ASU eliminates the historic requirement that entities\ndisclose information concerning unrecognized tax benefits having a reasonable\npossibility of significantly\nincreasing or decreasing in the 12 months following the reporting date.\nThis ASU is effective for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024.\nEarly adoption is permitted for annual financial statements\nthat have not yet\nbeen issued or made available for issuance.\nThis ASU should be applied on a prospective basis; however,\nretrospective application is permitted.\nWe are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2023 – 09 will have on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegments\n,” which aims to improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure\nof incremental segment information\non an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to\ndevelop more decision-useful financial\nanalyses.\nCurrently, Topic\n280 requires that a public entity disclose certain information about its\nreportable\nsegments.\nFor example, a public entity is required to report a measure of\nsegment profit or loss that the CODM\nuses to assess segment performance and make decisions about allocating\nresources.\nTopic 280 also requires other\nspecified segment items and amounts, such as depreciation, amortization,\nand depletion expense, to be disclosed\nunder certain circumstances.\nThe amendments in this ASU do not change or remove those disclosure\nrequirements\nand do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments,\naggregates those operating segments, or\napplies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments.\nThis ASU is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024.\nEarly adoption is permitted.\nWe do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2023 – 07 will have a material impact\non our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2 – Cybersecurity Incident\nIn October 2023 Henry Schein experienced a cybersecurity incident that\nprimarily affected the operations of our\nNorth American and European dental and medical distribution businesses.\nHenry Schein One, our practice\nmanagement software, revenue cycle management and patient relationship\nmanagement solutions business, was not\naffected, and our manufacturing businesses were mostly unaffected.\nWe reported the incident to law enforcement\nauthorities, restored affected systems and applications, our distribution operations\nresumed and we reactivated our\necommerce platform. Subsequently, on or about November 8, 2023, we determined that the threat actor obtained\npersonal and sensitive information maintained on our systems belonging\nto certain third parties and since that date\nwe have notified affected and potentially affected parties as appropriate.\nThe scope of personal and sensitive data\nimpacted is still under investigation.\nOn November 22, 2023, we experienced a disruption\nof our ecommerce\nplatform and related applications, which has since been remediated.\nThe incident adversely impacted our financial\nresults for the fourth quarter and full year 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, we incurred $\n11\nmillion of expenses directly related to the\ncybersecurity incident, mostly consisting of professional fees.\nWe maintain

our debt (including bank credit lines, current maturities\nof long-term debt and long-term debt) is\nbased on Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, and as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was\nestimated at $\n2,351\nmillion and $\n1,149\nmillion, respectively.\nFactors that we considered when estimating the fair\nvalue of our debt include market conditions, such as interest rates and credit\nspreads.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and\nsignificant other observable inputs.\nOur derivative\ninstruments primarily include foreign currency forward agreements, forecasted\ninventory purchase commitments,\nforeign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, and total return\nswaps.\nThe fair values for the majority of our foreign currency derivative contracts\nare obtained by comparing our contract\nrate to a published forward price of the underlying market rates, which\nare based on market rates for comparable\ntransactions that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe fair value of the interest rate swap, which is classified within Level 2\nof the fair value hierarchy, is determined\nby comparing our contract rate to a forward market rate as of the\nvaluation date.\nThe fair value of total return swaps is determined by valuing the underlying\nexchange traded funds of the swap\nusing market-on-close pricing by industry providers as of the valuation\ndate that are classified within Level 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\nThe values for redeemable noncontrolling interests are based on recent\ntransactions and/or implied multiples of\nearnings that are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nSee\nfor

financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of\ncredit risk.\nThese financial instruments\nconsist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables, long-term investments,\nnotes receivable and derivative\ninstruments.\nIn all cases, our maximum exposure to loss from credit\nrisk equals the gross fair value of the financial\ninstruments.\nWe routinely maintain cash balances at financial institutions in excess of insured amounts.\nWe have\nnot experienced any loss in such accounts and we manage this risk through\nmaintaining cash deposits and other\nhighly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions.\nWe continuously assess the need for reserves for\nsuch losses, which have been within our expectations.\nWe do not require collateral or other security to support\nfinancial instruments subject to credit risk, except for long-term notes receivable.\nWe limit credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and derivative\ninstruments, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions\nwho are the counter-parties to such\nfinancial instruments.\nAs a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and\nutilizing numerous investment grade counter-parties.\nWith respect to our trade receivables, credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively large customer base\nand its\ndispersion across different types of health care professionals and geographic areas.\nNo single customer accounted\nfor more than\n2\n% of our net sales in either of the years ended December 30, 2023\nor December 31, 2022.\nWith\nrespect to our sources of supply, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier\naccounted for approximately\n24\n% and\n4\n%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases for the year ended December\n30, 2023 and approximately\n28\n% and\n4\n%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases for the year ended December\n31, 2022.\nOur long-term notes receivable primarily represent strategic financing arrangements\nwith certain affiliates.\nGenerally, these notes are secured by certain assets of the counterparty; however, in most cases our security is\nsubordinate to the rights of other commercial financial institutions.\nWhile we have exposure to credit loss in the\nevent of non-performance by these counter-parties, we conduct ongoing\nassessments of their financial and\noperational performance.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n101\nNote 12 – Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to market risks and changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and each\nother, and changes to the credit risk of the derivative counterparties.\nWe attempt to minimize these risks using\nforeign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counter-party credit limits.\nOur hedging activities provide\nonly limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks.\nFactors that could influence the effectiveness of\nour hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging\ninstruments and liquidity of the credit\nmarkets.\nAll foreign currency forward contracts that we enter are for the sole\npurpose of hedging an existing or\nanticipated currency exposure.\nWe do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative purposes\nand we manage our credit risks by diversifying our counterparties,\nmaintaining a strong balance sheet and having\nmultiple sources of capital.\nOur derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency forward contracts,\ntotal\nreturn swaps, and interest rate swaps.\nDuring 2019 we entered foreign currency forward contracts that we\ndesignated as net investment hedges to hedge a\nportion of our euro-denominated foreign operations.\nThese net investment hedges offset changes in the U.S. dollar\nvalue of our investments in certain euro-functional currency subsidiaries due\nto fluctuating foreign exchange rates.\nGains and losses related to these net investment hedges are recorded\nin accumulated other comprehensive loss\nwithin our consolidated balance sheets.\nAmounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\nincluded\nin interest expense within our consolidated statements of income.\nThe aggregate notional value of these net\ninvestment hedges, which matured on\nNovember 16, 2023\n, was approximately €\n200\nmillion.\nOn November 3,\n2023 we entered into new foreign currency forward contracts to\nhedge a portion of our euro-denominated foreign\noperations which are designated as net investment hedges.\nThe aggregate notional value of these net investment\nhedges, which matured on\nNovember 16, 2023\n, was approximately €\n200\nmillion.\nThe aggregate notional value of\nthis net investment hedge, which matures on\nNovember 3, 2028\n, is approximately €\n300\nmillion.\nDuring the years\nended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021,\nwe recorded an increase/(decrease) of\n$\n(\n32\n)\nmillion, $\n9\nmillion, and $\n11\nmillion, respectively, within other comprehensive income related to these foreign\ncurrency forward contracts.\nSee\nfor additional information.\nOn\nMarch 20, 2020\n, we entered a total return swap to economically hedge our unfunded\nnon-qualified SERP and\nour DCP.\nThis swap will offset changes in our SERP and DCP liabilities.\nAt the swap’s inception, the notional\nvalue of the investments in these plans was $\n43\nmillion.\nAt December 30, 2023, the notional value of the\ninvestments in these plans was $\n96\nmillion.\nAt December 30, 2023, the financing blended rate for\nthis swap was\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) of\n5.33\n% plus\n0.52\n%, for a combined rate of\n5.85\n%.\nFor\nthe years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022,\nand

respectively, net of transaction costs, related to this undesignated swap.\nSee\nfor additional information.\nOn July 11, 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flow of our variable\nrate $\n750\nmillion floating debt term loan facility, with\nthree years\nmaturity, effectively changing the floating rate portion of\nour obligation to a fixed rate.\nUnder the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we receive variable\ninterest\npayments based on the one-month Term SOFR rate and pay interest at a fixed rate.\nAs of December 30, 2023, the\nnotional value of the interest rate swap agreements was $\n741\nmillion.\nFor the year ended December 30, 2023, we\nrecorded, within accumulated other comprehensive loss within our consolidated\nbalance sheets, a loss of $\n10\nmillion related to the change in the fair value of these interest rate\nswap agreements, since we have designated these\nswaps agreements as cash flow hedges.\nFluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies as compared\nto the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively\naffect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and retained earnings, all of which are expressed\nin U.S.\ndollars.\nWhere we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily\nforeign currency forward\ncontracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange\nrate fluctuations on earnings.\nWe purchase\nshort-term (i.e., generally 18 months or less) foreign currency forward contracts\nto protect against currency\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO

effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate primarily\nrelates to\nstate and foreign income taxes and interest expense.\nIn 2022, the difference between our effective tax rate and the\nfederal statutory tax rate was primarily due to state and foreign income\ntaxes and interest expense.\nIn 2021, our\neffective tax rate was\n23.8\n%, the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate was\nprimarily due to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which requires U.S. companies to\npay a mandatory one-time transition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not\nbeen repatriated to the U.S.\nThe transition tax is payable over eight years.\nWithin our consolidated balance sheets, transition tax of $\n11\nmillion\nand $\n19\nmillion were included in “accrued taxes” for 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $\n24\nmillion and $\n23\nmillion\nwere included in “other liabilities” for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDue to the one-time transition tax and the imposition of the GILTI provisions, all previously unremitted earnings\nwill no longer be subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, there could be U.S., state and/or foreign withholding\ntaxes upon distribution of such unremitted earnings.\nDetermination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax\nliability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.\nThe Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) issued\ntechnical and administrative\nguidance on Pillar Two Model Rules in December 2021, which provides for a global minimum tax rate on the\nearnings of large multinational businesses, on a country-by-country basis.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the minimum\nglobal tax rate is 15% for various jurisdictions pursuant to the Pillar Two framework.\nFuture tax reform resulting\nfrom these developments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles,\nwhich may adversely impact our\neffective tax rate going forward or result in higher cash tax liabilities.\nAs we operate in jurisdictions which have\nadopted Pillar 2, we are continuing to analyze the implications to effectively manage\nthe impact for 2024 and\nbeyond.\nASC Topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with other\nprovisions contained within its guidance.\nThis topic prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement\nattribute\nfor the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or\nexpected to be taken in a tax\nreturn.\nFor those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be\nmore likely than not to be sustained upon\nexamination by the taxing authorities.\nThe amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has\na greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement.\nIn the normal course of business,\nHENRY

expand the market for such drugs and\ntheir own market share and that the entities\nin the supply chain (including Henry Schein, Inc. and its subsidiaries) reaped\nfinancial rewards by refusing or\notherwise failing to monitor appropriately and restrict the improper distribution\nof those drugs.\nThese actions\nconsist of some that have been consolidated within the MultiDistrict

with\nfour\n-year cliff vesting and/or (ii)\nbased on achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time, primarily\nwith\nthree\n-year cliff vesting.\nRSUs granted to our non-employee directors primarily include\n12\n-month cliff vesting.\nFor these RSUs, we recognize the cost as compensation expense on a straight-line\nbasis.\nFor all RSUs, we estimate

method.\nWe estimate grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, we did\nno\nt grant any stock options.\nIn addition to equity-based awards granted in fiscal 2021 under the long-term\nincentive program, the Compensation\nCommittee granted a Special Pandemic Recognition Award under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan to recipients of\nperformance-based RSUs under the 2018 long-term incentive program.\nThe payout under the performance-based\nrestricted stock units granted under the fiscal 2018 long-term incentive program\n(the “2018 LTIP”) was negatively\nimpacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nGiven the significance of the impact of the pandemic on our\nthree\n-\nyear EPS goal under such equity awards and the contributions made by our\nemployees (including those who\nreceived such awards), on March 3, 2021, the Compensation Committee granted\na Special Pandemic Recognition\nAward to recipients of performance-based restricted stock units under the 2018 LTIP who were employed by us on\nthe grant date of the Special Pandemic Recognition Award.\nThese time-based RSU awards vested\n50\n% on the first\nanniversary of the grant date and\n50\n% on the second anniversary of the grant date, based on the recipient’s\ncontinued service and subject to the terms and conditions of the 2020 Stock Incentive\nPlan, and were recorded as\ncompensation expense using a graded vesting method.\nThe combination of the\n20\n% payout based on actual\nperformance of the 2018 LTIP and the one-time Special Pandemic Recognition Award granted in 2021 generated a\ncumulative payout of\n75\n% of each recipient’s original number of performance-based restricted stock units awarded\nin 2018 if the recipient satisfied the\ntwo\n-year vesting schedule commencing on the grant date.\nOur consolidated statements of income reflect pre-tax share-based compensation\nexpense of $\n39\nmillion, $\n54\nmillion and $\n78\nmillion for the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022\nand December 25, 2021.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards as of December 30, 2023 was $\n65\nmillion, which\nis expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately\n2.6\nyears.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-based awards granted\nwas $\n76.43\n, $\n85.51\nand $\n62.72\nper share\nduring the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December\n25, 2021.\nCertain stock-based compensation is required to be settled in cash.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, we\nrecorded a liability of $\n0.1\nmillion for stock-based compensation to be settled in cash.\nWe\nrecord deferred income tax assets for awards that will result in\nfuture income tax deductions based on the\namount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate in the\njurisdiction in which we will receive a\ndeduction.\nOur consolidated statements of cash flows present our stock-based compensation\nexpense as a reconciling\nadjustment between net income and net cash provided by operating\nactivities for all periods presented.\nThere were\nno cash benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized\ncompensation for the years ended\nDecember 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021.\nHENRY

be disclosed by us in reports that we file\nor submit under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure and\nthat

Biotech Dental, and S.I.N., which together represent\nless than 1.5% of our total net sales, from our\nannual assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December\n30, 2023, as permitted by SEC staff\ninterpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses.\nPost-acquisition integration related activities for other dental and\nmedical businesses acquired during 2023 across\nthe U.S., Europe, Brazil, Australia, and China were included in\nour annual assessment of internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 30, 2023.\nThese acquisitions, the majority of which utilize separate information\nand financial accounting systems, have been included in our consolidated financial\nstatements since their respective\ndates of acquisition.\nFinally, we continued systems implementation activities in the U.S. for two of our dental businesses.\nThe combination of acquisitions (including Shield, S.I.N., and Biotech\nDental), continued acquisition integrations\nand systems implementation activities undertaken during the quarter\nand carried over from prior quarters when\nconsidered in the aggregate, represents a material change in our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nDuring the quarter, all acquisitions, continued acquisition integrations and systems implementation activities\ninvolve necessary and appropriate change-management controls\nthat are considered in our quarterly assessment of\nchanges in our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn October 2023, we experienced a cybersecurity incident that primarily\naffected the operations of our North\nAmerican and European dental and medical distribution businesses.\nOnce we became aware of the issue, as part of\nthe Company’s incident response plan, we took precautionary actions to contain the incident including shutting\ndown connectivity to networks and key business, operating and financial\naccounting systems globally.\nIn addition\nto notifying affected and potentially affected third parties and all relevant law enforcement\nauthorities, we engaged\nexternal cyber-security experts to support our assessment of the cyber-incident’s impact as well as sanitize, rebuild\nand restore our affected systems and applications.\nWe also notified law enforcement and our employees,\ncustomers, suppliers and investors, informing them of both the incident and\nmanagement’s efforts to mitigate its\nimpact on our daily operations and data maintained on the Company’s systems.\n127\nSubsequently, on or about November 8, 2023, we determined that the threat actor obtained personal and sensitive\ninformation maintained on our systems belonging to certain third parties and\nsince that date we have notified\naffected parties and potentially affected parties as appropriate.\nThe scope of personal and sensitive data impacted is\nstill under investigation.\nOn November 22, 2023, we experienced a related disruption to our\necommerce platform and related applications,\nwhich has since been remediated.\nIn order to mitigate the impact of this disruption on our systems and on our\nability to service customers, alternative\nprocedures and controls were temporarily implemented.\nManagement’s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate\ninternal control over financial reporting,\nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).\nOur internal control system is designed to provide\nreasonable assurance to our management and Board regarding the preparation\nand fair presentation of published\nfinancial statements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management,\nincluding our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated\nFramework (2013), updated\nand reissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, or the COSO Framework.\nBased on our evaluation\nunder the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our\ninternal control over financial reporting was\neffective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 30, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30,\n2023, has been independently\naudited by BDO USA, P.C., an independent registered public accounting firm, and their attestation is included\nherein. The evaluation of internal controls involves judgment.\nOur external auditor has concluded that the\nCompany has a material weakness resulting from the aggregation of certain\ncontrol deficiencies at the application\ncontrol level related to logical and user access management and segregation of\nduties.\nThe Company agrees that\nthere are control deficiencies that our external auditor has identified, all of which\neither have been addressed or are\nbeing addressed. The Company’s management has considered the control deficiencies identified by our\nexternal\nauditor, and believes that, individually and in aggregate, they do not result in a material weakness.\nA material\nweakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such\nthat\nthere is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the\ncompany’s financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis.\nLimitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide\nonly reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the internal control system are met.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of any internal control\nsystem, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that\nall control issues, if any, within a company\nhave been detected.\n128\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nHenry Schein, Inc.\nMelville, NY\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe\nhave audited Henry\nSchein, Inc.’s\n(the “Company’s”)\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as\nof December\n30, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the\n“COSO criteria”).
