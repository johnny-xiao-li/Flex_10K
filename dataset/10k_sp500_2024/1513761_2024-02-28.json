    "text": "History and Development of the Company\nNorwegian commenced operations from Miami, Florida in 1966, launching the modern cruise industry by offering weekly departures from Miami, Florida to destinations in the Caribbean. In February 2011, NCLH, a Bermuda limited company, was formed. In January 2013, NCLH completed its IPO and the ordinary shares of NCLC were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH, and NCLH became the owner of 100% of the ordinary shares and parent company of NCLC. In November 2014, we completed the Acquisition of Prestige.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, in response to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”)’s BEPS 2.0 Pillar 2 global tax reform, the Company restructured its organizational structure by realigning many of its operations across its three different brands into a single jurisdiction, Bermuda.  In connection with the reorganization, among other steps, certain NCLH subsidiaries previously domiciled in the Isle of Man, the Cayman Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Panama and the state of Delaware, were redomiciled to Bermuda.\nOur Company\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands.\nOur brands offer itineraries to worldwide destinations including Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa, Canada, Bermuda, Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii. Norwegian’s U.S.-flagged ship, Pride of America, provides the industry’s only entirely inter-island itinerary in Hawaii.\nAll of our brands offer an assortment of features, amenities and activities, including a variety of accommodations, multiple dining venues, bars and lounges, spa, casino and retail shopping areas and numerous entertainment choices. All brands also offer a selection of shore excursions at each port of call as well as hotel packages for stays before or after a voyage.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 32 ships with approximately 66,500 Berths. During 2023, we took delivery of three ships. In April 2023 we took delivery of Oceania Cruises’ Vista, in August 2023 we took delivery of Norwegian Viva, and in November 2023 we took delivery of Seven Seas Grandeur. We have orders for five additional ships to be delivered. For the Norwegian brand, we have four Prima Class Ships on order, with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028. For Oceania Cruises, we have one Allura Class Ship on order for delivery in 2025. These additions to our fleet are expected to increase our total Berths to approximately 82,500.\nCorporate Information\nOur registered offices are located at Walkers Corporate (Bermuda) Limited, Park Place, 55 Par-la-Ville Road, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. Our principal executive offices are located at 7665 Corporate Center Drive, Miami, Florida 33126. Daniel S. Farkas, the Company’s Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Development Officer and Assistant Secretary, is our agent for service of process at our principal executive offices.\n​\n9\nNear-Term Priorities\nCapitalize on healthy demand environment\n​\nIn 2023, we took delivery of three ships and absorbed the corresponding new capacity. We managed to maintain an optimal 12-month forward booked position while also increasing pricing. Additionally, we focused on maximizing onboard revenue generation by implementing bundling strategies to increase revenue generation prior to sailing. These efforts allowed us to leverage the healthy demand environment and drive overall profitability, and we expect to continue to take advantage of these market conditions in 2024.\n​\nRight-size cost base\n​\nWe are currently undergoing a broad and ongoing effort to improve operating efficiencies, including cost minimization initiatives, to strengthen the foundation for sustained, profitable growth and mitigate the impact of inflation and supply chain disruptions. We have various planned initiatives both shoreside and shipboard, either already implemented or in process, which we expect will contribute to this broader efficiency improvement effort while continuing to provide value to our guests.\n​\nStrategic enhancements to guest experience\n​\nWe are continually working on enhancements aimed at maximizing guest satisfaction and with a focus on efficient investments that prioritize returns. For example, in 2023 we announced that we would improve the connectivity for guests and crew at sea by offering Space X’s Starlink high-speed internet on our ships, which is expected to be completed for the entire fleet in 2024. By identifying and implementing these enhancements, we aim to provide an exceptional guest experience and further strengthen our market position.\n​\nChart path to reduce leverage and lower the balance sheet risk\nIn 2023, we continued to take actions to bolster our financial condition as part of our long-term post-pandemic financial recovery strategy.\nRefer to Note 8 – “Long-Term Debt” for further details about the above transactions.\n10\nOur Fleet\n​\nThe following table presents information about our ships and their primary areas of operation based on current and future itineraries, which are subject to change.\n​\n11\n​\nOur Mission, Competitive Strengths & Business Strategies\nOur core mission is to provide exceptional vacation experiences delivered by passionate team members committed to world-class hospitality and innovation. We believe that the following business strengths support our overall strategy to deliver on our mission.\n​\nEnhanced Product Offering and Guest Experience\n​\nOur portfolio of three award-winning brands operates a combined 32 ships ranging in size from approximately 500 to over 4,000 Berths.  Along with introducing new vessels to the fleet, we continually invest in revitalizations to existing ships to provide new and enhanced offerings that we believe deliver higher guest satisfaction and, in turn, higher pricing.\nNorwegian’s ships cater to a variety of travelers with up to 20 dining options; various attractions, including the world’s only racetracks at sea; a wide array of entertainment options; full-service spas at sea; and a diverse range of accommodations including luxury suites in The Haven, studio staterooms designed and priced for the solo traveler and everything in between. Oceania Cruises’ award-winning onboard dining, with multiple open seating dining venues, is a central highlight of its cruise experience. Regent’s all-inclusive offering includes business class air on intercontinental flights, unlimited shore excursions, one-night pre-cruise hotel package in Concierge Suites and higher, specialty restaurants, unlimited beverages, including fine wines and spirits, pre-paid gratuities, unlimited Wi-Fi, transfers between airport and ship, valet laundry service and other amenities.\n​\nThe Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent brands all offer a high level of onboard service. The organizational structure of our operations promotes collaboration amongst our brands to exchange best practices that ultimately provide an enhanced guest experience. Norwegian offers guests high quality service and the freedom and flexibility to design their ideal cruise vacation on their schedule with no set dining times, a variety of activity options and no formal dress codes. Oceania Cruises and Regent are known for their high level of service, including some of the highest crew-to-guest ratios in the industry with trained staff providing personalized service and world class cuisine.\nRich Stateroom Mix\nThe Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent fleets offer an attractive mix of staterooms, suites and villas. Norwegian offers a variety of accommodations to meet the needs of all types of travelers, from inside, oceanview, balcony and connecting staterooms.  For guests looking to spread out, Norwegian delivers a range of suites, from two-bedroom family suites to penthouses and owner suites, as well as three-bedroom Garden Villas measuring up to 6,694 square feet. In addition, 13 of Norwegian’s ships offer The Haven, a key-card access enclave on the upper decks with luxurious suite accommodations, exclusive amenities, and 24/7 butler and concierge service. The Haven guests also enjoy exclusive access to a dedicated pool, hot tubs, sundeck, fine-dining restaurant, bar lounge and other amenities. The Haven\n12\nexperience is available on Norwegian Epic, and the vessels of the Jewel, Breakaway, Breakaway Plus and Prima Class Ships. Norwegian’s accommodations also include studio staterooms designed for solo travelers centered around a key-card access only Studio Lounge where single travelers can interact.  Recently, Norwegian expanded its solo stateroom offerings across its entire fleet, offering more variety of staterooms priced for the solo traveler.\nThe spacious and elegant accommodations on Oceania Cruises’ seven award-winning ships range from 143-square foot inside staterooms to opulent 2,400-square foot Owner Suites. The Regent fleet is comprised of six ships. Seven Seas Voyager, Mariner, Explorer, Splendor and Grandeur feature all-suite, all-balcony accommodations, and a majority of the accommodations on Seven Seas Navigator include balconies. The three newest ships in the Regent fleet, Seven Seas Grandeur, Splendor and Explorer, also feature the Regent Suite, a 4,443 square-foot luxurious suite accommodation that includes an in-suite spa retreat, a 1,300 square-foot wraparound veranda, and a glass-enclosed solarium sitting area.\n​\nItinerary Optimization & Premium Itinerary Mix\n​\nWe manage our ships’ deployments to promote a better breadth of itineraries, sell cruises further in advance and maximize profitability while also considering our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We offer a diverse selection of premium itineraries with worldwide deployment and voyages ranging from three days to a 180-day around-the-world cruise. Our vessels call on ports including Scandinavia, Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada and New England, Hawaii, Asia, Tahiti and the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, India, South America, the Panama Canal and the Caribbean.  Our destination management team reviews deployments across the fleet, either repositioning ships to new destinations or fine-tuning itineraries, with the goal of diversifying our deployment and creating product scarcity which, in turn, leads to higher pricing.\n​\nWe are also focused on destination development and have created two private destinations to enhance the shore experience for our guests. We were the first cruise line to develop a private island, Great Stirrup Cay in The Bahamas. This private island features over 1,500 feet of accessible beachfront with white sand beaches; over 50 cabana and villa options; an array of shore excursions including a new over water zipline experience that extends nearly 3,000 feet in length; and on-island food and beverage offerings. In 2019, we launched Silver Cove, the latest enhancement designed to elevate the guest experience on Great Stirrup Cay. This exclusive oceanfront lagoon area includes private beachfront villas, a Mandara Spa with beachfront treatments as well as the exclusive Moët & Chandon Bar and upscale Silver Cove Restaurant and Bar. The 38 luxury air-conditioned villas range from studios to larger one-and-two-bedroom villas, all of which include a private bathroom, daybed, club chairs, televisions with on-demand entertainment, outdoor patio and lounge seating, retractable glass walls providing unobstructed views and access to the private beachfront lagoon. In 2016, we introduced Harvest Caye, the Company’s private resort-style destination in Southern Belize.  The 75-acre destination features Belize’s only cruise ship pier, an expansive seven-acre white sand beach, 15,000 sq. ft. pool with swim up bar, multiple dining options and a nature center with wildlife experiences plus adventure tours.\n​\nDisciplined Fleet Expansion\nFor the Norwegian brand, we have four Prima Class Ships on order with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028. The third and fourth Prima Class Ships will be approximately 156,300 Gross Tons with 3,550 Berths and the fifth and sixth Prima Class Ships will be approximately 169,000 Gross Tons with 3,850 Berths. For the Oceania Cruises brand, we have an order for one Allura Class Ship to be delivered in 2025, which will be approximately 67,800 Gross Tons and 1,250 Berths. The impacts of initiatives to improve environmental sustainability, modifications the Company has made to its newbuilds and/or other macroeconomic conditions and events have resulted in delays in expected ship deliveries in the past. These and other impacts could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future, which may be prolonged.\nWe believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands, position us for accelerated growth and provide an optimized return on invested capital. We have obtained fixed-rate export-credit backed financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship currently scheduled to be delivered through 2028, subject to certain conditions.\n​\n13\nRevenue Management and Promotional Construct Strategy\n​\nOur revenue management function performs extensive analyses in order to determine booking history and uses trends by itinerary, sailing, stateroom category, distribution channel and market segment to optimize cruise ticket revenue. Our revenue management strategies result in a longer booking window with enhanced predictability and the opportunity to increase prices through the booking curve.\nOur promotional construct revolves around a value-add bundled product for all three brands which we believe leads to higher quality guest bookings. The Norwegian brand’s Free at Sea program offers guests the choice of a more inclusive, value-add experience that includes multiple amenities to customize their cruise experience, while driving higher pricing and enhanced guest satisfaction. Oceania Cruises’ simply MORE™ program offers a range of included amenities which can include roundtrip airfare, airport transfers and shore excursions.  Regent offers an inclusive luxury experience with unlimited shore excursions and one-night pre-cruise hotel stay among other offerings.\nThese strategies are designed to maximize revenue while providing value to our guests. We believe these strategies and other initiatives executed through our distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in revenues achieved.\nMarketing Strategy\nOur marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and consideration of our products and services among consumers and travel partners with the ultimate goal of driving sales. We utilize a multi-channel marketing strategy that may include a combination of print, television, radio, digital, website/e-commerce, direct mail, social media and influencer marketing, mobile and e-mail campaigns, partnerships, customer loyalty initiatives, market research, public relations, consumer events and business-to-business events. We continue to test, enhance and expand our use of digital marketing, data and analytics and emerging marketing technology to drive cost efficiencies and maximize return.\nBuilding customer loyalty among our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy. Past guests create a cost-effective means of attracting business, particularly to our new ships and itineraries as they are familiar with our brands, products and services and often return to cruise with us. We will continue to optimize our customer databases and target marketing capabilities to further enhance our communications with our past guests who receive e-mail, direct mail and brochures with informative destination and product information and promotional amenities. Our marketing mix includes a balance of initiatives that both allow us to build our brand awareness to attract new-to-brand customers, while also focusing on more targeted marketing communications aimed at retaining our current loyal repeat guest base.\nContinued investments in our websites and applications will be key not only to driving interest and bookings, but also to ensuring the optimal pre-cruise planning experience offering guests the ability to shop, reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services. We have a strong communications stream that provides customized pre-cruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications to welcome them home post cruise to engage them in booking their next cruise vacation with us.\nTravel advisors are crucial to our marketing and distribution efforts. We provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel advisor partners through a variety of programs. Our travel partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our products and experiences, itineraries and other best-selling practices. Advisors can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials for their use in promoting and marketing our products through our online platforms.\nGuest feedback is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies. We regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs and/or to solicit information that helps shape future direction of the experiences we provide.\nExpand and Strengthen Our Product Distribution Channels\nAs part of our growth strategy, we continually look for ways to deepen and expand our sales channels.\n14\nWe have strategic relationships with travel advisors and tour operators who recognize our brands as preferred partners and dedicate resources to sell our inventory with long lead times at the highest possible prices. The retail/travel advisor channel represents a significant portion of our ticket sales. Our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of independent travel advisors worldwide. We have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies, transparent pricing strategies, effective marketing tools, improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives to enhance and facilitate the ability of travel advisors to market and sell our products. We have sales teams who work closely with our travel advisor partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness across all three of our brands. Our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer through product and sales training. This education process creates a deeper understanding of all our product offerings.\n​\nWe have invested in our brands by enhancing websites, mobile applications and passenger services departments including our personal cruise consultants, who offer personalized service throughout the process of designing cruise vacations for our guests. We have also enhanced our capabilities to enable guests to customize their vacation experience with certain onboard product offerings. We also utilize our onboard cruise sales channel where guests can book their next cruise or purchase cruise certificates to apply to their next cruise while vacationing on our ships.\nOur meetings, incentives and charters channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel. These sales often have very long lead times and can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity, or even an entire sailing, in one transaction. Sixthman, a subsidiary company specializing in developing and delivering music and overall festival-focused charters, provides a market to sell high-quality music and festival-at-sea experiences to guests. To further grow and expand this channel, we introduced a new branded initiative “Experiences at Sea,” consisting of Sixthman and the Company’s Charters, Meetings & Incentives department. Experiences at Sea focuses on corporate, incentive and affinity-focused clients across all three of our brands.\nCasino Player Strategy\nWe have non-exclusive arrangements with casino partners worldwide whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable for cruises. Through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs, we have the opportunity to market cruises to these guests. These arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests expected to generate above-average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending.\nStrengthening Our Global Footprint\nOur international efforts are aimed at strengthening our global footprint by increasing brand awareness across the globe which allows us to diversify our guest sourcing.  We maintain numerous sales offices which support sales and marketing efforts in various markets outside of North America including the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, Australia and Brazil.\nOur Commitment to Sustainability\n​\nThe continued success of our business is linked to our ability to operate and grow sustainably. We are committed to driving a positive impact on society and the environment through our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain. The Sail & Sustain program is centered around five pillars: Reducing Environmental Impact, Sailing Safely, Empowering People, Strengthening Our Communities and Operating with Integrity and Accountability. The Company’s Board of Directors is actively engaged in overseeing the Sail & Sustain program and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) strategy and implementation through its Technology, Environmental, Safety & Security Committee.\n​\nReducing our environmental impact is a key component of the Sail & Sustain program. All of our ships have environmental management systems that are certified under the International Organization for Standardization’s 14001 Standard. This voluntary standard sets requirements for the establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system.\n​\n15\nAs part of our environmental commitment, we are pursuing net zero greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 2050 across our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) and value chain (Scope 3). We have set interim targets to guide us on our path to net zero and provide more details about them in our annual ESG Report.\n​\nThe three components of our climate action strategy are Efficiency, Innovation and Collaboration. Each ship in our fleet has a Shipboard Energy Efficiency Management Plan with the objective to improve the overall operating efficiency of the ship by implementing methods for energy and fuel savings. We evaluate, monitor, and implement energy-savings projects on our existing ships including but not limited to HVAC system upgrades, LED lighting, hydrodynamic upgrades, and Waste Heat Recovery projects.\n​\nThe path towards net zero is complex, and this effort will require significant technology advancements including commercially viable and scalable low or zero GHG emission fuels, but we are committed to doing our part to facilitate this transition. For example, we have successfully tested the use of biofuel blends on over 20% of our fleet as a potential “drop-in” solution that does not require modifications to existing engines. We are also investing in shore power technology, which with the appropriate port infrastructure would allow us to connect to onshore electrical power grids to supply much of the power needed while docked. A total of 16 ships in our fleet, or 50%, are currently equipped with shore power technology, and we are targeting approximately 70% of our fleet to be equipped by year-end 2025. To prepare for a long-term transition towards net zero, we have lengthened and reconfigured the designs for the final two Prima Class ships, expected to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, to accommodate the use of green methanol as a future fuel source. While additional modifications will be needed to fully enable the use of green methanol, these modifications represent an important step forward in the pursuit of net zero by 2050.\n​\nWe also drive social impact through our philanthropy initiatives, partnerships and community engagement programs. As a travel company, our success is dependent on the wellbeing and vibrancy of the destinations we visit across the globe. We strive to be a great partner to each destination we visit, working together to find sustainable, long-term solutions for the communities, while at the same time allowing our guests to experience all that these incredible destinations have to offer.\n​\nWe provide regular updates to our stakeholders on our sustainability efforts and promote awareness on important topics through our Sail & Sustain program, our annual ESG report and through various communications regarding important sustainability initiatives across distribution channels including but not limited to press releases, social media and our corporate website. We have published disclosures aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework as well as the recommendations outlined in the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework to provide additional transparency to our stakeholders. Climate-related risks, greenhouse gas information and details of our climate action strategy are disclosed in our annual ESG report and annual submission to CDP, which can be found on our website. For additional information regarding our sustainability initiatives, please visit our website at www.nclhltd.com.\n​\nHighly Experienced Management Team\n​\nOur senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive experience in the cruise, travel, leisure and hospitality-related industries. See “Information about our Executive Officers” below for more information on our highly experienced management team.\n​\nPassenger Ticket Revenue\n​\nWe offer our guests a wide variety of options when booking a cruise. Our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and an array of onboard activities and amenities, meals, entertainment and government taxes, fees and port expenses. In some instances, cruise ticket prices include round-trip airfare to and from the port of embarkation, complimentary beverages, unlimited shore excursions, internet, valet laundry services, pre-cruise hotel packages, as well as pre- or post-cruise land packages at many destinations we sail to around the world. Prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary, voyage length, stateroom category selected, added inclusions and the time of year that the sailing takes place.\n​\n16\nOnboard and Other Revenue\nAll three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare, including casino operations, certain food and beverage, shore excursions, gift shop purchases, spa services, Wi-Fi services and other similar items. Food and beverage, casino operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops, spa services, art auctions and internet services may be managed through contracts with third-party concessionaires. These contracts generally entitle us to a percentage of the gross sales derived from these concessions. Norwegian’s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations, meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment, pool-side activities and various sports programs. To maximize onboard revenue, all three brands use various cross-marketing and promotional tools which are supported by point-of-sale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and services. Oceania Cruises’ ticket prices may include air transportation and certain other amenities. Regent’s ticket prices typically include air transportation, unlimited shore excursions, a pre-cruise hotel night stay (for concierge level and above), premium wines and liquors, specialty restaurants, Wi-Fi, valet laundry and gratuities.\nSeasonality\nOur operations are seasonal and results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year. Historically, demand for cruises has been strongest during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months, which has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during non-peak demand periods.\nCompetition\nOur primary competition includes operators such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean as well as other cruise lines such as MSC Cruises, Viking Ocean Cruises and Virgin Voyages. In addition, we compete with land-based vacation alternatives, such as hotels and resorts, vacation ownership properties, casinos, and tourist destinations throughout the world.\nShip Operations and Cruise Infrastructure\nShip Maintenance and Logistics\nSophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical capabilities and modern look of our fleet. In addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements, each of our ships is generally taken out of service, approximately every 24 to 60 months, for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work, repairs and improvements performed in Dry-dock. Dry-dock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under IMO requirements reflected in chapters of the International Convention of the Safety of Life at Seas (“SOLAS”) and to some extent the International Load Lines Convention. Under these regulations, it is required that a passenger ship Dry-dock once in five years (depending on age of vessel) or twice in five years (depending on flag state and age of vessel) and the maximum interval between each Dry-dock cannot exceed three years (depending on flag state and age of vessel). However, most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by The Bahamas and/or Marshall Islands (flag state), as applicable, after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to Dry-dock once every five years. To the extent practical, each ship’s crew, catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the Dry-dock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work. Accordingly, Dry-dock work is typically performed during non-peak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service. Dry-docks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability. We typically take this opportunity to upgrade the vessels in all areas of both guest-facing services and innovative compliance technology.\nSuppliers\nOur largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition. Our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related (including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services), fuel, airfare, food and\n17\nbeverage, advertising and marketing and travel advisor services. Most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices. In addition, due to the large quantities that we purchase, we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies. Our purchases for ship construction expenditures are generally denominated in euros and other purchases are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. Payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry.\nCrew and Staff\nBest-in-class guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate, where travelers have discerning tastes and high expectations for quality service. We have dedicated resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests. Among other initiatives, we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs, with a focus on career development. We believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew, helping to build customer loyalty.\nWe place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests, crew and the communities we visit. We operate all our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of SOLAS and International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”), the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry. Crew members are trained in the Company’s stringent safety protocols, participating in regular safety trainings, exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships to familiarize themselves and become proficient with the safety equipment onboard. In order to expand our public health protocols, we have developed Infectious Disease Management Protocols that our crew members are trained on prior to returning to service. These policies and protocols were certified and audited to DNV’s Certification in Infection Prevention which further enhances our outbreak prevention and response to all types of infectious disease including, but not limited to COVID-19, norovirus, acute gastroenteritis, influenza and influenza-like illnesses.\n​\nAdditional support to the above is provided to crew members with the NCLH Wellness at Sea initiative to create a wellness-conscious work environment on the vessels. We are committed to providing crew members with guidelines, resources, and activities for educational purposes and to guide them to achieve optimal wellness. Topics in this initiative address nutrition, physical activity, sleep and stress management and alcohol and tobacco awareness to name a few.\n​\nOur captains and chief engineers are experienced seafarers. Our bridge and technical officers regularly undergo rigorous operations training such as leadership, navigation, stability, statutory and environmental regulatory compliance. To support our deck and engine officers while at sea, we have bridge and engine protocols and support documentation in place, dictating specific standard operating procedures. Our bridge teams conduct a voyage planning process prior to sailing, where the upcoming itinerary is reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to departure and in preparation for arrival. In addition, all of our ships employ state-of-the-art navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have accurate data regarding the planned itinerary.\nPrior to every cruise setting sail, we show a safety video, which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions, and familiarize guests with their muster stations and important safety information. Our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems. We have developed a Safety Management System (“SMS”), which establishes policies, procedures, training, qualification, quality, compliance, audit and self-improvement standards. SMS also provides real-time reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions. Through these systems, our senior managers, as well as ship management, can focus on consistent, high-quality operation of the fleet. Our SMS is approved and audited regularly by our classification society, Lloyds Register, and it also undergoes regular internal audits as well as periodic inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard, flag state and other port and state authorities.\nInsurance\nWe maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship. The coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the European and U.S. insurance markets.\n18\nIn addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships, we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business. The insurance we carry includes:\nOur insurance coverage, including those noted above, is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels.\nTrademarks and Trade Names\nUnder the Norwegian brand, we own a number of registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE” and “FEEL FREE,” the names of our ships (except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending), incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “THE HAVEN BY NORWEGIAN.” In addition, we own registered trademarks relating to the “FREESTYLE” family of names, including, “FREESTYLE CRUISING,” “FREESTYLE DINING” and “FREESTYLE VACATION.” We believe that these trademarks are widely recognized throughout North America, Europe and other areas of the world and have considerable value.\nUnder the Oceania Cruises brand, we own a number of registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “OCEANIA CRUISES” and its logo, “REGATTA,” “INSIGNIA,” and “YOUR WORLD. YOUR WAY.”\nUnder the Regent brand, we own registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “SEVEN SEAS CRUISES” and “AN UNRIVALED EXPERIENCE” as well as the names of our ships (except where trademark applications have been filed and are pending).\nWe also claim common law rights in trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with our ships, incentive programs, customer loyalty program and specialty services rendered onboard our ships for each of our brands.\nThe Regent ships have been operating under the Regent brand since 2006. We entered into a trademark license agreement with Regent Hospitality Worldwide, Inc., which we amended in February 2011, granting us the right to use the “Regent” brand family of marks. The amended trademark license agreement allows Regent to use the Regent trade name, in conjunction with cruises, in perpetuity, subject to the terms and conditions in the agreement.\nRegulatory Matters\nRegistration of Our Ships\nTwenty-one of the ships that we currently operate are registered in The Bahamas. One of our ships, Pride of America, is a U.S.-flagged ship. Ten of our ships are registered in the Marshall Islands. Our ships registered in The Bahamas and the Marshall Islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to Bahamian and Marshall Islands requirements and are subject to International laws and regulations and to various U.S. federal regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Our U.S.-registered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the U.S. federal government, including, but not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Department of Labor. The international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other\n19\nlegal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited.\nOur ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security, environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements.\nEconomic Substance Requirements\nNCLH and NCLC are exempted companies formed under the laws of Bermuda and some of their subsidiaries have been formed or continued in Bermuda, Guernsey, Isle of Man, British Virgin Islands, St. Lucia or The Bahamas. Pursuant to the legislation passed in each jurisdiction, entities subject to each jurisdiction’s laws that carry out relevant activities as specified in such laws, are required to demonstrate adequate economic substance in that jurisdiction.  In general terms, adequate economic substance means: (i) the entity is actually directed and managed in the jurisdiction; (ii)  core income-generating activities relating to the applicable relevant activity are performed in the jurisdiction; (iii) there are adequate employees in the jurisdiction; (iv) the entity maintains adequate physical presence in the jurisdiction; and (v) there is adequate operating expenditure in the jurisdiction. We have evaluated the activities of NCLH, NCLC and their subsidiaries and have concluded that in some cases, those activities are 'relevant activities' for the purposes of the applicable economic substance laws and that, consequently, certain entities within our organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with these economic substance requirements. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to increased costs and our management team may be required to devote significant time to satisfying economic substance requirements in certain of these jurisdictions. If such entities cannot establish compliance with these requirements, we may be liable to pay additional penalties and fines in the applicable jurisdictions and/or required to re-domicile such entities to different jurisdictions. We are taking steps to meet Bermuda Economic Substance requirements and we expect to meet these requirements in 2024.\nEnvironmental Protection\nOur ships are subject to various international, national, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those that govern air emissions, waste discharge, wastewater management and disposal, and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints. Under such laws and regulations, we are prohibited from discharging certain materials, such as petrochemicals and plastics, into waterways, and we must adhere to various water and air quality-related requirements. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”) is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or accidental causes, and currently contains six annexes, four of which are applicable to cruise ships.\nWith regard to air quality requirements, MARPOL Annex VI sets a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 0.5%. Various compliance methods, such as the use of alternative fuels, or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur oxide (“SOx”) emissions may be utilized. Annex VI also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions within designated Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”), which include the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, North American waters and the U.S. Caribbean Sea. Ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1% or use approved alternative emission reduction methods. ECAs have also been established to limit emissions of oxides of nitrogen (“NOx”) from newly built ships with keel lay dates after January 1, 2016. Under MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 14, the Mediterranean Sea will become an ECA with new limits on SOx taking effect on May 1, 2025. Additional ECAs may also be established in the future, with areas around Norway and Japan being considered.\nBallast water discharges are governed by the MARPOL Ballast Water Management Convention, which came into force in 2017 (the “Convention”), and which governs the discharge of ballast water from ships. Ballast water, which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization, may contain a variety of marine species. The Convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new, different, or potentially unsuitable environments. Applicable vessels sailing in specific itineraries have also been upgraded with ballast water treatment systems to further prevent the spread of invasive species.\n20\nMARPOL also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage, oil and sewage from ships, including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges, and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling. Ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land. Governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage, without causing delay to ships. Ships are required to be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants, disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks.\nAmendments to MARPOL have made the Baltic Sea a MARPOL Annex IV “Special Area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships are prohibited unless they comply with Resolution MEPC 227(64) adopted by the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (“MEPC”) of the IMO. Stricter discharge restrictions went into effect for new passenger ships in 2019, and for existing passenger ships in 2021.\nIn the U.S., the Clean Water Act of 1972, and other laws and regulations, provide the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the U.S. Coast Guard with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is in inland waters, within three nautical miles of land, and in designated federally-protected waters. The U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) program, authorized by the Clean Water Act, was established to reduce pollution within U.S. territorial waters. For our affected ships, all of the NPDES requirements are set forth in the EPA’s Vessel General Permit (“VGP”). The VGP establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge streams incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. In addition to these discharge- and vessel-specific requirements, the VGP includes requirements for inspections, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. In 2018, the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), which will eventually replace the VGP, was signed into law, and the EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2020 and a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking in 2023 to establish national standards of performance under VIDA that would apply to 20 different types of vessel equipment and systems, as well as general discharge standards that would apply to all types of vessel incidental discharges within 12 nautical miles of the United States. The VGP has been administratively extended while standards under VIDA are being developed. With certain exceptions, VIDA requires that the new standards be at least as stringent as the VGP requirements. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, which implements certain elements of MARPOL in the U.S., provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to ship-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles of land and, in some cases, within the 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”).\nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200-nautical mile EEZ of the U.S., subject to defined monetary limits. OPA 90 requires that in order for us to operate in U.S. waters, we must have Certificates of Financial Responsibility (“COFR”) from the U.S. Coast Guard for each ship.  Our continued OPA 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related OPA 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance.\nMany coastal U.S. states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law and, in some cases, the laws have no statutory limits of liability. Among the most stringent requirements are those set by the State of Alaska, which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards. The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters.\nThe European Union (“E.U.”) has also adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment. To support the implementation and enforcement of European environmental legislation, the E.U. has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections.\nWith regard to air emissions from seagoing ships, the E.U. requires the use of low sulfur (less than 0.1%) marine gas oil in E.U. ports. All non-ECA waters have a 0.5% fuel sulfur limit.\nThe European Commission has also implemented regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions from maritime shipping through a Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (“MRV”) regulation, which requires ships over 5,000 Gross Tons to\n21\nmonitor and report carbon emissions on all voyages to, from and between E.U. ports as well as ports in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). As of January 1, 2024, the E.U. MRV regulation is requiring carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions to be reported.\nAs part of its Fit for 55 package, the E.U. is in the process of adopting several rules aimed at reducing GHG emissions. Two of the mechanisms that are being used to achieve emissions reductions are the Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) and the FuelEU Maritime Initiative. We expect to have increased costs associated with the Fit for 55 regulations but are not able to quantify the impact yet as the impact will depend on future market pricing. In addition, strategies to reduce GHG emissions as well as ship deployment modifications could mitigate the impact of these regulations.\nThe IMO implemented a variety of measures to support the targets of the initial 2018 GHG strategy. In 2021, the IMO adopted two new requirements, which went into effect in 2023, the Carbon Intensity Indicator (the “CII”) and Energy Efficiency Ship Index (the “EEXI”). The CII is an operational metric designed to measure how efficiently a ship transports goods or passengers by looking at carbon dioxide emissions per nautical mile. Ships are given an annual rating from A to E with a C or better required for compliance. For ships that receive a D rating for three consecutive years, or an E rating for one year, a corrective action plan will need to be developed and approved. Beginning in 2023, ships are now required to reduce carbon intensity by 5% from a 2019 baseline, with 2% incremental improvements each year thereafter until 2030. The enforcement mechanism for CII has not yet been defined. The EEXI is a one-time design re-certification requirement that updates energy efficiency requirements for existing ships and regulates carbon dioxide emissions related to installed engine power, transport capacity and ship speed. Ongoing compliance with the EEXI is not expected to have a material impact on our operations.\nIn 2023, the IMO revised its 2018 GHG strategy with three ambitions: a reduction in carbon intensity of international shipping by at least 40% by 2030, compared to 2008; an uptake of zero or near-zero GHG emission technologies, fuel and/or energy sources to represent at least 5%, striving for 10%, of the energy used by 2030; and, GHG emissions from international shipping to reach net zero by or around 2050. The strategy also set out indicative checkpoints, both relative to 2008, including a reduction of the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 20%, striving for 30%, by 2030, and by at least 70%, striving for 80%, by 2040. The IMO also decided to develop a basket of measures to support the revised ambitions consisting of two parts: a technical element which will be a goal-based marine fuel standard regulating the phased reduction of marine fuel GHG intensity, and an economic element which may be some form of a maritime GHG emissions pricing mechanism. The IMO will continue to develop these measures and according to the agreed timeline, the measures are expected to be adopted in 2025 and enter into force in around mid-2027.\n22\nCompliance with such laws and regulations has resulted in increased costs to our Company and is expected to entail significant expenses for a combination of: ship modifications, purchases of emissions allowances, alternative fuels and higher-cost compliant newbuilds. Compliance is also expected to result in changes to our operating procedures, including limitations on our ability to operate in certain locations and slowing the speed of our ships, and may render some ships obsolete, which would adversely impact our operations. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, areas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. Some environmental groups continue to lobby for more stringent restrictions of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact.\nIf we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws, regulations or treaties, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws, regulations and treaties. Any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flow or financial condition. We expect to make material investments in our business to comply with these laws and regulations; however, the total impact cannot be determined as we are evaluating our compliance plans.\nWe refer you to “—Our Mission, Competitive Strengths & Business Strategies — Our Commitment to Sustainability” for information related to our Environmental, Social and Governance strategy.\nPermits for Glacier Bay, Alaska\nIn connection with certain Alaska cruise operations, we rely on concession permits from the U.S. National Park Service to operate our ships in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. We currently hold a concession permit allowing for 41 calls annually through September 30, 2029.\nPassenger and Crew Well-Being\nIn the U.S., we must meet the U.S. Public Health Service’s requirements, which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the Vessel Sanitation Program of the CDC and the FDA. In addition, the cruise industry and the U.S. Public Health Service have agreed on regulations for food, water and hygiene, aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to U.S. ports.\nWe continue to work directly with the CDC Maritime Unit as well as other health regulatory authorities, such as E.U. Healthy Gateways, to adjust our infectious disease (COVID-19, influenza, noro virus) response protocols.\nSecurity and Safety\nThe IMO has adopted safety standards as part of the SOLAS convention, which apply to all our ships. SOLAS establishes requirements for vessel design, structural features, construction methods and materials, refurbishment standards, life-saving equipment, fire protection and detection, safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew. All our crew undergo regular security and safety training exercises pursuant to international and national maritime regulations.\nSOLAS requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”). All of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ISM Code. Each such certificate is granted for a five-year period and is subject to periodic verification.\nThe SOLAS requirements are amended and extended by the IMO from time to time. For example, the International Port and Ship Facility Code (“ISPS Code”) was adopted by the IMO in December 2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments, port authorities and shipping companies.\n​\n23\nAmendments to SOLAS required that ships constructed in accordance with pre-1974 SOLAS requirements install automatic sprinkler systems. IMO adopted an amendment to SOLAS which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of non-combustible construction. The SOLAS regulation implemented Long-Range Identification and Tracking. All our ships are in compliance with the requirements of SOLAS as amended and/or as applicable to the keel-laying date.\nIn addition to the requirements of the ISPS Code, the U.S. Congress enacted the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) which implements a number of security measures at ports in the U.S. including measures that apply to ships registered outside the U.S. while docking at ports in the U.S. The U.S. Coast Guard has published MTSA regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the U.S., provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships. The Transportation Workers Identification Credential is a U.S. requirement for accessibility into and onto U.S. ports and U.S.-flagged ships.\nMaritime-Labor\nIn 2006, the International Labor Organization (“ILO”), an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor standards, adopted a new Consolidated Maritime Labor Convention (“MLC 2006”). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO since 1920. MLC 2006 includes a broad range of requirements, such as a broader definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation, food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. MLC 2006 added requirements not previously in effect, in the areas of occupational safety and health. MLC 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing August 2013. The Standard of Training Certification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers, as amended (“STCW”), establishes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watch-keeping for our seafarers.\nFinancial Requirements\nThe Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify passengers in the event of non-performance of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands is required to maintain a $32.0 million third-party performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to passengers. The guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments.\nIn addition, our brands have a legal requirement to maintain security guarantees based on cruise business originated from the U.K., and certain jurisdictions require us to establish financial responsibility to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2023, we have in place approximately £62.4 million of security guarantees for our brands as well as a consumer protection policy covering up to £107.9 million. The Company has provided approximately $1.5 million in cash to secure all the financial security guarantees required.\nCompliance with these regulations has had an impact on our financial condition. From time to time, various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the U.S. and the cruise industry in general. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business.\nFor information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, see “Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, including the risk factor titled “We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety, labor, data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our operations and certain recently introduced laws and regulations and future changes in laws and regulations could lead to increased costs and/or decreased revenue.”\n24\nTaxation\nU.S. Income Taxation\nThe following discussion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below.\nExemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883 of the Code\nUnder Section 883 of the Code (“Section 883”) and the related regulations, a foreign corporation will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation on its U.S.-source income derived from the international operation of ships (“shipping income”) if: (a) it is organized in a qualified foreign country, which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883; and (b) either: (1) more than 50% of the value of its stock is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country; (2) one or more classes of its stock representing, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the U.S. (the “publicly-traded test”); or (3) it is a “controlled foreign corporation” (a “CFC”) for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50% of its stock is owned by qualified U.S. persons for more than half of the taxable year (the “CFC test”). In addition, U.S. Treasury Regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements.\nNCLH is incorporated in Bermuda, which is a qualified foreign country that grants an equivalent exemption, and NCLH meets the publicly-traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).  The NYSE is considered to be an established securities market in the United States. Therefore, we believe that NCLH qualifies for the benefits of Section 883.\nWe believe and have taken the position that substantially all of NCLH’s income, including the income of its ship-owning subsidiaries, is properly categorized as shipping income, and that we do not have a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that the IRS’ interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify (or will not qualify) as shipping income. Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under Section 883. There are factual circumstances beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary shares, which could cause NCLH or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under Section 883. Further, any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income, and we can give no assurances on this matter.\nUnder certain circumstances, changes in the identity, residence or holdings of NCLH’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause NCLH’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under Section 883. Therefore, as a precautionary matter, NCLH has provided protections in its bye-laws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly-traded test by prohibiting any person from owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 4.9% of NCLH’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by NCLH’s Board of Directors (the “4.9% limit”). Any outstanding shares held in excess of the 4.9% limit will be transferred to and held in a trust.\nFor 2023, 2022 and 2021, both Regent and Oceania Cruises relied on NCLH’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of Section 883 as discussed above.\n25\nTaxation of International Shipping Income Where Section 883 of the Code is Inapplicable\nUnless exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, a foreign corporation is subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the United States. If we fail to qualify for the exemption under Section 883 in respect of our U.S.-sourced shipping income, or if the provision was repealed, then we will be subject to taxation in the U.S. on such income.\nGenerally, “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses. For these purposes, shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States, which we refer to as “U.S.-source shipping income,” will be considered to be 50% derived from sources within the United States.\nIf we do not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then any U.S.-sourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxation on a net basis (generally at a 21% rate) and state and local taxes, and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax and branch-level interest tax of 30%, unless a lower treaty rate applies (the “Net Tax Regime”). Our U.S.-source shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of U.S.-source shipping income, and substantially all of our U.S.-source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States.\nIf we do not have a fixed place of business in the U.S. or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation, the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income. In that case, we would be subject to a special 4% tax on our gross U.S.-source shipping income (the “4% Tax Regime”).\nOther United States Taxation\nU.S. Treasury Regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, to the extent derived from U.S. sources, are subject to U.S. federal income taxes under the Net Tax Regime discussed above. Income items considered non-incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of single-day cruises, shore excursions, air and other transportation, and pre- and post-cruise land packages. We believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income.\n26\nIncome from U.S.-flagged Operations\nIncome derived from our U.S.-flagged operation generally will be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels. In addition, any dividends paid by our U.S.-flagged operations to NCLC would be considered subject to a dividend withholding tax of 30%.  In 2023, we expect that such income will not be subject to U.S. branch profits tax nor a U.S. dividend withholding tax under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty.\nBermuda Income Taxation\nPreviously, NCLH, NCLC and their Bermuda subsidiaries obtained an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 that, in the event that any legislation was enacted in Bermuda imposing any tax, including tax on profits or income among others, such tax would not be applicable to them until March 31, 2035.  Such assurances were superseded by the passage of new legislation as described below.\nOn December 27, 2023, the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (“the Bermuda Act”) was enacted in Bermuda.  Under the Bermuda Act, the corporate income tax will be determined based on a statutory tax rate of 15% effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The corporate income tax will apply only to Bermuda tax resident businesses that are part of multinational enterprise groups with €750 million or more in annual revenues in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the year in question. Although the Government of Bermuda has already released limited guidance with respect to specific provisions of the Bermuda Act, it is anticipated that further administrative guidance as well as regulatory guidance will be released over the course of the 2024 calendar year and beyond.\nAs enacted, the Bermuda Act makes it clear that any corporate income tax liability is due regardless of the above assurances under the Exempted Undertakings Protection Act 1966. Therefore, NCLH, NCLC and their Bermuda subsidiaries will be subject to the Bermuda corporate income tax with effect from January 1, 2025.\nThe Bermuda Act provides for an international shipping income exclusion. In order for a Bermuda entity’s international shipping income to qualify for the exclusion, the entity must demonstrate that the strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned is effectively carried on from or within Bermuda. NCLH expects it will meet the necessary requirements to qualify for the international shipping income exclusion during 2024.\nAdditionally, the Bermuda Act provides for companies to be able to offset 80% of their Bermuda taxable income with any tax loss deductions available on an annual basis. The Bermuda Act provides for opening tax loss carryforwards based on the Bermuda taxable income (loss) results of the individual Bermuda entities in the five fiscal years prior to the enactment date, which includes 2020 through 2024 calendar years for Norwegian, which can be carried forward indefinitely. Refer to Note 12 – “Income Taxes” for more information.\nU.K. Income Taxation\nNCLH and NCLC migrated their tax residency from the United Kingdom to Bermuda on December 31, 2023.    Therefore, NCLH and NCLC were subject to normal U.K. corporation tax through December 31, 2023.\nCertain State, Local and Non-U.S. Tax Matters\nWe may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property, or operations involving foreign property may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.\n27\nChanges in Tax Laws\nThe various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover, we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty on income derived in respect of our U.S.-flagged operation. For example, the OECD and numerous jurisdictions have had an increased focus on issues concerning the taxation of multinational businesses and have adopted several related reforms including the implementation of a global minimum tax rate of at least 15% for large multinational businesses starting January 1, 2024 or later, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these developments in global tax reform, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company realigned its organizational structure in Bermuda due to the inclusion of the international shipping income exclusion in the Bermuda Act, which we believe provides an ability for the Company to exempt a significant amount of its income. We expect global tax reform will continue to evolve over the coming years, and we will continue to monitor any new developments and assess impacts to the Company.\nHuman Capital\nOur people are the driving force of our past, current and future success. We aim to empower our team members worldwide, providing them opportunities to grow and develop and comprehensive benefits that support them to thrive both physically and mentally. We believe this commitment to empower people allows us to attract and retain top talent, while simultaneously providing robust career development opportunities that ultimately result in significant value to our Company. Reflecting this commitment, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. was recognized by Forbes with inclusion on its 2023 list of World’s Best Employers and by Newsweek with inclusion on its 2024 list of America’s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity.\nIn 2023, the company reinforced our commitment to culture by redefining our culture value anchors of Collaboration, Innovation, Transparency and  Passion. We have prioritized developing and expanding the culture framework throughout the organization for 2024. We believe our culture and commitment to our team members attract and retain top talent, while simultaneously providing robust career development opportunities that ultimately results in significant value to our Company and its shareholders.\nDemographics\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 5,100 full-time employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 35,900 shipboard employees. Regent and Oceania Cruises’ ships use a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant staffing onboard. We refer you to “Item 1A—Risk Factors— Our failure or inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place.\nDiverse and Inclusive Culture\nOur Company is committed to fostering an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to generate and execute on innovative ideas.  This commitment is also demonstrated by our Board of Directors, which is 50% diverse with three female directors and one director from an under-represented minority community.\nOur Company operates globally, with team members representing over 110 countries. To foster a diverse and inclusive culture, we seek to leverage the talents of all team members and commit to equal employment opportunity (“EEO”) as detailed in our Company’s EEO policy. We have long-term partnerships with the National Diversity Council, sponsoring the Florida Diversity Council and its South Florida local chapter. We have established shoreside employee resource\n28\ngroups, such as the Veterans Task Force, Elevate (Women in Leadership) and Embrace (Diversity in Leadership), to support our team members and to serve as a feedback channel for employees. In 2023, following listening sessions with team members, NCLH PRIDE was established as a new resource group for our LGBTQ+ community and its allies.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the composition of our workforce was as follows:\nCompensation and Benefits\nCritical to our success is identifying, recruiting, retaining top talent and incentivizing existing and future team members.  We attract and retain talented team members by offering competitive compensation and benefits. Our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy for our shoreside team is based on rewarding each team member’s individual contributions. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay components including base salary, bonus, equity, commissions and merit increases. We maintain a long-term incentive plan for our manager-level team members and above that allows us to provide share-based compensation to enhance our pay-for-performance culture and to support our attraction, retention and motivational goals. We have established an $18 per hour minimum wage for our non-commission U.S. based shoreside employees. We also issued an appreciation bonus of up to 10 days of pay to non-management employees not eligible under other bonus or incentive programs. The Company also consistently reviews salary levels in order to remain competitive in recruiting and retaining talent for shoreside and shipboard employees. We believe our compensation programs for our shipboard team are competitive and for the majority of this team, negotiated with various unions and documented in collective bargaining agreements.\nThe success of our Company is connected to the well-being of our team members, such that we offer a competitive benefits package including physical, financial and emotional well-being benefits. We offer our full-time U.S. shoreside team members a choice of Company-subsidized medical and dental programs to meet their needs and those of their families.  In addition, we offer health savings and flexible spending accounts, vision cover, paid time off, employee assistance programs, short term disability and voluntary long-term disability insurance, term life and business travel insurance.  We offer a 401(k) retirement savings plan and education assistance benefits. In 2023, we announced our reinstatement of 401(k) company matching and the student loan repayment program for 2024. Our benefits vary by location and are designed to meet or exceed local requirements and to be competitive in the marketplace. As we strive to be an employer of choice, the Company continues with a 4/1 flexible work model for shoreside team members globally. The flexible model allows most employees to work in-office Monday through Thursday and remotely on Friday.\nWe proudly offer Family Care Benefits to our eligible shoreside employees that includes paid leave at 100% of an employee’s salary, for maternity, paternity, and adoption leaves.

Our cruise benefit programs were further enhanced for team member’s friends and family across our brands.\nIn 2023, the NCLH Wellness at Sea initiative was introduced to shipboard team members to create a wellness-conscious work environment on the vessels. We are committed to providing crew members with guidelines, resources and activities for educational purposes and to guide them to achieve optimal wellness. Topics in this initiative address nutrition, physical activity, sleep and stress management and alcohol and tobacco awareness to name a few.\nTraining and Development\nThe opportunity to grow and develop skills and experience, regardless of job role, division or geographic location is critical to the success of the Company as a global organization. We actively foster a culture of learning and offer a variety of developmental courses for our team members. We provide a mentorship program where even our most senior leaders actively participate.  Succession planning is part of our culture.  We have a year-round focus on providing team members with opportunities to develop their leadership skills and add to our bench of talent through various training initiatives. Succession planning and talent review programs allow us to continuously calibrate and evaluate high potential talent, offering talent rotations and investing in development for long-term success.\nEstablished in 2021, Rising Stars remains a key development program to identify high potential shoreside leaders at the Director and Senior Director level.  The 6-month program is conducted with a human resources strategy firm and is focused on developing a growth mindset to refine leadership strengths, champion change and encourage innovation through assessment tools, one-on-one coaching and group learning. We have had successful rates of promotion and retention of Rising Stars graduates.\nShipboard team members have the opportunity to learn the skills and responsibilities of another position in a different department, either to increase their effectiveness in the Company, or to give them the opportunity to shift their career path.\nRetention and Engagement\nWe have a history of strong retention rates across our shoreside and shipboard teams which we attribute to our culture that allows our team members to thrive and achieve their career goals. For the full year of 2023, the Company experienced its highest shoreside voluntary retention rate as compared to the prior four years.\nWith the launch of new vessels across all three brands, team members were provided opportunities to sail aboard our new ships throughout the inaugural seasons to experience and familiarize themselves with the product delivered to our guests.\nExceptional team members continue to be recognized by a robust annual Award of Excellence recognition program which acknowledges and rewards individual team members and teams for their demonstration of Company values.  In 2023, the Award of Excellence winners were celebrated by the NCLH President & CEO and senior leadership team onboard Regent Seven Seas Grandeur. We have also continued the Kloster Visionary Award which honors the Company’s founder, Knut Kloster, by recognizing a shipboard or shoreside team member whose spirit of innovation follows in the footsteps of this visionary. Through the shipboard Vacation Hero Awards program, shipboard supervisors and management recognize select shipboard team members that have proven to be outstanding in selected categories. This award program is designed to provide recognition and promote total guest satisfaction by encouraging and rewarding team members for demonstrating excellence in service, teamwork, attitude and leadership.\nPorts and Facilities\nWe own a private island in The Bahamas, Great Stirrup Cay, which we utilize as a port-of-call on certain itineraries.

    "text": "In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business. If any of the risks discussed or additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The ordering of the risk factors below is not intended to reflect an indication of priority or likelihood. In connection with the forward-looking statements that appear in this Annual Report, you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward–Looking Statements.”\n​\nDebt/Liquidity Related Risk Factors\n​\nIf our results of operations and financial performance do not recover as planned, we may not be in compliance with maintenance covenants in certain of our debt facilities.\n​\nCertain of our debt facilities include maintenance and financial covenants. For example, under the Sixth ARCA, we are required to maintain a loan to value ratio of less than 0.70 to 1.00. Financial covenants include free liquidity of no less than $250,000,000 at all times, a total net funded debt to total capitalization ratio and an EBITDA to consolidated debt service ratio of at least 1.25 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter unless free liquidity is greater than or equal to $300,000,000 at that time. If we expect to not be in compliance, we would expect to seek waivers from the lenders under these facilities or renegotiate these facilities prior to any covenant violation.\n​\nAny covenant waiver or renegotiation of any of our debt facilities has led, and may in the future lead, to increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections that would be applicable to us under these debt facilities, and such increased costs, restrictions and modifications may vary among debt facilities. Our ability to provide additional lender protections under these facilities will be limited by the restrictions in our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain waivers or renegotiate these facilities in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. If we were not able to obtain a covenant waiver under any one or more of these debt facilities or renegotiate such facilities, we would be in default of such agreements, which could result in cross defaults to our other debt agreements. As a consequence, we would need to refinance or repay the applicable debt facility or facilities, and would be required to raise additional debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay such facility or facilities. If we were to be unable to obtain a covenant waiver under any one or more of these debt facilities or renegotiate these facilities, there can be no assurance that we would be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay such facility or facilities.\n​\nWith respect to each of these debt facilities, if we were unable to or did not obtain a waiver, renegotiate or refinance or repay such debt facilities, it would lead to an event of default under such facilities, which could lead to an acceleration of the indebtedness under such debt facilities. In turn, this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which includes a significant portion of our assets including our ships. Any such action would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, the failure to obtain the covenant waivers or renegotiate our facilities as described above would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to service our debt obligations.\n​\nWe anticipate that we will need additional financing in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and our outstanding exchangeable notes and any future financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders.\n​\nWe anticipate that we will need additional equity and/or debt financing in the future to refinance our existing debt and to fund our newbuild program. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all, depending on market and other conditions. The ability to raise additional financing depends on numerous factors that are outside of our control, including general economic and market conditions, the health of financial institutions, our credit ratings and investors’ and lenders’ assessments of our prospects and the prospects of the cruise industry in general.\n34\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants, which may be more restrictive than the covenants in our existing debt agreements, and we may be required to further encumber our assets. We may not have sufficient available collateral to pledge to support additional financing. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures, which could negatively affect our business. Our credit ratings, which have been downgraded in the past, could be further downgraded, which could have an impact on the availability and/or cost of financing. In addition, we may conclude that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to operate as a going concern, which could have additional effects on our credit ratings and the availability and/or cost of financing. There can be no assurance that our ability to access the credit and/or capital markets will not be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy. If we are not able to fulfill our liquidity needs through operating cash flows and/or borrowings under credit facilities or otherwise in the capital markets, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected and it may be necessary for us to reorganize our company in its entirety, including through bankruptcy proceedings, and our shareholders may lose their investment in our ordinary shares.\n​\nIf we raise additional funds through equity and/or debt issuances, NCLH’s shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to that of holders of NCLH’s ordinary shares. Further, the exchange of some or all of our outstanding exchangeable notes may dilute the ownership interests of NCLH’s shareholders. Upon exchange of any of the exchangeable notes, any sales in the public market of NCLH’s ordinary shares issuable upon such exchange could adversely affect prevailing market prices of NCLH’s ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the exchangeable notes may encourage short selling by market participants that engage in hedging or arbitrage activity, and anticipated exchange of any of the exchangeable notes into NCLH ordinary shares could depress the price of NCLH’s ordinary shares.\n​\nOur indebtedness, and the agreements governing our indebtedness, may limit our flexibility in operating our business and a substantial majority of our assets are collateral under our debt agreements.\n​\nA substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness, which may limit our available funds for other business functions and strategic opportunities and may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, the economy and the industry in which we operate. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, including refinancing our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\n​\nIn addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness contain, and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain, covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preference shares; pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments, including the ability of NCLH’s subsidiaries, including NCLC, to pay dividends or make distributions to NCLH; repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make certain investments or acquisitions; transfer, sell or create liens on certain assets; and consolidate or merge with, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to other companies. As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\n​\nThe impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets could increase our counterparty credit risks, including those under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees.\n​\nEconomic downturns, including failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis, can disrupt the capital and credit markets. Such disruptions could cause counterparties under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them, which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements. Also, we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties\n35\nunder our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements. If we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments, we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty. Any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument.\n​\nAny further impairment of our trade names or goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n​\nWe evaluate trade names and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. Several factors including a challenging operating environment impacts affecting consumer demand or spending, the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations. Reductions of the cash flows used in the impairment analyses may result in the recording of an impairment charge to a reporting unit’s trade name or goodwill. For example, we recognized significant impairment losses during 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments. However, a change in our estimated future operating cash flows may result in a decline in fair value in future periods, which may result in a need to recognize additional impairment charges.\n​\nOperational Related Risk Factors\n​\nUnavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nWe believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. The availability of ports is affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, health, safety, and environmental concerns, existing capacity constraints, security, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, typhoons and earthquakes, financial limitations on port development, political instability, armed conflicts, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors, governmental regulations, including sanctions, and fees, local community concerns about port development and tourism. For example, currently and in the past, regulatory changes, disease outbreaks resulting in a global pandemic, armed conflicts and damages to ports from hurricanes have prohibited our cruise voyages from visiting certain regions, including Cuba, Russia, Japan and some ports in the Caribbean. There can be no assurance that our ports of call will not be similarly affected in the future. Due to environmental and over-crowding concerns, some local governments have begun to take measures to limit the number of cruise ships and passengers allowed at certain destinations. For example, Dubrovnik, Venice and Barcelona have either implemented or considered implementing such limitations on cruise ships and passengers. Limitations on the availability of ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports have adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations in the past and could do so in the future.\n​\nWe rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger and crew connections. Increases in the price of, or major changes, significant delays and disruptions, or reduction in, commercial airline services has, and could in the future, disrupt our operations.\n​\nA number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises. Increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices, fuel surcharges, changes in commercial airline services as a result of health and safety events, strikes or other staffing shortages, weather or other events, or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings has and could adversely affect our ability to transport guests and crew to or from our ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which, in turn, has an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, many commercial airlines reduced services, experienced staffing shortages and suffered other disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic conditions. COVID-19 related regulations  also prevented us from using commercial airline services to transport our crew members to and from our ships, which resulted in increased costs to our Company.\n​\nGlobal events and conditions, including terrorist acts, armed conflicts, acts of piracy, and other international events impacting the security of travel or the global economy, or threats thereof, could adversely affect our business.\n36\n​\nGlobal events and conditions, including the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts, outbreaks of hostilities or armed conflict, political unrest and instability, the issuance of government travel advisories or elevated threat warnings, increases in the activity of pirates, and other geo-political uncertainties, or the possibility or fear of such events, have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on our business. Any of these events or conditions may adversely affect demand for, and by extension pricing of, our cruises. Such events or conditions may also have downstream effects on the global economic environment, including increased fuel and commodity pricing, supply chain shortages, labor shortages, volatility in the global capital markets, contraction of the global economy leading to decreased consumer discretionary spending, and other effects impossible to predict at this time.\n​\nArmed conflicts, including Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, have also impacted, and could in the future impact, our profitability and product offering by limiting the destinations to which we can travel and our operations by making it more difficult to source crew members and third-party vendors from affected regions and making it more difficult or costly to source goods we need to run our operations or to build or maintain our ships. Further, armed conflicts have contributed to extreme volatility in the global financial markets and have had, and may continue to have, further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets and heightened volatility of commodity fuel prices. Such volatility or disruptions have had, and may continue to have, adverse consequences to our business, our suppliers and our customers. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy, capital markets or commodity fuel prices resulting from armed conflicts and other geopolitical tensions.\n​\nPublic health crises have had, and may in the future have, a significant impact on our financial condition, results, operations, outlook, plans, goals, growth, reputation, cash flows, liquidity, demand for voyages and share price.\n​\nPublic health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have significant negative impacts on all aspects of our business. In March 2020, we implemented a voluntary suspension of all cruise voyages across our three brands due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We began resuming cruise voyages in July 2021 in a phased manner and completed the phased relaunch of our entire fleet in early May 2022. This caused significant costs and lost revenue as a result of, among other things, the suspension of cruise voyages, implementation of additional health and safety measures, reduced demand for cruise vacations, guest compensation, itinerary modifications, redeployments and cancellations, travel restrictions and advisories, the unavailability of ports and/or destinations and protected commissions. We were also negatively impacted by adverse impacts to our travel agencies and suppliers due to COVID-19, and we may experience similar impacts in the event of a future pandemic or other public health crises.\n​\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to heightened governmental regulations, travel advisories, travel bans and restrictions that have and could significantly impact our global guest sourcing and our access to various ports of call around the globe. We have had instances of disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, on our ships and there is no guarantee that the health and safety protocols we implement will be successful in preventing the spread of infectious disease onboard our ships and among our passengers and crew.\n​\nWe have been and may in the future be the subject of lawsuits and investigations stemming from outbreaks of infectious disease. We cannot predict the number or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results, but any such impact may be material.\n​\nEpidemics, pandemics and viral outbreaks or other wide-ranging public health crises in the future would likely also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nAdverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nThe operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters, including, but not limited to, oil spills and other environmental mishaps, extreme weather conditions such as\n37\nhurricanes, floods and typhoons, fire, mechanical failure, collisions, human error, war, terrorism, piracy, political action, civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events. Any such event may result in loss of life or property, loss of revenue or increased costs and the frequency and severity of natural disasters may increase due to climate change. The operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port, including missing guests, inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes, which may bring into question passenger safety, may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us. We have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships in the past and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future. It is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased port-related and other costs resulting from such adverse events. Any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight. An adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us. The expanded use of social media has increased the speed that negative publicity spreads and makes it more difficult to mitigate reputational damage. Anything that damages our reputation (whether or not justified), could have an adverse impact on demand, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If there is a significant accident, mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship, we may have to place a ship in an extended Dry-dock period for repairs. This could result in material lost revenue and/or increased expenditures.\n​\nOur business depends on maintaining and strengthening our brand to attract new customers and maintain ongoing demand for our offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand could harm our results of operations.\n​\nOur name and brand image are integral to the growth of our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Our ability to execute our marketing and growth strategy depends on many factors, including the perceived quality of our services, the impact of our communication activities, including advertising, social media, and public relations, and our management of the customer experience, including direct interfaces through customer service. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand are important to expanding our customer base and will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer experiences.\n​\nWe have used, and expect to continue to use, corporate partnerships, brand ambassadors, traditional, digital, and social media to promote our business. Marketing campaigns can be expensive and may not result in the cost-effective acquisition of customers. Ineffective marketing, ongoing and sustained promotional activities, negative publicity, unfair labor practices, and failure to protect the intellectual property rights in our brand are some of the potential threats to the strength of our brand, and those and other factors could rapidly and severely diminish customer confidence in us. Furthermore, actions taken by individuals that we partner with, such as brand ambassadors, influencers or our associates, that fail to represent our brand in a manner consistent with our brand image, whether through our social media platforms or their own, could also harm our brand reputation and materially impact our business. Future marketing campaigns may not attract new customers at the same rate as past campaigns. If we are unable to attract new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business could be harmed.\n​\nThe adverse impact of general economic and related factors, such as fluctuating or increasing levels of interest rates, unemployment, underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices, declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence. The demand for cruises is affected by international, national and local economic conditions.\n​\nThe demand for cruises is affected by international, national and local economic conditions. Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in North America or globally, such as the volatility of fuel prices, higher interest rates, stock and real estate market declines and/or volatility, more restrictive credit markets, higher unemployment or underemployment rates, inflation, higher taxes, changes in governmental policies and political developments impacting international trade, trade disputes and increased tariffs, could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests. Consequently, this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries, which are a discretionary purchase. Decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting or lower Occupancy Percentages, which, in turn, could reduce the profitability of our\n38\nbusiness. In addition, these conditions could also impact our suppliers, which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us.\n​\nBreaches in data security or other disturbances to our information systems and other networks or our actual or perceived failure to comply with requirements regarding data privacy and protection could impair our operations, subject us to significant fines, penalties and damages, and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nThe integrity and reliability of our information systems and networks are crucial to our business operations and a breach, compromise, damage or other disruption to these systems or networks could impair our operations, have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand. In addition, certain networks are dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. Among other things, actual or threatened natural disasters, information systems failures, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks and other cybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions to our information systems, telecommunications and other networks. Our business continuity, disaster recovery, data restoration plans and data and information system security may not prevent disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results. We carry limited business interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations, subject to limitations, exclusions and deductibles.\n​\nAs part of our ordinary business operations, we and certain of our third-party service providers collect, process, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information. The security of the systems and networks where we and our service providers store this data is a critical element of our business. We experience cybersecurity threats and incidents of varying degrees on our systems and networks and, as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained in the past, and may in the future obtain, access to our computer systems and networks, including cloud-based platforms. The technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers, vendors, service providers and partners have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such attacks. Cybersecurity threats can include computer viruses, malware, worms, hackers and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including physical and electronic break-ins, router disruption, sabotage or espionage, disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering (including through social engineering such as phishing attacks), impersonation of authorized users and coordinated denial-of-service attacks. There can be no assurance that a breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future. In addition, we may not be in a position to promptly address security breaches, unauthorized access or other cybersecurity incidents or to implement adequate preventative measures if we are unable to immediately detect such incidents. Our failure to successfully prevent, mitigate or timely respond to such incidents could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation.\n​\nWe are also subject to laws in multiple jurisdictions relating to the privacy and protection of personal data. Noncompliance with these laws or the compromise of information systems used by us or our service providers resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests, prospective guests, employees or vendors could result in governmental investigation, civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business. Additionally, any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment. The regulatory framework for data privacy and protection is uncertain for the foreseeable future, and it is possible that legal and regulatory obligations may continue to increase and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent or possibly conflicting from one jurisdiction to another.\n​\nIn the event of a data security breach of our systems and/or third-party systems or a cybersecurity incident, we may incur costs associated with the following: response, notification, forensics, regulatory investigations, public relations, consultants, credit identity monitoring, credit freezes, fraud alert, credit identity restoration, credit card cancellation, credit card reissuance or replacement, data restoration, regulatory fines and penalties, vendor fines and penalties, legal fees, damages and settlements. In addition, a data security breach or cybersecurity incident may cause business interruption, information system disruption, disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation or litigation, digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data, loss of company assets, damage to our reputation, damages to intangible\n39\nproperty and other intangible damages, such as loss of consumer confidence, all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n​\nChanges in fuel prices and the type of fuel we are permitted to use and/or other cruise operating costs would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increased costs related to fuel prices.\n​\nFuel expense is a significant cost for our Company. Future increases in the cost of fuel globally or regulatory requirements which require us to use more expensive types of fuel, including more costly alternate fuel sources, would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations. For example, as of January 2020, the IMO’s convention entitled Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 0.5% (reduced from the previous 3.5% global limit). Various compliance methods, such as the use of low-sulfur fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions, may be utilized. We have elected to install exhaust gas cleaning systems on some ships in our fleet, which will allow us to continue to use high-sulfur fuel on those ships in certain areas. However, the significant drop in demand for high-sulfur fuel due to the previous pandemic-related pause in operations has made it more difficult to source high-sulfur fuel going forward, which may increase our fuel costs. Ships in our fleet that do not have exhaust gas cleaning systems, and in specified areas even ships with exhaust gas cleaning systems, will be required to use low-sulfur fuels. Low-sulfur fuels may be costly due to increased demand and scarcity if suppliers are not able to produce sufficient quantities. We will also be required to use alternate fuel sources in the future as regulations aimed at reducing carbon intensity have been introduced and we may choose to use alternative fuels in order to achieve any emissions reduction targets we have and may in the future adopt. For example, the IMO adopted two requirements that went into effect in 2023, the Carbon Intensity Indicator and Energy Efficiency Ship Index, which each regulate carbon emissions for ships, and the E.U. has begun to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from passenger and cargo ships over 5,000 Gross Tons under its Emissions Trading System beginning in 2024. In addition, we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability resulting from increases or volatility in fuel expense. Our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs, and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions, including choice of hedging instruments, breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties. To the extent that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly, such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future. Additionally, deterioration in our financial condition could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future.\n​\nMechanical malfunctions and repairs, delays in our shipbuilding program, maintenance and refurbishments and the consolidation of qualified shipyard facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n​\nThe new construction, refurbishment, repair and maintenance of our ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction, refurbishment and repair projects. Our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident, which we have occasionally experienced and have had to repair. For example, in the past we have had to delay or cancel cruises due to mechanical issues on our ships. There can be no assurance that we will not experience similar events in the future. If there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future, we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service, especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment, such as the radar, a pod propulsion unit, the electrical/power management system, the steering gear or the gyro system. Limited capacity and availability of shipyards and related subcontractors, including a lack of viable drydock facilities in the Western Hemisphere, could impact our ability to construct or repair ships as needed. Delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises and/or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships.\n​\nIn addition, availability, work stoppages, insolvency or financial problems in the shipyards’ construction, refurbishment or repair of our ships, other “force majeure” events that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors, or changes to technical specifications due to regulatory changes, sustainability initiatives or other strategic initiatives could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery, refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships. Any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us, potential claims and impairment of losses. A significant delay in the delivery of a\n40\nnew ship, or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have an adverse effect on our business. The impacts of global events including armed or geopolitical conflicts and pandemics, a lack of viable drydock facilities, modifications the Company plans to make to its newbuilds, including initiatives to improve environmental sustainability, and other macroeconomic events have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries, and may result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future, which may be prolonged. The consolidation of the control of certain European cruise shipyards could result in higher prices for the construction of new ships and refurbishments and could limit the availability of qualified shipyards to construct new ships. Also, the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis. Additionally, we are reliant on a third party to oversee certain newbuild and Dry-dock projects. Any occurrence that prevented such third party from continuing to oversee such projects or substantially increased the costs related to such oversight could have an adverse effect on our operations. These potential events and the associated losses, to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n​\nConducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks.\n​\nWe operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks, including political risks, risks of increases in duties and taxes, risks relating to anti-bribery laws, as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses, or governing the operations of foreign-based companies may change. Additional risks include imposition of trade barriers, withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures, including value added taxes. If we are unable to address these risks adequately, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n​\nOperating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees or agents may engage in conduct prohibited by our policies, but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible. If our employees or agents violate our policies, if we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties.\n​\nOur failure or inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nWe must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. We need to hire and train a considerable number of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years. This may require significant efforts on the part of our management team, and our failure or inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect our business. Currently, we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with certain crew members. Any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition. In addition, although our collective bargaining agreements have a no-strike provision, they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future. Any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n​\nOur executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. The loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us.\n​\nNegative perceptions about the cruise industry, carbon intensity, sustainability or otherwise may make it increasingly difficult to retain and hire additional crew members to staff our fleet and to recruit new employees generally.\n41\n​\nImpacts related to climate change may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nThere has been an increased focus on GHG and other emissions from global regulators, consumers and other stakeholders. Regulations addressing climate change that have already been adopted or are being considered, as described under “Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment in Which We Operate,” may have significant adverse impacts to our profitability and operations. In addition, concern about climate change may cause consumers to avoid certain kinds of travel including cruise and air travel, which could impact our ability to source guests. Increasing concerns about GHG emissions may attract scrutiny from investors and may make it more difficult and/or costly for us to raise capital. Our ships, port facilities, corporate offices and island destinations have in the past and may again be adversely affected by an increase in the frequency and intensity of adverse weather conditions caused by climate change. For example, certain ports have become temporarily unavailable to us due to hurricane damage and other destinations have either considered or implemented restrictions on cruise operations due to environmental concerns. We expect to make significant investments in technology, equipment and alternative fuels in order to achieve any climate-related targets we may set and to comply with climate-related regulations, and our profitability and operations may be adversely impacted by such investments. These investments may have costs beyond our expectations and may not ultimately benefit us as expected. The actions we take to meet our emissions reduction goals and requirements are expected to result in delays to our shipbuilding program. Our ability to achieve our sustainability commitments and goals will depend on a number of variable factors, some of which are outside of our control. We may fall short of any sustainability goals we set, including those disclosed in this report, which may result in negative impacts to our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, backlash against our sustainability initiatives and commitments may harm our reputation among other stakeholders and expose us to related liabilities.\n​\nOur inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nThere can be no assurance that our risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance. Such losses, to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance, could affect our financial results. In addition, we have been and continue to be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our own claim records, but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability. Our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us. If we, or other members of our protection and indemnity associations, were to sustain significant losses in the future, our ability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all could be materially adversely affected. For example, in the past our protection and indemnity associations have increased certain deductibles and determined not to cover certain categories of claims. Moreover, irrespective of the occurrence of such events, there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all.\n​\nLitigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation.\n​\nOur business is subject to various U.S. and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances, it may not be economical to defend against such matters, and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n​\nAs a result of any ship-related or other incidents, litigation claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area, may be asserted or brought against various parties, including us and/or our cruise brands. The time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims, actions and investigations. Subject to applicable insurance\n42\ncoverage, we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and for any judgments, fines, civil or criminal penalties if such claims, actions or investigations are adversely determined.\n​\nThe U.S. Government announced that, effective May 2, 2019, it would no longer suspend the right of private parties to bring litigation under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996, popularly known as the Helms-Burton Act, allowing certain individuals whose property was confiscated by the Cuban government beginning in 1959 to sue anyone who \"traffics\" in the property in question in U.S. courts. One such certified claim against us is pending and additional claims may be brought against us in the future. If this suit is successful after we have exhausted our ability to appeal, we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages. We cannot predict the number or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results, but any such impact may be material.\n​\nWe rely on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services, and we are exposed to risks facing such providers. In certain circumstances, we may not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us.\n​\nWe rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services, such as technology and payment processing services, that are vital to our business. If these service providers suffer financial hardship or suffer disruptions or are unable to continue providing such services, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers in a timely manner, which may cause an interruption in our operations. To the extent that we are able to replace such service providers, we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services. Both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the third-party service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results.\n​\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, purchase and own assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar; most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against our other major currencies may adversely affect our U.S. dollar financial results and will reduce the U.S. dollar amount received upon conversion of these currencies into U.S. dollars.\n​\nWe have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies. While we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts, we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro would have a negative impact on our financial performance to the extent that these contracts have not been hedged. Additionally, if a shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract, any associated foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated.\n​\nOur expansion into new markets and investments in new markets and land-based destination projects may not be successful.\n​\nWe believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger sourcing into major markets in the future, such as Europe and Australia, as well as into emerging markets and to expand our itineraries in new markets. Expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management. There can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have also made, and plan to continue to make, investments in land-based projects including port facilities and destination projects that are susceptible to impacts from, among other things, weather events, regulatory restrictions, labor risks,\n43\nshortages of goods and materials and resistance from local populations. Any such impacts to our land-based projects could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nOvercapacity in key markets or globally could adversely affect our operating results.\n​\nWe continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program and expect to add additional ships to our fleet. Our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their fleets. These increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause us to lower pricing, which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, older ships in our fleet may not be as competitive as new ships enter the market and we may not be able to sell such older ships at optimal prices.\n​\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment in Which We Operate\n​\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety, labor, data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our operations and certain recently introduced laws and regulations and future changes in laws and regulations could lead to increased costs and/or decreased revenue.\n​\nIncreasingly stringent and complex international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations addressing environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations. The IMO, a United Nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships, the Council of the European Union, individual countries, the United States, and individual states have implemented and are considering, new laws and rules to manage cruise ship operations. Many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to international treaties such as SOLAS, an international safety regulation, MARPOL, IMO’s requirements governing environmental protection, and STCW, an IMO regulation governing ship manning. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Coast Guard both have regulations addressing cruise ship operations.\n​\nThe U.S. and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies aimed at restricting or taxing emissions, including those of greenhouse gases, requiring the use of low-sulfur fuels, requiring the use of shore power while in port, increasing fuel efficiency requirements, reducing the threat of invasive species in ballast water, and improving sewage and greywater-handling capabilities. For example, MARPOL regulations have established special Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”) with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions from fuel burning aboard ships. Ships operating in designated ECAs are generally expected to meet the new sulfur oxide emissions limits through the use of low-sulfur fuels or installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems. In 2021, the IMO adopted two requirements that went into effect in 2023, the Carbon Intensity Indicator (the “CII”) and Energy Efficiency Ship Index (the “EEXI”), which each regulate carbon emissions for ships. The CII is an operational metric designed to measure how efficiently a ship transports goods or passengers by looking at carbon dioxide emissions per nautical mile. Ships are given an annual rating from A to E with a C or better required for compliance. For ships that receive a D rating for three consecutive years, or an E rating for one year, a corrective action plan will need to be developed and approved. Beginning in 2023, ships are now required to reduce carbon intensity by 5% from a 2019 baseline, with 2% incremental improvements each year thereafter until 2030. The EEXI is a design re-certification requirement that updates energy efficiency requirements for existing ships and regulates carbon dioxide emissions related to installed engine power, transport capacity and ship speed. In addition, in December 2022, the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission reached an agreement on including the maritime transport sector in the E.U.’s carbon dioxide Emissions Trading System. Under the directive ships over 5,000 Gross Tons that transport passengers or cargo to or from E.U. member state or EEA ports are required to purchase and surrender emissions allowances equivalent to emissions for all or a half of a covered voyage, depending on whether the voyage was between two E.U. or EEA ports or an E.U. or EEA and a non-E.U. or EEA port. The requirements are to be phased in from 2024 to 2026. Beginning in 2024, covered entities are required to procure and surrender allowances equivalent to 40% of their carbon emissions, with the amount increasing to 70% of carbon emissions in 2025 and 100% of GHG emissions in 2026.\n​\nCompliance with such laws and regulations have resulted in increased costs to our Company and are expected to entail significant expenses for a combination of: ship modifications, purchases of emissions allowances, alternative fuels and\n44\nhigher-cost compliant newbuilds. Compliance is also expected to result in changes to our operating procedures, including limitations on our ability to operate in certain locations and slowing the speed of our ships and may render some ships obsolete, which would adversely impact our operations. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, areas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. We may not be able to comply with future and existing regulations and may be subject to fines, penalties and limitations on our ability to operate.  Some environmental groups continue to lobby for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact.\n​\nAdditionally, in the past, states have implemented taxes that impact the cruise industry. It is possible that other states, countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees and/or guests, which could increase our operating costs and/or could decrease the demand for cruises.\n​\nChanges in tax laws, or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n​\nWe believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income (“shipping income”), is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes under Section 883, based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “Item 1—Business—Taxation.” The provisions of Section 883 are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.\n​\nWe believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify (or will not qualify) as shipping income. Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which NCLH will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly-traded test under Section 883 as described in “Item 1—Business—Taxation—Exemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883 of the Code.” There are factual circumstances beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary shares, which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption. Finally, any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Regime (each as defined in “Item 1—Business—Taxation”), and we can give no assurances on this matter.\n​\nIf we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under Section 883, our or such subsidiary’s U.S.-source income would be subject to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Regime (each as defined in “Item 1—Business—Taxation”). As of the date of this filing, we believe that NCLH and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly-traded test imposed under Section 883 and therefore believe that NCLH will qualify for the exemption under Section 883. However, as discussed above, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause NCLH to not meet the stock ownership or publicly-traded tests. Therefore, we can give no assurances on this matter. We refer you to “Item 1—Business—Taxation.”\n​\nWe may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.\n​\nThe various tax regimes to which we have historically been subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. For example, the OECD and numerous jurisdictions have had an increased focus on issues concerning the taxation of multinational businesses and have adopted several related reforms, including the implementation of a global minimum tax rate of at least 15% for large multinational businesses starting January 1, 2024 or later, which could have a material adverse effect on our aggregate tax liability and effective tax rate. During the fourth quarter of 2023, in response to the OECD’s BEPS\n45\n2.0 Pillar 2 global tax reform, the Company restructured its organizational structure by realigning many of its operations across its three different brands into a single jurisdiction, Bermuda.  In connection with the reorganization, among other steps, certain NCLH subsidiaries were redomiciled to Bermuda.  If our assumptions and interpretations regarding the global minimum tax rules or our efforts to reorganize prove to be incorrect for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We expect global tax reform will continue to evolve over the coming years and will continue to monitor these developments.\n​\nAdditionally, previously we obtained an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 that, in the event that any legislation is enacted in Bermuda imposing any tax, including tax on profits or income among others, such tax shall not be applicable to them until March 31, 2035.  Such assurances were superseded by the passage of new legislation as described below.\n​\nOn December 27, 2023, the Bermuda Act was enacted in Bermuda. Under the Bermuda Act, the corporate income tax will be determined based on a statutory tax rate of 15% effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The corporate income tax will apply only to Bermuda tax resident businesses that are part of multinational enterprise groups with €750 million or more in annual revenues in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the year in question. Although the Government of Bermuda has already released limited guidance with respect to specific provisions of the Bermuda Act, it is anticipated that further administrative guidance as well as regulatory guidance will be released over the course of the 2024 calendar year and beyond.\n​\nAs enacted, the Bermuda Act makes it clear that any corporate income tax liability is due regardless of the above assurances under the Exempted Undertakings Protection Act 1966. Therefore, we expect to be subject to the Bermuda corporate income tax with effect from January 1, 2025. The Bermuda Act provides for an international shipping income exclusion.  In order for a Bermuda entity’s international shipping income to qualify for the exclusion, the entity must demonstrate that the strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned is effectively carried on from or within Bermuda. We expect we will meet the necessary requirements to qualify for the international shipping income exclusion during 2024, but we cannot provide any assurances. Additionally, the Bermuda Act provides for companies to be able to offset 80% of their Bermuda taxable income with any tax loss deductions available on an annual basis. The Bermuda Act provides for opening tax loss carryforwards based on the Bermuda taxable income (loss) results of the individual Bermuda entities in the five fiscal years prior to the enactment date, which includes 2020 through 2024 calendar years for the Company. If our assumptions and interpretations regarding the Bermuda Act prove to be incorrect for any reason, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n​\nIn addition, there cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of applicable tax laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could increase our effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nOur ability to comply with economic substance requirements in certain jurisdictions and increased costs associated with our efforts to comply may have a negative impact on our operations.\n​\nOur Company and certain of its subsidiaries are or may be subject to economic substance requirements in their jurisdictions of formation or continuation, including, but not limited to, Bermuda, Guernsey, Isle of Man, British Virgin Islands, the Bahamas and Saint Lucia. Pursuant to the legislation passed in each jurisdiction, entities subject to each jurisdiction’s laws that carry out relevant activities as specified in such laws, are required to demonstrate adequate economic substance in that jurisdiction.  In general terms, adequate economic substance means: (i) the entity is actually directed and managed in the jurisdiction; (ii) core income-generating activities relating to the applicable relevant activity are performed in the jurisdiction; (iii) there are adequate employees in the jurisdiction; (iv) the entity maintains adequate physical presence in the jurisdiction; and (v) there is adequate operating expenditure in the jurisdiction. We have evaluated the activities of NCLH, NCLC and their subsidiaries and have concluded that in some cases, those activities are 'relevant activities' for the purposes of the applicable economic substance laws and that, consequently, certain entities within our organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with these economic substance requirements. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to increased costs and our management team may be required to devote\n46\nsignificant time to satisfying economic substance requirements in certain of these jurisdictions. If such entities cannot establish compliance with these requirements, we may be liable to pay additional penalties and fines in the applicable jurisdictions and/or required to re-domicile such entities to different jurisdictions that may have tax regimes and other regulatory regimes which may be less favorable.\n​\nRisks Related to NCLH’s Ordinary Shares\n​\nShareholders of NCLH may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than shareholders of a U.S. corporation.\n​\nWe are a Bermuda exempted company. The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the “Companies Act”), which applies to NCLH, differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Taken together with the provisions of NCLH’s bye-laws, some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of NCLH than you would have as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation. This affects, among other things, the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable, whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our Company, what approvals are required for business combinations by our Company with a large shareholder or a wholly-owned subsidiary, what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the Companies Act or NCLH’s bye-laws, and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers.\n​\nNCLH does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\n​\nNCLH does not currently pay dividends to its shareholders and NCLH’s Board of Directors may never declare a dividend. Our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of NCLH’s subsidiaries, including NCLC, to pay distributions to NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. In addition, any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the discretion of NCLH’s Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, business opportunities, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that NCLH’s Board of Directors deems relevant. We are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends. In addition, NCLH is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to NCLH to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. Investors seeking dividends should not purchase NCLH’s ordinary shares.\n​\nProvisions in NCLH’s constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that NCLH’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.\n​\nNCLH’s bye-laws contain provisions that may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests. For instance, these provisions may prevent NCLH’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of NCLH’s shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of NCLH’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. These provisions include (i) the ability of NCLH’s Board of Directors to designate one or more series of preference shares and issue preference shares without shareholder approval; (ii) a classified board of directors; (iii) the sole power of a majority of NCLH’s Board of Directors to fix the number of directors; (iv) the power of NCLH’s Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on NCLH’s Board of Directors in most circumstances, including when such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise; and (v) advance notice requirements for nominating directors or introducing other business to be conducted at shareholder meetings.\n​\nAdditionally, NCLH’s bye-laws contain provisions that prevent third parties from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of its outstanding shares without the consent of NCLH’s Board of Directors and provide for the lapse of rights, and sale, of any shares acquired in excess of that limit. The effect of these provisions may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in NCLH in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares.\n​\n47"

Our cybersecurity risks are considered individually as part of our enterprise risk management program alongside other risks, and prioritized and discussed with our Board of Directors.\n​\nOur internal Security Operations Center (“SOC”) has primary responsibility for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, and provides information security monitoring for both shoreside and shipboard information systems and applications.  The SOC is a team comprised of cybersecurity professionals who are responsible for real-time incident response management for our IT infrastructure, which includes our websites, applications, databases, servers, network devices and components and workstations. They are trained and equipped to identify, contain, analyze and investigate any perceived security threats as well as assist internal users with any information security questions or reported issues, such as phishing/scam emails, information security concerns and security solution related access or performance issues.\n​\nAs part of our cybersecurity program, team members are offered cybersecurity training and participate in awareness programs including phishing simulation exercises, regular cybersecurity newsletters and reminders and programming and events during cybersecurity awareness month.\n​\nOur processes also address cybersecurity threat risks associated with our use of third-party service providers, including those who have access to our customer, prospect, supplier or employee data or our systems. In addition, cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of our third-party service providers. We generally require that third-party service providers that access, host our data, or could otherwise introduce cybersecurity risk to us, enter into contracts that obligate them to manage their cybersecurity risks in certain ways and report any cybersecurity incidents to us.\n​\nWe engage third-party advisory firms to conduct assessments of the maturity of our security program and, among other measures, work to be Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) compliant where required. We also maintain incident response procedures and business continuity and contingency plans and periodically hire third parties to conduct vulnerability analyses. We also compare our processes to standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) and/or International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), as appropriate.\n​\nGovernance\n​\nThe Technology, Environmental, Safety and Security (“TESS”) Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our programs and policies related to data protection and cybersecurity and receives updates on related risks from our Chief Information Security Officer on at least an annual basis, and more often as the circumstances require. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors also receives updates, at least annually, from our Chief Information Officer and/or Chief Information Security Officer regarding cybersecurity and other information system compliance matters that may pose risks to our financial reporting or operations.\n​\nOur Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for our overall data security and cybersecurity risk reduction efforts, including information security compliance, training and awareness and application, network and system security. Our Chief Information Security Officer has 25 years of prior experience in the fields of information systems, cybersecurity, risk management, and infrastructure management. Our Chief Information Security Officer holds master’s and bachelor’s degrees in both Computer Information Systems and Business Administration and the following certifications: Certified Internal Controls Auditor (CICA), Payment Card Industry Professional (PCIP), Certified\n48\nInformation Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) and Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC).\n​\nWe discuss risks related to cybersecurity threats under the heading “Breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information systems and other networks or our actual or perceived failure to comply with requirements regarding data privacy and protection could impair our operations, subject us to significant fines, penalties and damages, and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations” included as part of our risk factor disclosures in Item 1A of this Annual Report, which disclosures are incorporated by reference herein. We are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition and any expenses we have incurred from cybersecurity incidents were immaterial.\n​"

    "text": "Financial Presentation\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results. You should read this information in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report. See also “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” immediately prior to Part I, Item 1 in this Annual Report.\nWe categorize revenue from our cruise and cruise-related activities as either “passenger ticket” revenue or “onboard and other” revenue. Passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering, the size of the ship in operation, the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates. Our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises, which has historically been strongest during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months; however, our cruise voyages were completely suspended from March 2020 until July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our resumption of cruise voyages was phased in gradually, with full operation of our fleet resumed in May 2022. Passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations, meals in certain restaurants on the ship, certain onboard entertainment, government taxes, fees and port expenses and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us. Onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from casino, beverage sales, shore excursions, specialty dining, retail sales, spa services and Wi-Fi services. Our onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires, from which we receive a share of their revenue.\nOur cruise operating expense is classified as follows:\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. We rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated\n52\nfinancial statements. These critical accounting policies, which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements, relate to ship accounting and asset impairment.\nShip Accounting\nShips represent our most significant assets, and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of ships is computed on a straight-line basis over the weighted average useful lives of primarily 30 years after a 15% reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship. Our residual value is established based on our long-term estimates of the expected remaining future benefit at the end of the ships’ weighted average useful lives. In 2022 and 2023, the Company took delivery of Norwegian’s first Prima Class Ship and Oceania Cruises’ first Allura Class Ship, respectively. Based on the design, structure and technological advancements made to these new classes of ships and the analyses of their major components, which is generally performed upon the introduction of a new class of ship, we have assigned the Prima Class Ships and Allura Class Ships a weighted-average useful life of 35 years with a residual value of 10%. Ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship. When we record the retirement of a ship component included within the ship’s cost basis, we estimate the net book value of the component being retired and remove it from the ship’s cost basis. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred. We account for Dry-dock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all Dry-dock costs as incurred.\nWe determine the weighted average useful lives of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the costs and useful lives of the ships’ major component systems on the date of acquisition, such as cabins, main diesels, main electric, superstructure and hull, and their related proportional weighting to the ship as a whole. The useful lives of components of new ships and ship improvements are estimated based on the economic lives of the new components. In addition, to determine the useful lives of the major components of new ships and ship improvements, we consider the impact of the historical useful lives of similar assets, manufacturer recommended lives, planned maintenance programs and anticipated changes in technological conditions. Given the large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require judgment and are uncertain. Should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher.\nIf circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we reduced our estimated weighted average ship service life by one year, depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 would have increased by $19.4 million. In addition, if our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by $84.4 million. We believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied. We believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage.\nAsset Impairment\nWe review our long-lived assets, principally ships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. For ship impairment analyses, the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities is each individual ship. We consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. Our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk.\n53\nWe evaluate goodwill and trade names for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. In 2023, we changed our annual evaluation date for impairment from December 31 to October 1. We believe this measurement date, which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, is preferable because it better aligns with the timing of the Company’s financial planning process, which is a key component of the annual impairment tests. The change in the measurement date did not delay, accelerate or prevent an impairment charge. The accounting policy change is not material and will be applied prospectively. For our evaluation of goodwill, we use a qualitative assessment which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For trade names we also provide a qualitative assessment to determine if there is any indication of impairment.\nIn order to make this evaluation, we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist:\nIt is at our discretion whether to perform the qualitative test and we may bypass the qualitative test in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. We may also, at our discretion, resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.\nWe believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our long-lived assets, principally ships, goodwill, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable. Nonetheless, if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. If a material change occurred or the result of the qualitative assessment indicated it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, we would conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value to its carrying value.\nWe have concluded that our business has three reporting units. Each brand, Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas and Norwegian, constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment.\nFor our annual impairment evaluation, we performed a quantitative assessment for the Regent Seven Seas reporting unit and of each brand’s trade names. Based on the results of the assessment, we determined there was no impairment of goodwill because the fair value of the Regent Seven Seas reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value. As of December 31, 2023, there was $98.1 million of goodwill remaining for the Regent Seven Seas reporting unit. Trade names were $500.5 million as of December 31, 2023. As of October 1, 2023, our annual impairment reviews support the carrying values of these assets. See Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information.\n54\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost, Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS, to enable us to analyze our performance. See “Terms Used in this Annual Report” for the definitions of these and other non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yield to manage our business on a day-to-day basis because it reflects revenue earned net of certain direct variable costs. We also utilize Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts our net income (loss), we believe changes in Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. Per Capacity Day data is not presented for the year ended December 31, 2022 as we do not consider it meaningful for comparison purposes due to our phased restart of cruise operations, which was completed in May 2022.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income (loss), as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.\nIn addition, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net income (loss) and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future adjustments or results. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $12.1 million related to restructuring costs or charges. We included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) since the expenses are not representative of our day-to-day operations; however, this adjustment did not occur and is not included in the comparative period presented within this Annual Report.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “Results of Operations” section.\nFinancing Transactions\nIn February 2023, NCLC issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028. The net proceeds from the notes were used to repay the loans outstanding under our Term Loan A Facility that otherwise would have become due in January 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.\nIn February 2023, our $1 billion commitment letter was extended through February 2024, with an option for NCLC to further extend the commitments through February 2025 at its election. Simultaneously, the amount of the commitment\n55\nwas reduced to $650 million, which may be drawn in up to two draws, and in connection with the execution of the current commitment letter, NCLC issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior secured notes due 2028. NCLC used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. In February 2024, we extended the $650 million undrawn commitment from February 2024 to March 2024 while maintaining our option to further extend the commitment. We are currently taking steps to refinance the commitment, which is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We expect the refinanced commitment to be extended for one year through March 2025, when effective.\nIn October 2023, NCLC issued $790 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior secured notes due 2029. The net proceeds from the notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the Term Loan A Facility, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses. No term loans remain outstanding.\nAlso in October 2023, NCLC entered into the Sixth ARCA, an amendment and restatement of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, which among other things, increased the aggregate amount of the Revolving Loan Facility from $875 million to $1.2 billion.\nSee Note 8 – “Long-Term Debt” for more information.\nUpdate on Bookings\n​\nThe Company continues to experience healthy consumer demand and is at an all-time high booked position and with pricing reflective of some of the best booking weeks in the Company’s history beginning with Black Friday and Cyber Monday. However, because of our cancellation policies, bookings may not be representative of actual revenues. Additionally, onboard revenue remains robust, with broad-based strength across all revenue streams.\n​\nAs a result of the ongoing conflict in Israel and the Red Sea, the Company cancelled and redirected all calls to Israel during the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, all calls to Israel and the Red Sea have been cancelled and redirected for the entirety of 2024. Prior to the conflict, approximately 7% of the capacity in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4% of capacity for the full year 2024 expected to visit the Middle East, which includes Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Approximately 1% of second quarter 2024 capacity and 1% of 2024 capacity were expected to sail through the Red Sea.\nMacroeconomic Trends and Uncertainties\nAs a result of conditions associated with global macroeconomic events, the global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has experienced volatility and disruptions, including impacts to inflation rates, fuel prices, foreign currencies and interest rates.  Our costs have been, and are expected to continue to be, adversely impacted by these factors. We have used, and may continue to use, derivative instruments to attempt to mitigate the risk of volatility in fuel prices and interest rates. In an attempt to mitigate risks related to inflation, our supply chain department has negotiated contracts with varying terms, with a goal of providing us with the ability to take advantage of cost declines when they occur, and diversified our sourcing options. These strategies may not fully offset the impact of current macroeconomic conditions; however, during 2023, we continued to see progress from our ongoing margin enhancement initiative. The Company continues to prioritize identifying and evaluating a variety of initiatives to improve its cost structure and margin profile, while preserving its brand equity and optimal guest satisfaction levels. Furthermore, we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for certain portions of ship construction contracts that have not been hedged. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report for additional information.\nClimate Change\nWe believe the increasing focus on climate change, including the Company’s recently established targets for greenhouse gas reductions, and evolving regulatory requirements will materially impact our future capital expenditures and results of operations. We have set interim targets to guide us on our path to net zero and provide more details about them in our annual ESG Report. We expect to incur significant expenses related to these regulatory requirements and commitments, which may include expenses related to greenhouse gas emissions reduction initiatives and the purchase of emissions\n56\nallowances, among other things. We have and may continue to be required to change certain operating procedures, for example slowing the speed of our ships, to meet regulatory requirements, which could adversely impact our operations. We are evaluating the effects of global climate change related requirements, which are still evolving, including our ability to mitigate certain future expenses through initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; consequently, the full impact to the Company is not yet known. Additionally, our ships, port facilities, corporate offices and island destinations have in the past and may again be adversely affected by an increase in the frequency and intensity of adverse weather conditions caused by climate change. For example, certain ports have become temporarily unavailable to us due to hurricane damage and other destinations have either considered or implemented restrictions on cruise operations due to environmental concerns. Refer to “Impacts related to climate change may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information.\nPillar 2 and Income Tax Expense\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, in response to changes in the global tax landscape due to the implementation of the OECD’s Pillar 2 global tax reform initiative, the Company restructured its organizational footprint by realigning many of its operations across its three different brands into a single jurisdiction, Bermuda, and exited our U.K. tax residency status for NCLH and NCLC as of December 31, 2023. The Company continues to monitor further regulations related to the implementation of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act, and the forecast of the Company’s non-exempt taxable income in the Bermuda and U.S. jurisdictions, and the outlooks for the cruise industry and broader economy. As a result of the enactment of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act 2023, the Company recognized additional deferred tax assets and has a valuation allowance related to our Bermuda deferred tax assets of $532.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The Bermuda deferred tax assets amount will continue to be evaluated through the enactment date, January 1, 2025, and is subject to material change as this is an estimated amount. Refer to Note 12 – “Income Taxes” for further information. Additionally, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance with respect to its U.S. net deferred tax assets, which has a balance of $159.8 million as of December 31, 2023. We will continue to evaluate all relevant positive and negative evidence in monitoring the realizability of our deferred tax assets and determining the appropriate timing for the recognition of any valuation allowance reversal. In the future, the Company may recognize a material reversal of its valuation allowance on both its U.S. and Bermuda deferred tax assets. The Company would not expect to have a material change in its income tax expense, with the exception of any potential impact from a release of the valuation allowance.\nExecutive Overview\nTotal revenue increased 76.5% to $8.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Capacity Days increased by 29.0%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had net income and diluted EPS of $166.2 million and $0.39, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net loss and diluted EPS of $(2.3) billion and $(5.41), respectively. Operating income increased to $930.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from an operating loss of $(1.6) billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe had Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS of $298.0 million and $0.70, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023, including $131.8 million of adjustments primarily consisting of share-based compensation, compared to Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS of $(1.9) billion and $(4.64), respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $(673.9) for the year ended December 31, 2022. We refer you to our “Results of Operations” below for a calculation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below compares the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31,\n2022.  You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. For a comparison of the Company’s results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2021, see “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and\n57\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2023.\n​\nWe reported total revenue, total cruise operating expense, operating income (loss) and net income (loss) as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\n​\n​\nThe following table sets forth operating data as a percentage of total revenue:\n​\n​\n58\nThe following table sets forth selected statistical information:\n​\n​\nAdjusted Gross Margin and Net Yield were calculated as follows (in thousands except Capacity Days and per Capacity Day data):\n​\n59\nGross Cruise Cost, Net Cruise Cost, Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel were calculated as follows (in thousands except Capacity Days and per Capacity Day data):\n​\n​\n​\n60\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS were calculated as follows (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n​\n​\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were calculated as follows (in thousands):\n​\n61\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 (“2023”) Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022 (“2022”)\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased 76.5% to $8.5 billion in 2023 compared to $4.8 billion in 2022. In 2023, revenue primarily increased as a result of increases in our Occupancy following our return to service with 23.3 million Passenger Cruise Days compared to 12.8 million in 2022.\nExpense\nTotal cruise operating expense increased 28.2% in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2023, our cruise operating expenses increased due to the resumption of voyages, resulting in higher payroll, food and direct variable costs of fully operating ships. In 2022, the year started with 16 ships operating with guests onboard and ended with the full fleet in service, which was completed in May 2022. Gross Cruise Cost increased 20.6% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily related to the change in costs described above.\nInterest expense, net was $727.5 million in 2023 compared to $801.5 million in 2022. The decrease in 2023 primarily reflects lower losses from extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs, which were $8.8 million in 2023 and  $193.4 million in 2022. Excluding these losses, interest expense increased primarily as a result of higher rates.\nOther income (expense), net was expense of $40.2 million in 2023 compared to income of $76.6 million in 2022. In 2023, the expense primarily related to net losses on foreign currency remeasurements. In 2022, the income was primarily due to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges and gains from foreign currency remeasurements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2023, our liquidity of $2.3 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $402.4 million, borrowings available under our $1.2 billion fully undrawn Revolving Loan Facility and a $650 million undrawn commitment less related fees. Our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and debt service. As of December 31, 2023, we had a working capital deficit of $4.7 billion. This deficit included $3.1 billion of advance ticket sales, which represents the total revenue we collected in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities. Our business model, along with our liquidity and\nundrawn export-credit backed facilities\n, allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating, investing and financing needs.\nIn February 2023, NCLC issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028. The net proceeds from the notes were used to repay the loans outstanding under our Term Loan A Facility that otherwise would have become due in January 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.\nIn February 2023, our $1 billion commitment letter was extended through February 2024, with an option for NCLC to further extend the commitments through February 2025 at its election. Simultaneously, the amount of the commitment was reduced to $650 million, which may be drawn in up to two draws, and in connection with the execution of the current commitment letter, NCLC issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior secured notes due 2028. NCLC used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. In February 2024, we extended the $650 million undrawn commitment from February 2024 to March 2024 while maintaining our option to further extend the commitment.\nIn October 2023, NCLC issued $790 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior secured notes due 2029. The net proceeds from the notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the Term Loan A Facility, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.\n62\nAlso in October 2023, NCLC entered into the Sixth ARCA, an amendment and restatement of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, which among other things, increased the aggregate amount of the Revolving Loan Facility from $875 million to $1.2 billion. No term loans remain outstanding.\nRefer to Note 8 – “Long-Term Debt” for further details about the above financing transactions.\nBased on our liquidity estimates and our current resources, we have concluded we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that the accuracy of the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct, and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to the dynamic nature of the current operating environment, including any current macroeconomic events and conditions such as inflation, rising fuel prices and higher interest rates.\nAs noted above, we extended the $650 million undrawn commitment from February 2024 to March 2024 while maintaining our option to further extend the commitment. In February 2024, the Commitment Parties (as defined in Note 8 – “Long-Term Debt”) entered into a third amended and restated commitment letter (the “third amended commitment letter”), which is expected to become effective in March 2024. The effectiveness is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Upon effectiveness, the third amended commitment letter will amend and restate the current commitment letter and extend the commitments thereunder through March 2025. Pursuant to the third amended commitment letter, and subject to effectiveness thereof, the Commitment Parties have agreed to purchase from NCLC an aggregate principal amount of $650 million of senior unsecured notes due five years after the issue date (the “Commitment Notes”) at NCLC’s option. If drawn, the Commitment Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (A) the greater of (i) the interest rate of the 7.75% senior notes due 2029 (“2029 Unsecured Notes”) and (ii) the then-current secondary trading yield applicable to the 2029 Unsecured Notes plus (B) 200 basis points. The Commitment Notes will be subject to a one-time structuring fee of 0.50% and a quarterly commitment fee of 0.75% for so long as the commitments with respect to the Commitment Notes are outstanding. If drawn, the Commitment Notes will be subject to an issue fee of 0.50%. In connection with the execution of the third amended commitment letter, and subject to effectiveness thereof, NCLC has agreed to repurchase all of the outstanding Class A Notes (as defined in Note 8 – “Long-Term Debt”) at a purchase price of 107% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\nWe also intend to refinance the $565.0 million 3.625% senior unsecured notes due in December 2024 prior to September 2024. Within the next twelve months, we may pursue other refinancings in order to reduce interest expense and/or extend debt maturities. There is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations. Beyond the next 12 months, we will pursue refinancings and other balance sheet optimization transactions in order to reduce interest expense and/or extend debt maturities. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for further details regarding risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ from our expectations.\nAt December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. If we do not continue to remain in compliance with our covenants, we would have to seek additional amendments to or waivers of the covenants. However, no assurances can be made that such amendments or waivers would be approved by our lenders.  Generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default and/or cross acceleration clauses, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated, which would have a material adverse impact to our operations and liquidity.\n​\nOur Moody’s long-term issuer rating is B2, our senior secured rating is B1 and our senior unsecured rating is Caa1. Our S&P Global issuer credit rating is B, our issue-level rating on our $1.2 billion Revolving Loan Facility, 2028 Senior Secured Notes and 2029 Senior Secured Notes is BB-, our issue-level rating on our other senior secured notes is B+ and our senior unsecured rating is CCC+. If our credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of any debt or equity financing will be further negatively impacted. We also have capacity to incur additional indebtedness under our debt agreements and may issue additional ordinary shares from time to time, subject to our authorized number of ordinary shares. However, there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.\n​\n63\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had advance ticket sales of $3.2 billion, including the long-term portion, which included approximately $78.0 million of future cruise credits. We also have agreements with our credit card processors that, as of December 31, 2023, governed approximately $2.9 billion in advance ticket sales that had been received by the Company relating to future voyages. These agreements allow the credit card processors to require under certain circumstances, including the existence of a material adverse change, excessive chargebacks and other triggering events, that the Company maintain a reserve which would be satisfied by posting collateral. Although the agreements vary, these requirements may generally be satisfied either through a percentage of customer payments withheld or providing cash funds directly to the card processor. Any cash reserve or collateral requested could be increased or decreased. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash collateral reserves of approximately $51.6 million, which includes $20.1 million recognized in accounts receivable, net and $31.5 million recognized in other long-term assets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received a return of cash collateral from one credit card processor of $500 million, which was previously classified as other long-term assets. We may be required to pledge additional collateral and/or post additional cash reserves or take other actions in the future that may adversely affect our liquidity.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nIn this section, references to 2023 refer to the year ended December 31, 2023, references to 2022 refer to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.0 billion in 2023 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $210.0 million in 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities included net income (loss) and the timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to operating assets and liabilities. The net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 included net income of $166.2 million and an increase in advance ticket sales of $503.7 million. The net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 included net losses of $(2.3) billion, an increase in advance ticket sales of $928.9 million and loss on extinguishment of debt of $188.8 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion in 2023, primarily related to three new ship deliveries and newbuild payments. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion in 2022, primarily related to the delivery of Norwegian Prima.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $346.9 million in 2023, primarily due to newbuild loans and $1.6 billion from our various note offerings, partially offset by debt repayments and a net decrease in our Revolving Loan Facility balance. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 billion in 2022, primarily due to newbuild loans and the proceeds of $2.1 billion from our various note offerings partially offset by debt repayments and related redemption premiums associated with extinguishment of certain senior secured notes.\nFor the Company’s cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, see “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2023.\nFuture Capital Commitments\nFuture capital commitments consist of contracted commitments, including ship construction contracts. Anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts are $0.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion for the years ending December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. We have export-credit backed financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of $0.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $0.8 billion for the years ending December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Anticipated non-newbuild capital expenditures are $475 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense.\nFor the Norwegian brand, we have four Prima Class Ships on order, each ranging from approximately 156,300 to 169,000 Gross Tons with 3,550 to 3,850 Berths, with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028. For\n64\nthe Oceania Cruises brand, we have an order for one Allura Class Ship to be delivered in 2025. The Allura Class Ship will be approximately 67,800 Gross Tons and 1,250 Berths.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the combined contract prices, including amendments and change orders, of the five ships on order for delivery was approximately €5.8 billion, or $6.4 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2023. We have obtained fixed-rate export-credit backed financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship on order, subject to certain conditions. We do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellations to occur. However, if any such events were to occur, it could result in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCapitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $56.4 million and $58.4 million, respectively, primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2023, our material cash requirements for debt and ship construction were as follows (in thousands):\n​\nFor other operational commitments for lease and port obligations we refer you to Note 5 – “Leases” and Note 13 – “Commitments and Contingencies,” respectively, for further information.\nFunding Sources\nCertain of our debt agreements contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital ratio and maintain certain other ratios. Approximately $16.2 billion of our assets are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt. We believe we were in compliance with our covenants as of December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of our subsidiaries, including NCLC, to make distributions and/or pay dividends to NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. NCLH is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to it to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. However, we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations.\n​\nWe believe our cash on hand, the impact of the undrawn commitment less related fees, borrowings available under our $1.2 billion fully undrawn Revolving Loan Facility, expected future operating cash inflows and our ability to issue debt securities or additional equity securities, will be sufficient to fund operations, debt payment requirements, capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next 12-month period. Refer\n65\nto “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—General” for further information regarding the debt covenant waivers and liquidity requirements.\n​\nOther\nCertain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business. The amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions.\nAs a routine part of our business, depending on market conditions, exchange rates, pricing and our strategy for growth, we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships, potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these transactions were to occur, they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness, through cash flows from operations, or through the issuance of debt, equity or equity-related securities.\nWe refer you to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—General” for information regarding collateral provided to our credit card processors."

    "text": "General\nWe are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives. The financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the notional, term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2023, 95% of our debt was fixed and 5% was variable. As of December 31, 2022, 75% of our debt was fixed and 25% was variable, which includes the effects of an interest rate swap that matured during the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in our fixed rate percentage from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the addition of fixed rate debt and refinancing variable rate debt with fixed rate debt. Based on our December 31, 2023 outstanding variable rate debt balance, a one percentage point increase in annual Term SOFR interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $6.8 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2023, future ship construction obligations aggregate €5.4 billion, or $6.0 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the ship construction obligations aggregated €4.5 billion, or $4.8 billion, based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2022. The change from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was due to an increase in contract price for our newbuild agreements. We estimate that a 10% change in the euro as of December 31, 2023 would result in a $0.6 billion change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments.\nFuel Price Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships. Fuel expense, as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense, was 13.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 16.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022. We use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of December 31, 2023, we had hedged approximately 53% and 21% of our 2024 and\n66\n2025 projected metric tons of fuel purchases, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had hedged none of our 2024 or 2025 projected metric tons of fuel purchases. Additional fuel swaps were executed between December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 to lower our fuel price risk.\nWe estimate that a 10% increase in our weighted-average fuel price would increase our anticipated 2024 fuel expense by $63.7 million. This increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of $34.1 million. Fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach. These valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity, as well as other inputs such as fuel types, fuel curves, creditworthiness of the counterparty and the Company, as well as other data points.\n​"

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon management’s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023, to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO Framework”). Based on this evaluation under the COSO Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report, as stated in their report, which is included on page F-1.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n67\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only the reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions.\n​"

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the COSO.\n​\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible instruments in 2021.\n​\nBasis for Opinions\n​\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n​\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n​\nOur audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n​\n​\nF-1\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n​\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n​\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n​\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nShip Accounting – New Ships and Ship Improvements\nAs described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated ships and ship improvements balances were $18.5 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2023, respectively. Management determines the weighted average useful lives of ships based on estimates of the costs and useful lives of the ships’ major component systems on the date of acquisition, such as cabins, main diesels, main electric, superstructure and hull, and their related proportional weighting to the ship as a whole. In 2023, the Company took delivery of Oceania Cruises’ first Allura Class Ship. Based on the design, structure and technological advancements made to this new class of ship and the analysis of its major components, which is generally performed upon the introduction of a new class of ship, management assigned the Allura Class Ships a weighted-average useful life of 35 years. A residual value of 10% was established based on management’s long-term estimates of the expected remaining future benefit at the end of the ships’ weighted average useful lives. Additionally, the Company capitalized approximately $204.2 million of costs associated with ship improvements during the year ended December 31, 2023. Ship improvement costs that management believes add value to the ships are capitalized to the ship. The useful lives of components of new ships and ship improvements are estimated based on the economic lives of the new components. To determine the useful lives of the major components of new ships and ship improvements, management considers the historical useful lives of similar assets, manufacturer recommended lives, planned maintenance programs, and anticipated changes in technological conditions.\n​\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to ship accounting for new ships and ship improvements is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments by management when determining (i) the useful lives of the major components of new ships and ship improvements; (ii) whether ship improvement costs add value to the ships and are capitalizable; and (iii) the residual value of the new class of ship based on management’s expectation of remaining future benefit. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to (i) the appropriateness of the useful lives of the major components of new ships and ship improvements; (ii) whether ship improvement costs add value to the Company’s ships\nF-2\nand are capitalized appropriately; and (iii) whether the residual value assigned to the new class of ship is appropriate. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n​\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s assessment of the useful lives of the major components of new ships and ship improvements, whether ship improvements add value and are capitalized appropriately, and whether the residual value assigned to the new class of ship is appropriate. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the reasonableness of the useful lives assigned to the major components of new ships and ship improvements, considering the historical useful lives of similar assets, manufacturer recommended lives, planned maintenance programs, and anticipated changes in technological conditions; (ii) evaluating whether costs capitalized extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the ship, including testing the accuracy, existence and valuation of capitalized ship improvement costs; and (iii) evaluating the residual value assigned to the new class of ship. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the assigned useful lives of the major components of new ships and ship improvements, and residual value of the new class of ship.\n​\nMiami, Florida\nFebruary 28, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1988. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company.\n​\n​\nF-3\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n​\n​\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n​\nF-4\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n(in thousands)\n​\n​\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n​\nF-5\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share data)\n​\n​\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n​\nF-6\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(in thousands)\n​\n​\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n​\nF-7\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity\n(in thousands)\n​\n​\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n​\nF-8\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n​\nWe are a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. As of December 31, 2023, we had\n32\nships with approximately\n66,500\nBerths and had orders for\nfive\nadditional ships currently scheduled to be delivered. We have\nfour\nPrima Class Ships on order with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028.\nWe have\none\nAllura Class Ship on order for delivery in 2025. These additions to our fleet are expected to increase our total Berths to approximately\n82,500\n.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, in response to the OECD’s BEPS 2.0 Pillar 2 global tax reform, the Company restructured its organizational structure by realigning many of its operations across its three different brands into a single jurisdiction, Bermuda.  In connection with the reorganization, among other steps, certain NCLH subsidiaries previously domiciled in the Isle of Man, the Cayman Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Panama and the state of Delaware, were redomiciled to Bermuda\n​\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had liquidity of approximately $\n2.3\nbillion, including cash and cash equivalents of $\n402.4\nmillion, borrowings available under our $\n1.2\nbillion undrawn Revolving Loan Facility and the impact of our $\n650\nmillion undrawn commitment of Class B Notes and Backstop Notes issuable by NCLC less related fees (see Note 8 – “Long-Term Debt”). We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our obligations and expect to remain in compliance with our financial covenants for at least the next\ntwelve months\nfrom the issuance of these financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. Estimates are required for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and actual results could differ from these estimates. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are stated at cost and include cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less at acquisition.\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments include time deposits with original maturities of greater than three months and up to 12 months, which are stated at cost and present insignificant risk of changes in value.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable are shown net of an allowance for credit losses of $\n13.2\nmillion and $\n14.0\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Accounts receivable, net includes $\n20.1\nmillion and $\n118.4\nmillion due from credit card processors within 12 months as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nF-9\nInventories\nInventories mainly consist of provisions, supplies and fuel and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method of accounting.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Expenses related to advertising costs totaled $\n512.7\nmillion, $\n577.8\nmillion and $\n300.3\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted-average number of shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.\nA reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n​\n​\nEach exchangeable note (see Note 8 – “Long-Term Debt”) is individually evaluated for its dilutive or anti-dilutive impact on EPS as determined under the if-converted method. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the exchangeable notes have been excluded from diluted weighted-average shares outstanding because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive. Share awards are evaluated for a dilutive or anti-dilutive impact on EPS using the treasury stock method. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, a total of\n87.6\nmillion,\n92.6\nmillion and\n102.1\nmillion shares, respectively, have been excluded from diluted weighted-average shares outstanding because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. We determine the weighted average useful lives of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the costs and useful lives of the ships’ major component systems on the date of acquisition, such as cabins, main diesels, main electric, superstructure and hull, and their related proportional weighting to the ship as a whole. In 2023, the Company took delivery of Oceania Cruises’ first Allura Class Ship. Based on the design, structure and technological advancements made to this new class of ship and the analysis of its major components, which is generally performed upon the introduction of a new class of ship, we have assigned the Allura Class Ships a weighted-average useful life of\n35 years\n. A residual value of\n10\n% was established based on our long-term estimates of the expected remaining future benefit at the end of the ships’ weighted average useful lives. Ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship while costs of repairs and maintenance, including Dry-dock costs, are charged to expense as incurred. During ship construction, certain interest is capitalized as a cost of the ship. Gains or losses on the sale of property and equipment are recorded as a component of operating income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. The useful lives of components of new ships and ship improvements are estimated based on the economic lives of the new components. In addition, to determine the useful lives of the major components\nF-10\nof new ships and ship improvements, we consider the historical useful lives of similar assets, manufacturer recommended lives, planned maintenance programs and anticipated changes in technological conditions.\nDepreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, after a\n10\n-\n15\n% reduction for the estimated residual values of ships as follows:\n​\n​\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment, based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. For ship impairment analyses, the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities is each individual ship. We consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. Our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk.\nGoodwill and Trade Names\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets, principally trade names, are reviewed for impairment annually or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. In 2023, we changed our annual evaluation date for impairment from December 31 to October 1. We believe this measurement date, which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, is preferable because it better aligns with the timing of the Company’s financial planning process, which is a key component of the annual impairment tests. The change in the measurement date did not delay, accelerate or prevent an impairment charge. The accounting policy change is not material and will be applied prospectively. We may use a qualitative assessment which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For trade names we also may provide a qualitative assessment to determine if there is any indication of impairment.\nIn order to make this evaluation, we consider the following circumstances as well as others:\nF-11\nWe also may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. In 2023, this consisted of a discounted future cash flow model to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Our discounted cash flow valuation reflects our principal assumptions of 1) forecasted future operating results and growth rates, 2) forecasted capital expenditures for fleet growth and ship improvements and 3) a weighted average cost of capital of market participants, adjusted for an optimal capital structure. We believe that the approach was the most representative method to assess fair value as it utilized expectations of long-term growth as well as current market conditions. For the trade names, we may also use a quantitative assessment, which, in 2023, utilized the relief from royalty method and includes the same forecasts and discount rates from the discounted cash flow valuation in the goodwill assessment along with a trade name royalty rate assumption.\nWe have concluded that our business has\nthree\nreporting units. Each brand, Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas and Norwegian, constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment.\nFor our annual impairment evaluation, we performed a quantitative assessment for the Regent Seven Seas reporting unit and of each brand’s trade names. As of October 1, 2023, our annual review supports the carrying value of these assets.\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\nDeposits on advance ticket sales are deferred when received and are subsequently recognized as revenue ratably during the voyage sailing days as services are rendered over time on the ship. Cancellation fees are recognized in passenger ticket revenue in the month of the cancellation. Goods and services associated with onboard revenue are generally provided at a point in time and revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied. A receivable is recognized for onboard goods and services rendered when the voyage is not completed before the end of the period. All associated direct costs of a voyage are recognized as incurred in cruise operating expenses.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nRevenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors in various geographical regions.\nRevenues by destination consisted of the following (in thousands):\n​\nNorth America includes the U.S., the Caribbean, Canada and Mexico. Europe includes the Baltic region, Canary Islands\nand Mediterranean. Asia-Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and Asia. Other includes all other international\nterritories\n.\n​\n​\nF-12\nSegment Reporting\n​\nWe have concluded that our business has a single reportable segment. Each brand, Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent, constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the brand level operating results, and therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment. Our operating segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics, including similar long-term margins and similar products and services; therefore, we aggregate all of the operating segments into\none\nreportable segment.\nAlthough we sell cruises on an international basis, our passenger ticket revenue is primarily attributed to U.S.-sourced guests who make reservations through the U.S. Revenue attributable to U.S.-sourced guests was\n84\n%,\n85\n% and\n87\n% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNo other individual country’s revenues exceeded 10% in any of our last three years.\nSubstantially all of our long-lived assets are located outside of the U.S. and consist primarily of our ships. We had\n21\nships with Bahamas registry with a carrying value of $\n11.5\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and\n20\nships with Bahamas registry with a carrying value of $\n10.6\nbillion as of December 31, 2022. We had\n10\nships with Marshall Islands registry with a carrying value of $\n3.6\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and\neight\nships with Marshall Islands registry with a carrying value of $\n2.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2022. We also had\none\nship with U.S. registry with a carrying value of $\n0.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. For line of credit arrangements and for those debt facilities not fully drawn we defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset. These deferred issuance costs are amortized over the life of the loan. The amortization of deferred financing fees is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of cash flows; however, for purposes of the consolidated statements of operations it is included in interest expense, net.\nForeign Currency\nThe majority of our transactions are settled in U.S. dollars. We remeasure assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting gains or losses are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations within other income (expense), net. We recognized a loss of $\n28.7\nmillion, a gain of $\n55.8\nmillion and a gain of $\n20.9\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Remeasurements of foreign currency related to operating activities are recognized within changes in operating assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activity\nWe enter into derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices. The criteria used to determine whether a transaction qualifies for hedge accounting treatment includes critical terms match or regression analysis and high effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the derivative and the hedged forecasted transaction. As the derivative is marked to fair value, we elected an accounting policy to net the fair value of our derivatives when a master netting arrangement exists with our counterparties.\nA derivative instrument that hedges a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability may be designated as a cash flow hedge. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. To the extent that an instrument is not effective as a hedge or is no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses related to our effective hedges are recognized in the same line item\nF-13\nas the underlying hedged transactions. For presentation in our consolidated statements of cash flows, we have elected to classify the cash flows from our cash flow hedges in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nWe monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. Credit risk, including but not limited to counterparty non-performance under derivative instruments, our undrawn commitment and new ship progress payment guarantees, is not considered significant, as we primarily conduct business with large, well-established financial institutions and insurance companies that we have well-established relationships with and that have credit risks acceptable to us or the credit risk is spread out among a large number of creditors. We do not anticipate non-performance by any of our significant counterparties.\nInsurance\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks including claims related to crew and guests, hull and machinery, war risk, workers’ compensation, property damage, employee healthcare and general liability. Liabilities associated with certain of these risks, including crew and passenger claims, are estimated actuarially based upon known facts, historical trends and a reasonable estimate of future expenses. While we believe these accruals are adequate, the ultimate losses incurred may differ from those recorded.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in accordance with the liability method. Deferred taxes are recorded using the currently enacted tax rates that apply in the periods that the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred taxes are not discounted.\nWe provide a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. With respect to acquired deferred tax assets, changes within the measurement period that result from new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date shall be recognized through a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Subsequent to the measurement period, all other changes shall be reported as a reduction or increase to income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize expense for our share-based compensation awards using a fair-value-based method. Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards that are based on a service period and not contingent upon any future performance. We refer you to Note 11 – “Employee Benefits and Share-Based Compensation.”\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n, which aims to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 includes additional disclosures on an interim and annual basis and requires that the disclosures be applied to public entities that have a single reportable segment. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods after December 15, 2024. ASU will 2023-07 shall be applied retrospectively unless it is impracticable to do so. We will evaluate the impact of ASU 2023-07 on our notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n​\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, which requires improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information as well as certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and\nF-14\nshould be applied on a prospective basis. We will evaluate the impact of ASU 2023-09 on our notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n​\nNature of Goods and Services\nWe offer our guests a multitude of cruise fare options when booking a cruise. Our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities, meals, entertainment and government taxes, fees and port expenses. In some instances, cruise ticket prices include round-trip airfare to and from the port of embarkation, complimentary beverages, unlimited shore excursions, free internet, pre-cruise hotel packages, and on some of the exotic itineraries, pre- or post-land packages. Prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary, stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place. Passenger ticket revenue also includes full ship charters as well as government taxes, fees and port expenses.\nDuring the voyage, we generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare, including casino operations, certain food and beverage, gift shop purchases, spa services, Wi-Fi services and other similar items. Food and beverage, casino operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops, spa services, art auctions and internet services may be managed through contracts with third-party concessionaires. These contracts generally entitle us to a percentage of the gross sales derived from these concessions, which is recognized on a net basis. While some onboard goods and services may be prepaid prior to the voyage, we utilize point-of-sale systems for discrete purchases made onboard. Certain of our product offerings are bundled and we allocate the value of the bundled goods and services between passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue based upon the relative standalone selling prices of those goods and services.\nTiming of Satisfaction of Performance Obligations and Significant Payment Terms\nThe payment terms and cancellation policies vary by brand, stateroom category, length of voyage, and country of purchase. A deposit for a future booking is required at or soon after the time of booking. Final payment is generally due between\n120 days\nand\n180 days\nbefore the voyage. Deposits on advance ticket sales are deferred when received and include amounts that are refundable. Deferred amounts are subsequently recognized as revenue ratably during the voyage sailing days as services are rendered over time on the ship. Deposits are generally cancellable and refundable prior to sailing, but may be subject to penalties, depending on the timing of cancellation. The inception of substantive cancellation penalties generally coincides with dates that final payment is due, and penalties generally increase as the voyage sail date approaches. Cancellation fees are recognized in passenger ticket revenue in the month of the cancellation. Our standard payment and cancellation penalties apply for all sailings after March 31, 2023.\nGoods and services associated with onboard revenue are generally provided at a point in time and revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied. Onboard goods and services rendered may be paid at disembarkation. A receivable is recognized for onboard goods and services rendered when the voyage is not completed before the end of the period.\nCruises that are reserved under full ship charter agreements are subject to the payment terms of the specific agreement and may be either cancelable or non-cancelable. Deposits received on charter voyages are deferred when received and included in advance ticket sales. Deferred amounts are subsequently recognized as revenue ratably over the voyage sailing dates.\nContract Balances\nReceivables from customers are included within accounts receivable, net. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our receivables from customers were $\n126.4\nmillion and $\n94.2\nmillion, respectively, primarily related to in-transit credit card receivables.\nF-15\nContract liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to transfer goods and services to a customer. A customer deposit held for a future cruise is generally considered a contract liability only when final payment is both due and paid by the customer and is usually recognized in earnings within\n180 days\nof becoming a contract. Other deposits held and included within advance ticket sales or other long-term liabilities are not considered contract liabilities as they are largely cancelable and refundable. Our contract liabilities are included within advance ticket sales. Future cruise credits that have been issued as face value reimbursement for cancelled bookings due to COVID-19 are approximately $\n78.0\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The future cruise credits are not contracts, and therefore, guests who elected this option are excluded from our contract liability balance; however, the credit for the original amount paid is included in advance ticket sales.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our contract liabilities were $\n2.2\nbillion. Of the amounts included within contract liabilities as of December 31, 2023, approximately\n40\n% were refundable in accordance with our cancellation policies. Of the deposits included within advance ticket sales, the majority are refundable in accordance with our cancellation policies and it is uncertain to what extent guests may request refunds. As of December 31, 2022, our contract liabilities were $\n1.7\nbillion. Approximately $\n1.7\nbillion of the December 31, 2022 contract liability balance has been recognized in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur cruise voyages were completely suspended from March 2020 until July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our resumption of cruise voyages was phased in through May 2022. As a result of increases in our Occupancy following our return to service as well as our cancellation policies returning to our standard terms, there has been an increase in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2023. The addition of new ships also increases the contract liability balances as the number of sailings available for sale increases with each new ship. In 2023,\nthree\nnew ships were delivered. Additionally, cruises on Norwegian Aqua and Oceania Cruises’ Allura are available for sale.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nWe do not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. We recognize revenue in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance completed to date. Variable consideration, which will be determined based on a future rate and passenger count, is excluded from the disclosure and these amounts are not material. These variable non-disclosed contractual amounts relate to non-cancelable charter agreements and a service concession arrangement with a certain port, both of which are long-term in nature. Amounts that are fixed in nature due to the application of minimum guarantees are also not material and are not disclosed.\nContract Costs\nManagement generally expects that incremental commissions and credit card fees paid as a result of obtaining ticket contracts are recoverable; therefore, we recognize these amounts as assets when they are paid prior to the voyage. Costs of air tickets, port taxes and other fees that fulfill future performance obligations are also considered recoverable and are recorded as assets. Costs incurred to obtain customers were $\n231.9\nmillion and $\n184.0\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Costs to fulfill contracts with customers were $\n135.5\nmillion and $\n125.9\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Both costs to obtain and fulfill contracts with customers are recognized within prepaid expenses and other assets. Incremental commissions, credit card fees, air ticket costs, and port taxes and fees are recognized ratably over the voyage sailing dates, concurrent with associated revenue, and are primarily in commissions, transportation and other expense.\n​\nFor cruise vacations that had been cancelled by us due to COVID-19, approximately $\n0.3\nmillion and $\n36.3\nmillion in costs to obtain these contracts, consisting of protected commissions, including those paid to employees, and credit card fees, were recognized in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n​\nGoodwill and trade names are not subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying values were $\n98.1\nmillion for goodwill and $\n500.5\nmillion for trade names. We evaluate goodwill and trade names for impairment\nF-16\nannually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows (in thousands):\n​\nThe carrying value of our trade names was $\n500.5\nmillion, which consists of $\n207.5\nmillion for Norwegian Cruise Line, $\n140.0\nmillion for Oceania Cruises and $\n153.0\nmillion for Regent Seven Seas Cruises.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n5.\nLeases\nNature of Leases\nWe have operating leases primarily for port facilities and also corporate offices, warehouses, and certain equipment. Many of our leases include both lease and non-lease components. We have adopted the practical expedient which allows us to combine lease and non-lease components by class of asset. We have applied this expedient for office leases, port facilities, and certain equipment.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nLease balances were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nSupplemental cash flow and non-cash information related to leases was as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nF-17\nThe right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased primarily related to a modification of a port facility agreement.\n​\nOther supplemental information related to leases was as follows:\n​\n​\nAs of December 31, 2023, maturities of lease liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nSales-Type Lease\nWe have\none\nsales-type lease for constructed land-based transportation equipment and infrastructure. The remaining term of the lease is\n19 years\n. At the end of the lease term, the assets shall be conveyed to the lessee. As of December 31, 2023, the lease receivable is\n$\n40.4\nmillion and is recognized within accounts receivable, net and other long-term assets.\nThe maturities of the lease receivable as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\n​\nSignificant Assumptions and Judgments in Applying Topic 842 and Practical Expedients Elected\nOur leases contain both fixed and variable payments. Fixed payments and variable lease payments that depend on a rate or index are included in the calculation of the right-of-use asset. Other variable payments are excluded from the calculation unless there is an unavoidable fixed minimum cost related to those payments such as a minimum annual guarantee. Our lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis except for our rights to use port facilities. The expenses related to port facilities are amortized based on passenger counts as this basis represents the pattern in which the economic benefit is derived from the right to use the underlying asset.\nFor non-consecutive lease terms, which relate to our rights to use certain port facilities, the term of the lease is based on the number of days on which we have the right to use a specified asset. We have adopted the practical expedient to\nF-18\nexclude leases with terms of less than one year from being included on the balance sheet. Lease expense for agreements that are short-term are disclosed below and include both fixed and variable payments.\nCertain leases include one or more\noptions to extend\nor terminate and are primarily in\nfive-year\nincrements. Lease extensions and terminations, including auto-renewing lease terms, were only included in the calculation of the right-of-use asset to the extent that the right to renew or terminate was at the option of the lessor only or where there was a more than insignificant penalty for termination.\nAs our leases do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, we estimated our incremental borrowing rate to determine the net present value of the lease payments at the commencement date. Our incremental borrowing rate was estimated based on the rate we would have obtained if we had borrowed collateralized debt over the lease term to purchase the asset.\nWe have also adopted the practical expedient which allows us, by class of asset, to not separate lease and non-lease components when we are the lessor in the underlying transaction, the transactions would otherwise be accounted for under ASC 606–Revenue Recognition and the non-lease components are the predominant components of the agreements. We have applied this practical expedient to transactions with cruise passengers and concession service providers related to the use of our ships. We refer you to Note 3 – “Revenue and Expense from Contracts with Customers.”\n​\nLeases That Have Not Yet Commenced\n​\nWe have\none\nagreement related to our rights to use a port facility which is under construction. The lease term for this agreement has not commenced as of December 31, 2023. Although we may have provided design input or advances related to these assets, we have determined that we do not control the assets during the period of construction. The lease is expected to commence in 2024. This port facility has undiscounted minimum annual guarantees of approximately\n$\n141.1\nmillion of passenger fees.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nF-19\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nF-20\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\n​\nThe increase in ships was primarily due to the additions of Oceania Cruises’ Vista, Norwegian Viva and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur. The Company capitalized approximately $\n204.2\nmillion of costs associated with ship improvements and $\n96.0\nmillion associated with other information technology assets during the year ended December 31, 2023. Repairs and maintenance expenses including Dry-dock expenses were $\n160.8\nmillion, $\n223.5\nmillion and $\n199.7\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were recorded within other cruise operating expense.\nShips under construction include progress payments to the shipyard, planning and design fees and other associated costs. Capitalized interest costs which were primarily associated with the construction or revitalization of ships amounted to $\n56.4\nmillion, $\n58.4\nmillion and $\n43.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n​\n​\nF-21\nLong-term debt consisted of the following:\n​\nIn February 2023, NCLC issued $\n600.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n8.375\n% senior secured notes due February 1, 2028 (the “2028 Senior Secured Notes”). The 2028 Senior Secured Notes and related guarantees are secured by first-priority interests in, among other things and subject to certain agreed security principles, fourteen of our vessels that also secure the Sixth ARCA and the 2029 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below). The 2028 Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own the vessels that secure the 2028 Senior Secured Notes. NCLC may redeem the 2028 Senior Secured Notes at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to February 1, 2025, at a “make-whole” redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. NCLC may redeem the 2028 Senior Secured Notes at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time on or after February 1, 2025, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 2028\nF-22\nSenior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time and from time to time prior to February 1, 2025, NCLC may choose to redeem up to\n40\n% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Senior Secured Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings, subject to certain restrictions, at a redemption price equal to\n108.375\n% of the principal amount of the 2028 Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, so long as at least\n60\n% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Senior Secured Notes issued remains outstanding following such redemption. The 2028 Senior Secured Notes pay interest at\n8.375\n% per annum, semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, to holders of record at the close of business on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15, respectively.\n​\nThe net proceeds from the 2028 Senior Secured Notes were used to repay the loans outstanding under our Term Loan A Facility that otherwise would have become due in January 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.\n​\nThe indenture governing the 2028 Senior Secured Notes includes requirements that, among other things and subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, restrict the ability of NCLC and its restricted subsidiaries, as applicable, to (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, equity interests and make other restricted payments; (iii) make investments; (iv) consummate certain asset sales; (v) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (vi) grant or assume certain liens; and (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.\nIn July 2022, NCLC entered into a $\n1\nbillion amended and restated commitment letter (the “commitment letter”) with the purchasers named therein (collectively, the “Commitment Parties”), which superseded a $\n1\nbillion commitment letter previously executed in November 2021. The commitment letter, among other things, extended the commitments thereunder through March 31, 2023. In February 2023, NCLC and the Commitment Parties amended and restated the commitment letter (the “current commitment letter”) to extend $\n650\nmillion of commitments thereunder through February 2024, with an option for NCLC to further extend such commitments through February 2025 at its election. In February 2024, we extended the $\n650\nmillion undrawn commitment from February 2024 to March 2024 while maintaining our option to further extend the commitment. Pursuant to the current commitment letter, the Commitment Parties have agreed to purchase from NCLC an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n650\nmillion of senior secured notes at NCLC’s option. NCLC has the option to make up to\ntwo\ndraws, consisting of (i) $\n250\nmillion of senior secured notes due 2028 that, if issued, will accrue interest at a rate of\n11.00\n% per annum subject to a\n1.00\n% increase or decrease based on certain market conditions at the time drawn (the “Class B Notes”) and (ii) $\n400\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n8.00\n% senior secured notes due\nfive years\nafter the issue date (the “Backstop Notes”). The Class B Notes and the Backstop Notes are subject to a quarterly commitment fee of\n0.75\n% for so long as the commitments with respect to Class B Notes or the Backstop Notes, as applicable, are outstanding, which fee will be increased to\n1.00\n% if NCLC extends the commitments through February 2025 at its election. If drawn, the Class B Notes will be subject to an issue fee of\n2.00\n%, and the Backstop Notes will be subject to a quarterly duration fee of\n1.50\n%, as well as an issue fee of\n3.00\n%\n.\nIn February 2023, in connection with the execution of the current commitment letter, NCLC issued $\n250\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n9.75\n% senior secured notes due 2028 (the “Class A Notes” and, collectively with the Class B Notes and the Backstop Notes, the “Notes”), subject to an issue fee of\n2.00\n%. NCLC used the net proceeds from the Class A Notes for general corporate purposes. NCLC may redeem the Class A Notes at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to February 22, 2025, at a “make-whole” redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. NCLC may redeem the Class A Notes at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time on or after February 22, 2025, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Class A Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Class A Notes pay interest at\n9.75\n% per annum, quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, to holders of record at the close of business on the immediately preceding February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1, respectively.\nThe Class A Notes are, and the Class B Notes and the Backstop Notes, if issued, will be, secured by first-priority interests in, among other things and subject to certain agreed security principles, shares of capital stock in certain guarantors, our material intellectual property and two islands that we use in the operations of our cruise business. The\nF-23\nClass A Notes are, and the Class B Notes and the Backstop Notes, if issued, will be, guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own the property that secures the Notes as well as certain additional subsidiaries whose assets do not secure the Notes.\nThe indenture governing the Class A Notes includes requirements that, among other things and subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, restrict the ability of NCLC and its restricted subsidiaries, as applicable, to (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, equity interests and make other restricted payments; (iii) make investments; (iv) consummate certain asset sales; (v) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (vi) grant or assume certain liens; and (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.\nIn February 2023, NCLC entered into a Backstop Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“MS”), pursuant to which MS agreed to provide backstop committed financing to refinance and/or repay in whole or in part amounts then outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, we could, at our sole option, issue and sell to MS (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions)\nfive-year\nsenior unsecured notes up to an aggregate principal amount sufficient to generate gross proceeds of $\n300\nmillion at any time between October 4, 2023 and January 2, 2024. As a result of the refinancing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility in October 2023 (discussed below), the backstop committed financing was no longer applicable.\nIn April 2023, $\n82.5\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loan Facility due January 2024 was assigned to a new lender, and the maturity date was extended by one year to January 2025. The terms of the assigned principal were the same as the existing lenders who extended commitments in December 2022 under Amendment No. 4 to the Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nIn April 2023, we took delivery of Oceania Cruises’ Vista. We had export credit financing in place for\n80\n% of the contract price. The associated $\n632.6\nmillion term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of\n3.64\n% with a maturity date of April 30, 2035. Principal and interest payments are payable semiannually.\nIn May and June 2023, certain of NCLC’s export-credit backed facilities were amended to replace LIBOR with Term SOFR. In connection with these amendments, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”), which provided guidance to alleviate the burden in accounting for reference rate reform by allowing certain expedients and exceptions in applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions impacted by reference rate reform. The provisions apply only to those transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. As of June 30, 2023, we have applied certain optional expedients in our accounting for these amendments and the impact was immaterial.\nIn August 2023, we took delivery of Norwegian Viva. We had export credit financing in place for\n80\n% of the contract price. The associated $\n1.1\nbillion term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of\n2.77\n% with a maturity date of August 3, 2035. Principal and interest payments are payable semiannually.\nIn October 2023, NCLC issued $\n790.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n8.125\n% senior secured notes due January 15, 2029 (the “2029 Senior Secured Notes”). The 2029 Senior Secured Notes and related guarantees are secured by first-priority interests in, among other things and subject to certain agreed security principles, fourteen of our vessels that also secure the Sixth ARCA and the 2028 Senior Secured Notes. The 2029 Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own the vessels that secure the 2029 Senior Secured Notes. NCLC may redeem the 2029 Senior Secured Notes at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to January 15, 2026, at a “make-whole” redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. NCLC may redeem the 2029 Senior Secured Notes at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time on or after January 15, 2026, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 2029 Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time and from time to time prior to January 15, 2026, NCLC may choose to redeem up to\n40\n% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Secured Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings, subject to certain restrictions, at a redemption price equal to\n108.125\n% of the principal amount of the 2029 Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, so long as at least\n60\n% of the\nF-24\naggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Secured Notes issued remains outstanding following such redemption. The 2029 Senior Secured Notes pay interest at\n8.125\n% per annum, semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2024, to holders of record at the close of business on the immediately preceding January 1 and July 1, respectively.\nThe net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Secured Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the Term Loan A Facility, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.\nThe indenture governing the 2029 Senior Secured Notes includes requirements that, among other things and subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, restrict the ability of NCLC and its restricted subsidiaries, as applicable, to (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, equity interests and make other restricted payments; (iii) make investments; (iv) consummate certain asset sales; (v) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (vi) grant or assume certain liens; and (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.\nIn October 2023, NCLC entered into the Sixth ARCA, an amendment and restatement of the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Sixth ARCA, among other things, increased the aggregate amount of commitments under the Revolving Loan Facility from $\n875\nmillion to $\n1.2\nbillion. The Sixth ARCA and related guarantees are secured by first-priority interests in, among other things and subject to certain agreed security principles, fourteen of our vessels that also secure the 2028 Senior Secured Notes and the 2029 Senior Secured Notes. The commitments and any loans under the Revolving Loan Facility mature on October 18, 2026, provided that (a) if, on September 16, 2024, NCLC’s\n3.625\n% senior notes due December 2024 have not been repaid or refinanced with indebtedness maturing after January 16, 2027 and a liquidity test of $\n800\nmillion is not satisfied on that date, the maturity date will be September 16, 2024, (b) if, on May 2, 2025, NCLC’s 2025 Exchangeable Notes have not been repaid or refinanced with indebtedness maturing after January 16, 2027 and a liquidity test of $\n800\nmillion is not satisfied on that date, the maturity date will be May 2, 2025, and (c) if, on December 15, 2025, more than $\n300\nmillion of NCLC’s\n5.875\n% senior notes due March 2026 remain outstanding and the remainder has not been repaid or refinanced with indebtedness maturing after January 16, 2027, the maturity date will be December 15, 2025. Loans under the Revolving Loan Facility will accrue interest (x) in the case of alternate base rate loans, at a per annum rate based on an alternate base rate plus a margin of between\n0.00\n% and\n1.25\n% and (y) in the case of term benchmark loans, at a per annum rate based on the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a margin of between\n1.00\n% and\n2.25\n%. The commitments under the Revolving Loan Facility will accrue an unused commitment fee on the amount of available unused commitments at a rate of between\n0.15\n% and\n0.30\n%. The applicable margin and unused commitment fee will depend on the total leverage ratio as of the applicable date.\nThe Sixth ARCA also (a) increased the basket for Permitted Additional Debt (as defined in the Sixth ARCA) and increased the amount of such additional debt that may be secured on assets that are not collateral and (b) extended certain financial covenants through the amended maturity date. As described above, the net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Secured Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay all of the Term Loan A Facility, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.\nNo\nterm loans are outstanding under the Sixth ARCA.\nIn November 2023, we took delivery of Regent’s Seven Seas Grandeur. We had export credit financing in place for\n80\n% of the contract price. The associated $\n543.8\nmillion term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of\n3.7\n% with a maturity date of November 14, 2035. Principal and interest payments are payable semiannually.\nExchangeable Notes\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06,\nDebt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity\n(“ASU 2020-06”), which reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and enhances transparency in disclosures. One model which was eliminated is the bifurcation of embedded conversion features that are not accounted for separately as derivatives. Each of the 2024 Exchangeable Notes, 2025 Exchangeable Notes, 2027 1.125% Exchangeable Notes and 2027 2.5% Exchangeable Notes\nF-25\n(as defined below) contain conversion options that may be settled with NCLH’s ordinary shares. As the options are both indexed to and settled in our ordinary shares, they are not accounted for separately as derivatives. The Private Exchangeable Notes contained a beneficial conversion feature, which was recognized within additional paid-in capital with an offsetting discount to the carrying amount of the debt. The discount was amortized to interest expense through December 31, 2020. On January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using a modified retrospective approach. As a result, the $\n131.2\nmillion beneficial conversion feature previously recognized was reclassified from additional paid-in capital to long-term debt, and the discount amortization of $\n5.6\nmillion was adjusted through accumulated deficit.\nAs of December 31, 2023, NCLC had outstanding $\n146.6\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n6.00\n% exchangeable senior notes due May 15, 2024 (the “2024 Exchangeable Notes”). The 2024 Exchangeable Notes are guaranteed by NCLH on a senior basis. Holders may exchange their 2024 Exchangeable Notes at their option into redeemable preference shares of NCLC. Upon exchange, the preference shares will be immediately and automatically exchanged, for each $\n1,000\nprincipal amount of exchanged 2024 Exchangeable Notes, into a number of NCLH’s ordinary shares based on the exchange rate. The exchange rate will initially be\n72.7273\nordinary shares per $\n1,000\nprincipal amount of 2024 Exchangeable Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $\n13.75\nper ordinary share). The maximum exchange rate is\n89.4454\nand reflects potential adjustments to the initial exchange rate, which would only be made in the event of certain make-whole fundamental changes or tax redemption events.  The exchange rate referred to above is also subject to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction. The 2024 Exchangeable Notes pay interest at\n6.00\n% per annum, semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, to holders of record at the close of business on the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1, respectively.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2023, NCLC had outstanding $\n450.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n5.375\n% exchangeable senior notes due August 1, 2025 (the “2025 Exchangeable Notes”). The 2025 Exchangeable Notes are guaranteed by NCLH on a senior basis. Holders may exchange their 2025 Exchangeable Notes at their option into redeemable preference shares of NCLC. Upon exchange, the preference shares will be immediately and automatically exchanged, for each $\n1,000\nprincipal amount of exchanged 2025 Exchangeable Notes, into a number of NCLH’s ordinary shares based on the exchange rate. The exchange rate will initially be\n53.3333\nordinary shares per $\n1,000\nprincipal amount of 2025 Exchangeable Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $\n18.75\nper ordinary share). The maximum exchange rate is\n66.6666\nand reflects potential adjustments to the initial exchange rate, which would only be made in the event of certain make-whole fundamental changes or tax redemption events.  The exchange rate referred to above is also subject to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction. The 2025 Exchangeable Notes pay interest at\n5.375\n% per annum, semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, to holders of record at the close of business on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, NCLC had outstanding $\n1,150.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n1.125\n% exchangeable senior notes due February 15, 2027 (the “2027 1.125% Exchangeable Notes”). The 2027 1.125% Exchangeable Notes are guaranteed by NCLH on a senior basis. Holders may exchange their 2027 1.125% Exchangeable Notes for, at the election of NCLC, cash, ordinary shares of NCLH or a combination of cash and ordinary shares of NCLH, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2026, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and on or after August 15, 2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, regardless of whether such conditions have been met. Upon exchange, the preference shares will be immediately and automatically exchanged, for each $\n1,000\nprincipal amount of exchanged 2027 1.125% Exchangeable Notes, into a number of NCLH’s ordinary shares based on the exchange rate. The initial exchange rate is\n29.6850\nordinary shares per $\n1,000\nprincipal amount of 2027 1.125% Exchangeable Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $\n33.69\nper ordinary share). The maximum exchange rate is\n42.3012\nand reflects potential adjustments to the initial exchange rate, which would only be made in the event of certain make-whole fundamental changes or tax redemption events.  The exchange rate referred to above is also subject to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction. The 2027 1.125% Exchangeable Notes pay interest at 1.125% per annum, semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, to holders of record at the close of business on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, NCLC had outstanding $\n473.2\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of\n2.5\n% exchangeable senior notes due February 15, 2027 (the “2027 2.5% Exchangeable Notes”). The 2027 2.5% Exchangeable Notes are guaranteed by NCLH on a senior basis. At their option, holders may exchange their 2027 2.5% Exchangeable Notes for,\nF-26\nat the election of NCLC, cash, ordinary shares of NCLH or a combination of cash and ordinary shares of NCLH, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2026, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and on or after August 15, 2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, regardless of whether such conditions have been met. If NCLC elects to satisfy its exchange obligation solely in ordinary shares or in a combination of ordinary shares and cash, upon exchange, the 2027 2.5% Exchangeable Notes will convert into redeemable preference shares of NCLC, which will be immediately and automatically exchanged, for each $\n1,000\nprincipal amount of exchanged 2027 2.5% Exchangeable Notes, into a number of NCLH’s ordinary shares based on the exchange rate. The exchange rate initially will be\n28.9765\nordinary shares per $\n1,000\nprincipal amount of 2027 2.5% Exchangeable Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $\n34.51\nper ordinary share). The maximum exchange rate is\n44.1891\nand reflects potential adjustments to the initial exchange rate, which would only be made in the event of certain make-whole fundamental changes or tax redemption events.  The exchange rate referred to above is also subject to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction. The 2027 2.5% Exchangeable Notes pay interest at\n2.5\n% per annum, semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, to holders of record at the close of business on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1, respectively.\nThe following is a summary of NCLC’s exchangeable notes as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n​\nThe following is a summary of NCLC’s exchangeable notes as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\n​\nThe following provides a summary of the interest expense recognized related to the exchangeable notes (in thousands):\n​\nThe effective interest rate is\n7.04\n%,\n5.97\n%,\n1.64\n% and\n3.06\n% for the 2024 Exchangeable Notes, 2025 Exchangeable Notes, 2027 1.125% Exchangeable Notes and 2027 2.5% Exchangeable Notes, respectively.\n​\n​\nF-27\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $\n727.5\nmillion which included $\n73.5\nmillion of amortization of deferred financing fees and an approximately $\n8.8\nmillion loss on extinguishment and modification of debt. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $\n801.5\nmillion which included $\n59.3\nmillion of amortization of deferred financing fees and a $\n193.4\nmillion loss on extinguishment of debt. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $\n2.1\nbillion which included $\n54.4\nmillion of amortization of deferred financing fees and a $\n1.4\nbillion loss on extinguishment and modification of debt.\nDebt Repayments\nThe following are scheduled principal repayments on our long-term debt including exchangeable notes which can be settled in shares and finance lease obligations as of December 31, 2023 for each of the next five years (in thousands):\n​\n​\nWe had an accrued interest liability of $\n195.2\nmillion and $\n151.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDebt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. If we do not continue to remain in compliance with our covenants, we would have to seek additional amendments to or waivers of our covenants. However, no assurances can be made that such amendments or waivers would be approved by our lenders. Generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default and/or cross acceleration clauses, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated, which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and liquidity.\nNCLC, as issuer, NCLH, as guarantor, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, were all parties to an indenture, dated May 28, 2020 (the “Indenture”) related to the Private Exchangeable Notes, which were held by an affiliate of L Catterton (the “Private Investor”). Based on the initial exchange rate for the Private Exchangeable Notes, the Private Investor beneficially owned approximately\n10\n% of NCLH’s outstanding ordinary shares as of December 31, 2020. The initial exchange rate for the Private Exchangeable Notes could have been adjusted in the event of certain make-whole fundamental changes or tax redemption events (each, as described in the Indenture), but the maximum number of NCLH ordinary shares issuable upon an exchange in the event of such an adjustment would not have exceeded\n46,577,947\n. The Private Exchangeable Notes also contained certain anti-dilution provisions that could have subjected the exchange rate to additional adjustment if certain events had occurred.\nNCLH, NCLC and the Private Investor also entered into an investor rights agreement, dated May 28, 2020 (the “Investor Rights Agreement”), which provided that, among other things, the Private Investor was entitled to nominate one person for appointment to the board of directors of NCLH until the first date on which the Private Investor no longer beneficially owned in the aggregate at least\n50\n% of the number of NCLH’s ordinary shares issuable upon exchange of the Private Exchangeable Notes beneficially owned by the Private Investor in the aggregate as of May 28, 2020 (subject to certain adjustments).\nF-28\nThe Investor Rights Agreement also provided for customary registration rights for the Private Investor and its affiliates, including demand and piggyback registration rights, contained customary transfer restrictions and provided that the Private Investor and its affiliates were subject to a voting agreement with respect to certain matters during a specified period of time.\nIn a privately negotiated transaction among NCLH, NCLC and the Private Investor, NCLC agreed to repurchase all of the outstanding Private Exchangeable Notes for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $\n1.0\nbillion (the “Repurchase”). On March 9, 2021, in connection with the settlement of the Repurchase, the trustee cancelled the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Private Exchangeable Notes and confirmed that NCLC had satisfied and discharged its obligations under the Indenture. In connection with the Repurchase, we and the Private Investor agreed to terminate the Investor Rights Agreement effective upon the consummation of the Repurchase. Notwithstanding the termination, we and the Private Investor agreed that certain provisions related to indemnification and expense reimbursement would survive in accordance with their terms.\n​\nFair value is defined as the price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability).\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe following hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement dates.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs that are used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available.\nDerivatives\nWe are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives. We assess whether derivatives used in hedging transactions are “highly effective” in offsetting changes in the cash flow of our hedged forecasted transactions. We use critical terms match or regression analysis for hedge relationships and high effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the fair values of the derivative and the hedged forecasted transaction. Cash flows from the derivatives are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged transaction. If it is determined that the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, then the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is released to earnings. There are no amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and there are no credit-risk-related contingent features in our derivative agreements. We monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. Credit risk, including but not limited to counterparty non-performance under derivatives, is not considered significant, as we primarily conduct business with large, well-established financial institutions with which we have established relationships, and which have credit risks acceptable to us, or the credit risk is spread out among many creditors. We do not anticipate non-performance by any of our significant counterparties.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had fuel swaps, which are used to mitigate the financial impact of volatility of fuel prices pertaining to approximately\n756\nthousand metric tons of our projected fuel purchases, maturing through\nDecember 31, 2025\n.\nF-29\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had fuel swaps pertaining to approximately\n26\nthousand metric tons of our projected fuel purchases which were not designated as cash flow hedges maturing through December 31, 2024.\nThe derivatives measured at fair value and the respective location in the consolidated balance sheets includes the following (in thousands):\n​\n​\nThe fair values of swap and forward contracts are determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets. The Company determines the value of options and collars utilizing an option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets. The option pricing model used by the Company is an industry standard model for valuing options and is used by the broker/dealer community. The inputs to this option pricing model are the option strike price, underlying price, risk-free rate of interest, time to expiration, and volatility. The fair value of option contracts considers both the intrinsic value and any remaining time value associated with those derivatives that have not yet settled. The Company also considers counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk in its determination of all estimated fair values.\nOur derivatives and financial instruments were categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, and we had no derivatives or financial instruments categorized as Level 1 or Level 3. Our derivative contracts include rights of offset with our counterparties. We have elected to net certain assets and liabilities within counterparties when the rights of offset exist. We are not required to post cash collateral related to our derivative instruments.\nF-30\nThe gross and net amounts recognized within assets and liabilities include the following (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\nThe effects of cash flow hedge accounting on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) include the following (in thousands):\n​\n​\nThe effects of cash flow hedge accounting on the consolidated statements of operations include the following (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\nF-31\nThe effects of cash flow hedge accounting on the consolidated statements of operations include the following (in thousands):\n​\n​\nThe effects of cash flow hedge accounting on the consolidated statements of operations include the following (in thousands):\n​\n​\nThe effects of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations include the following (in thousands):\n​\nLong-Term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $\n13.5\nbillion and $\n11.9\nbillion, respectively, which was $\n0.9\nbillion and $\n2.0\nbillion lower, respectively, than the carrying values, excluding deferred financing costs. The difference between the fair value and carrying value of our long-term debt is due\nF-32\nto our fixed and variable rate debt obligations carrying interest rates that are above or below market rates at the measurement dates. The fair value of our long-term revolving and term loan facilities was calculated based on estimated rates for the same or similar instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities. The fair value of our exchangeable notes considers observable risk-free rates; credit spreads of the same or similar instruments; and share prices, tenors, and historical and implied volatilities which are sourced from observable market data. The inputs are considered to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Market risk associated with our long-term variable rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates or from an increase in share values.\nNon-Recurring Measurements of Non-Financial Assets\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived assets, principally trade names, are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nWe believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our long-lived assets, principally ships, and goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable. Nonetheless, if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. We estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. As of October 1, 2023, our annual review supports the carrying value of these assets.\nOther\nThe carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets of all other financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value.\nAmended and Restated 2013 Performance Incentive Plan\nIn January 2013, NCLH adopted the 2013 Performance Incentive Plan, which provided for the issuance of up to\n15,035,106\nof NCLH’s ordinary shares pursuant to awards granted under the plan, with no more than\n5,000,000\nshares being granted to one individual in any calendar year. In May 2016, May 2021 and June 2022, the plan was amended and restated (the “Restated 2013 Plan”) pursuant to approval from the Board of Directors and NCLH’s shareholders. Among other things, under the Restated 2013 Plan, the number of NCLH’s ordinary shares that may be delivered pursuant to all awards granted under the plan was increased to a new maximum aggregate limit of\n39,375,106\nshares. In June 2023, NCLH’s shareholders approved a further amendment and restatement of the Restated 2013 Plan to increase the number of NCLH ordinary shares that may be delivered by\n2,633,900\n, resulting in an increase in the maximum aggregate limit to\n42,009,006\nshares. Additionally, the expiration date of the Restated 2013 Plan was extended to February 20, 2033. Share options under the plan are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of NCLH shares at the date of grant.\nThe vesting period for time-based options is typically set at\nthree\nor\nfour\nyears with a contractual life of\n10 years\n. The vesting period for time-based and performance-based restricted share units is generally\nthree years\n. Forfeited awards will be available for subsequent awards under the Restated 2013 Plan.\n​\nF-33\nShare Option Awards\nThere were\nno\nshare option awards granted for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The following table sets forth a summary of option activity under NCLH’s Restated 2013 Plan for the period presented:\n​\n​\nThere were no share options exercised or cash received by the Company from exercises during 2023, 2022 or 2021. As of December 31, 2023, there was\nno\nunrecognized compensation cost, related to options granted under our share-based incentive plans.\nRestricted Share Unit (“RSU”) Awards\nIn March 2023, NCLH granted\n5.8\nmillion time-based RSU awards to our employees, which primarily vest in substantially equal installments over\nthree years\n. Also, in March 2023, NCLH granted\n0.8\nmillion performance-based RSU awards to certain members of our management team, which vest upon the achievement of certain pre-established performance targets established through 2025 and the satisfaction of an additional time-based vesting requirement that generally requires continued employment through March 1, 2026.\nThe fair value of the time-based and performance-based RSUs is equal to the closing market price of NCLH shares at the date of grant. The performance-based RSUs awarded to certain members of our management team are subject to performance conditions such that the number of shares that ultimately vest depends on the Adjusted EPS and booked position achieved by the Company during the performance period compared to targets established at the award date or other non-financial targets. Although the terms of the performance-based RSU awards provide the compensation committee with the discretion to make certain adjustments to the performance calculation, a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of these awards has been ascertained. The Company remeasures the probability and the cumulative share-based compensation expense of the awards each reporting period until vesting or forfeiture occurs.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of RSU activity for the period presented:\n​\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested time-based, non-vested performance-based and market-based RSUs of $\n89.3\nmillion, $\n12.1\nmillion and $\n0\n, respectively. The costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.8\nyears,\n1.6\nyears and\n0\nyears, respectively, for the time-based, performance-based and market-based RSUs. Taxes paid pursuant to net share settlements in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $\n26.9\nmillion, $\n21.0\nmillion and $\n16.7\nmillion, respectively.\nF-34\nThe compensation expense recognized for share-based compensation for the periods presented include the following (in thousands):\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe offer annual incentive bonuses pursuant to our Restated 2013 Plan for our executive officers and other key employees. Bonuses under the plan become earned and payable based on the Company’s performance during the applicable performance period and generally require the individual’s continued employment. Company performance criteria include the attainment of certain financial targets and other strategic objectives.\nCertain employees are employed pursuant to agreements that provide for severance payments. Severance is generally only payable upon an involuntary termination of the employment by us without cause or a termination by the employee for good reason. Severance generally includes a series of cash payments based on the employee’s base salary and our payment of the employee’s continued medical benefits for the applicable severance period.\nWe maintain a 401(k) Plan for our shoreside employees, including our executive officers. Participants may contribute up to\n100\n% of eligible compensation each pay period, subject to certain limitations. In 2022 and 2021, we made matching contributions equal to\n100\n% of the first\n3\n% and\n50\n% of amounts greater than\n3\n% to and including\n10\n% of each participant’s contributions subject to certain limitations. In addition, we may make discretionary supplemental contributions to the 401(k) Plan, which shall be allocated pro rata to each eligible participant based on the compensation of the participant relative to the total compensation of all participants. Our matching contributions are vested according to a\nfive-year\nschedule. In 2023, we temporarily paused our matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan, which we have reinstated for 2024. The 401(k) Plan is subject to the provisions of ERISA and is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). We recorded total expenses related to the above 401(k) Plan of $\n0.6\nmillion, $\n11.6\nmillion and $\n8.7\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEffective January 2009, we implemented the Shipboard Retirement Plan which computes benefits based on years of service, subject to eligibility requirements. The Shipboard Retirement Plan is unfunded with\nno\nplan assets. The current portion of the projected benefit obligation of $\n1.5\nmillion and $\n1.4\nmillion was included in accrued expenses and other liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $\n32.9\nmillion and $\n27.3\nmillion was included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n​\n​\nF-35\nThe amounts related to the Shipboard Retirement Plan were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\nThe discount rates used in the net periodic benefit cost calculation for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were\n5.3\n%,\n2.8\n% and\n2.3\n%, respectively, and the actuarial loss is amortized over\n18\nyears. The discount rate is used to measure and recognize obligations, including adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), and to determine expense during the periods. It is determined by using bond indices which reflect yields on a broad maturity and industry universe of high-quality corporate bonds.\nThe pension benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five years and in aggregate for the five years thereafter are as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\nWe are incorporated in Bermuda. Under prior Bermuda law, we were not subject to tax on income and capital gains. Previously, we received from the Minister of Finance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, an assurance that, in the event that Bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits, income, any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance, then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to us or to any of our operations or shares, debentures or other obligations, until March 31, 2035. Such assurances were superseded by the passage of new legislation as described below.\nF-36\nOn December 27, 2023, the Bermuda Act was enacted in Bermuda.  Under the Bermuda Act, the corporate income tax will be determined based on a statutory tax rate of 15% effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The corporate income tax will apply only to Bermuda tax resident businesses that are part of multinational enterprise groups with €750 million or more in annual revenues in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the year in question. Although the Government of Bermuda has already released limited guidance with respect to specific provisions of the Bermuda Act, it is anticipated that further administrative guidance as well as regulatory guidance will be released over the course of the 2024 calendar year and beyond.\nAs enacted, the Bermuda Act makes it clear that any corporate income tax liability is due regardless of the above assurances under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966. Therefore, we will be subject to the Bermuda corporate income tax with effect from January 1, 2025.\nThe Bermuda Act provides for an international shipping income exclusion.  In order for a Bermuda entity’s international shipping income to qualify for the exclusion, the entity must demonstrate that the strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned is effectively carried on from or within Bermuda. We expect we will meet the necessary requirements to qualify for the international shipping income exclusion during 2024.\nAdditionally, the Bermuda Act provides for companies to be able to offset 80% of their Bermuda taxable income with any available tax loss deductions on an annual basis. The Bermuda Act provides for opening tax loss carryforwards based on the Bermuda taxable income (loss) results of the individual Bermuda entities in the five fiscal years prior to the enactment date, which includes the 2020 through 2024 calendar years for NCLH.\nThe components of net income (loss) before income taxes consist of the following (in thousands):\n​\n​\nThe components of the provision for income taxes consisted of the following benefit (expense) (in thousands):\n​\n​\nF-37\nOur reconciliation of income tax expense computed by applying our Bermuda statutory rate and reported income tax benefit (expense) was as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nWe have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $\n845.5\nmillion and $\n721.3\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which begin to expire in\n2030\n, a portion of which relate to Prestige discussed further below. We have state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n32.1\nmillion and $\n24.8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which expire between\n2028\nthrough\n2043\n. As described above, as a result of the new corporate income tax legislation enacted in Bermuda on December 27, 2023, we have Bermuda opening tax loss carryforwards of $\n3.5\nbillion as of December 31, 2023, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The opening tax loss carryforwards will continue to be evaluated through the enactment date, January 1, 2025, and is subject to material change as this is an estimated amount. We evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods. We conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence. This evaluation considers, among other factors, historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for the cruise industry and broader economy. Based on the weight of available evidence, we have recorded a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2023, 2022 and 2021 of $\n2.3\nmillion, $\n43.3\nmillion and $\n45.0\nmillion, respectively, with respect to the U.S. net deferred tax assets in one of our U.S. and several of our foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, we have recorded a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $\n532.4\nmillion with respect to our Bermuda net deferred tax assets.\nIncluded above are deferred tax assets associated with our operations in Norway for which we have provided a full valuation allowance. We have Norway net operating loss carryforwards of $\n10.8\nmillion and $\n11.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which can be carried forward indefinitely.\nIncluded above are deferred tax assets associated with Prestige. We have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $\n155.0\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which begin to expire in\n2030\n. Utilization of the Prestige net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously and/or that could occur in the future, as provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Section 382”). Ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be\nF-38\nutilized to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. If we have experienced an ownership change, utilization of Prestige’s net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization. Subsequent ownership changes could further impact the limitation in future years. We implemented certain tax restructuring strategies that created our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of Prestige, for which we had previously provided a full valuation allowance.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. We are generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by authorities for years prior to 2020, except for years in which NOLs generated prior to 2020 are utilized.\nDue to our international structure as well as the existence of international tax treaties that exempt taxation on certain activities, the repatriation of earnings from our subsidiaries would have no tax impact.\nWe derive our income from the international operation of ships. We are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and receive income from sources within the U.S. Under Section 883, certain foreign corporations are exempt from U. S. federal income or branch profits tax on U.S.-source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of ships. Applicable U.S. treasury regulations provide that a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (i) the foreign country in which the corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption for income from the international operation of ships to corporations organized in the U.S., and (ii) the foreign corporation has one or more classes of stock that are “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the U.S. or another qualifying country. We believe that we qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because we are incorporated in qualifying countries and our ordinary shares are primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the U.S.\nShip Construction Contracts\nFor the Norwegian brand, we have\nfour\nPrima Class Ships on order, each ranging from approximately\n156,300\nto\n169,000\nGross Tons with\n3,550\nto\n3,850\nBerths, with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028.\nFor the Oceania Cruises brand, we have an order for\none\nAllura Class Ship to be delivered in 2025. The Allura Class Ship will be approximately\n67,800\nGross Tons and\n1,250\nBerths.\nThe impacts of initiatives to improve environmental sustainability, modifications the Company has made to its newbuilds and/or other macroeconomic conditions and events have resulted in delays in expected ship deliveries in the past. These and other impacts could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future, which may be prolonged.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2023, the combined contract prices, including amendments and change orders, of the\nfive\nships on order for delivery was approximately €\n5.8\nbillion, or $\n6.4\nbillion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2023. We have obtained fixed-rate export-credit backed financing for the ships on order which is expected to fund approximately\n80\n% of each contract price, subject to certain conditions. We do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur. However, if any such events were to occur, it could result in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nF-39\nAs of December 31, 2023, minimum annual payments for non-cancelable ship construction contracts with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nPort Facility Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2023, future commitments to pay for usage of certain port facilities were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nOther Commitments\nThe FMC requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify passengers in the event of non-performance of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our\nthree\nbrands is required to maintain a $\n32.0\nmillion third-party performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to passengers. The guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments.\nIn addition, our brands have a legal requirement to maintain security guarantees based on cruise business originated from the U.K., and we are required to establish financial responsibility by certain jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2023, we have in place approximately £\n62.4\nmillion of security guarantees for our brands as well as a consumer protection policy covering up to £\n107.9\nmillion. The Company has provided approximately $\n1.5\nmillion in cash to secure all the financial security guarantees required.\nFrom time to time, various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the U.S. and the cruise industry in general.\nLitigation\nInvestigations\nIn March 2020, the Florida Attorney General announced an investigation related to the Company’s marketing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the announcement of the investigation by the Florida Attorney General, we received notifications from other attorneys general and governmental agencies that they are conducting similar investigations. The Company is cooperating with these ongoing investigations, the outcomes of which cannot be predicted at this time.\n​\nF-40\nHelms-Burton Act\nOn August 27, 2019,\na\nlawsuit was filed against Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The complaint, filed by Havana Docks Corporation (the “Havana Docks Matter”), alleges it holds an interest in the Havana Cruise Port Terminal, which was expropriated by the Cuban Government. The complaint further alleges that the Company “trafficked” in the property by embarking and disembarking passengers at the facility, as well as profiting from the Cuban Government’s possession of the property. The plaintiff seeks all available statutory remedies, including the value of the expropriated property, plus interest, treble damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. After various motions challenging the sufficiency of plaintiff’s complaint were resolved and voluminous discovery was completed, both sides filed motions for summary judgment. On March 21, 2022, the court issued an order granting plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability and denying the Company’s cross-motion for summary judgment. The court scheduled a trial on determination of damages only for November 2022. The plaintiff elected to seek what the court ruled to be its baseline statutory damage amount, which was the amount of the certified claim plus interest, trebled and with attorneys’ fees. Given this, there was no fact issue to be tried, and the matter was removed from the trial calendar. On December 30, 2022, the court entered a final judgment of approximately $\n112.9\nmillion and, on January 23, 2023, the Company filed a notice of appeal from that judgment. On April 12, 2023, the Company posted a sufficient supersedeas bond with the court to prevent any efforts by the plaintiff to collect on the judgment pending the appeal. On June 30, 2023, the Company filed its opening appellate brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On September 29, 2023, the plaintiff filed its answering brief responding to the Company’s opening brief in the Eleventh Circuit. We believe that the likelihood of loss related to this matter is reasonably possible but not probable at this time; therefore, no liability has been recorded. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things: lack of legal precedent, stage of the proceedings, legal uncertainties inherent within the litigation process, the availability of appellate remedies, and involvement of numerous parties.  We continue to believe we have meritorious defenses to the Havana Docks Matter.  However, if the plaintiff prevails in the final outcome of this matter, there may be a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n​\nOther\n​\nWe were a party to a claim against a vendor which resulted in a verdict of approximately $\n159\nmillion in favor of the Company in October 2022, for which the vendor filed a notice of appeal in February 2023. In December 2023, the Company and the vendor agreed to settle the claim and entered into a new comprehensive services arrangement with preferred rates. The favorable financial impact of these preferred rates will be recognized during the term of the 10-year arrangement as the services are provided.\nIn the normal course of our business, various other claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us. Most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and, accordingly, the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount. Nonetheless, the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time. We have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all of our threatened and pending litigation and, to the extent required, we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses associated with our deemed exposure. We are currently unable to estimate any other potential losses beyond those accrued, as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery. However, based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that the aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these matters will be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We intend to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and, to the extent necessary, seek recovery.\nOther Contingencies\nThe Company also has agreements with its credit card processors that govern approximately $\n2.9\nbillion in advance ticket sales as of December 31, 2023 that have been received by the Company relating to future voyages. These agreements allow the credit card processors to require under certain circumstances, including the existence of a material adverse change, excessive chargebacks and other triggering events, that the Company maintain a reserve which would be satisfied by posting collateral. Although the agreements vary, these requirements may generally be satisfied either\nF-41\nthrough a percentage of customer payments withheld or providing cash funds directly to the card processor. Any cash reserve or collateral requested could be increased or decreased. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash reserves with credit card processors of approximately $\n51.6\nmillion, which includes $\n20.1\nmillion recognized in accounts receivable, net and $\n31.5\nmillion recognized in other long-term assets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received a return of cash collateral from one credit card processor of $\n500\nmillion, which was previously classified as other long-term assets. We may be required to pledge additional collateral and/or post additional cash reserves or take other actions in the future that may adversely affect our liquidity.\nOther income (expense), net was expense of $\n40.2\nmillion, income of $\n76.6\nmillion, and income of $\n124.0\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2023, the expense was primarily due to net losses from foreign currency remeasurements. In 2022 and 2021, the income was primarily due to gains\non derivatives not designated as hedges and gains from foreign currency remeasurements.\nWe contract with a single vendor to provide many of our hotel and restaurant services including both food and labor costs. We incurred expenses of $\n203.7\nmillion, $\n162.2\nmillion and $\n48.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are recorded in payroll and related in our consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had non-cash investing activities related to property and equipment of $\n37.7\nmillion. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we received a refund of income taxes of $\n3.1\nmillion and paid interest and related fees, net of capitalized interest, of $\n822.5\nmillion including the early redemption premiums.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had non-cash investing activities related to property and equipment of $\n51.7\nmillion.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received a refund of income taxes of $\n9.5\nmillion and paid interest and related fees, net of capitalized interest, of $\n750.6\nmillion including the early redemption premiums.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had non-cash investing activities in connection with property and equipment of $\n109.3\nmillion. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid income taxes of $\n2.7\nmillion and interest and related fees, net of capitalized interest, of $\n2.1\nbillion.\n​\n​\n​\n​\nF-42"
