    "text": "You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nThe cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results.\nOur business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply-demand balance in the chemical and refining industries. Our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility. The chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages, causing prices and profit margins to increase, followed by periods of excess capacity, resulting in oversupply, declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins.\nIn addition to changes in the supply and demand for products, changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility. These factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles.\n21\nNew capacity additions around the world may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability. The timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time. As a consequence, we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA sustained decrease in the price of crude oil may adversely impact the results of our operations, primarily in North America.\nEnergy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas. These price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical. In the past, raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations. For example, we have benefited from the favorable ratio of U.S. crude oil prices to natural gas prices in the past. If the price of crude oil remains lower relative to U.S. natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and NGLs increases, this may have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nCosts and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses.\nThe costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers. When we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases, we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations. For example, during 2022, increases in costs for energy and raw materials, and the related decline in demand for our products, resulted in the reduction of operating rates or delayed restart of operations at several of our sites in Europe.\nCost increases for raw materials, energy, or broad-based price inflation also increase working capital needs, which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow. Even if we are able to increase our sales prices to reflect these increases, demand for products may decrease as consumers and customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, producers in natural gas cost-advantaged regions, such as the Middle East and North America, benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and NGLs. Competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from Europe and elsewhere. Any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within Europe and other markets, which can result in lower margins in those regions.\nFor some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located. It is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole, dedicated source for its utilities, such as steam, electricity and gas. Having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power, particularly in the case of rising raw material costs. Any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements.\nAdditionally, there is concern over the reliability of water sources, including around the U.S. Gulf Coast where several of our facilities are located. The decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth, drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations, including by impacting our ability to produce or transport our products.\nIf our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted, our businesses would likely incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime, which would have a negative impact on plant operations. Disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues resulting from natural disasters, water levels, and interruptions in marine water routes, among other causes, that can affect the operations of vessels, barges, rails, trucks and pipeline traffic. These risks are particularly prevalent in the U.S. Gulf Coast area. Additionally, increasing exports of NGLs and crude oil from the U.S. or greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could restrict the availability of our raw materials, thereby increasing our costs.\nWith increased volatility in raw material costs, our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us, resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements.\n22\nOur ability to source raw materials or deliver products may be adversely affected by political instability, civil disturbances or other governmental actions.\nWe obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from sources in the Middle East and Central and South America that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business. Political instability, civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are more likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations or impair our ability to deliver products to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIncidents of civil unrest, including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence, have occurred in a number of countries, including in the Middle East and South America. Some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. Political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas. Such unrest, if it continues to spread or grow in intensity, could lead to civil wars, regional conflicts or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business, such as in the U.S., Europe or their respective trading partners.\nOur business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs. Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy. Moreover, interest payments, dividends, capital requirements of our joint ventures, the expansion of our current business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. If we need external financing, our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally. There can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may use our $3,250 million revolving credit facility, which backs our commercial paper program, to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. As of December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $3,250 million. We may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our $900 million U.S. Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2023, we had no borrowing or letters of credit outstanding and availability of $900 million under this facility. In the event of a default under our credit facilities or any of our senior notes, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate.\n23\nRisks Related to our Operations\nOur operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses, and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated.\nWe maintain property, business interruption, product, general liability, casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are appropriate for our business and operations as well as in line with industry practices. However, we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business, including losses resulting from natural disasters or climate-related exposures, wars or terrorist acts. Changes in insurance market conditions have caused, and may in the future cause, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and, in some instances, for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations.\nOur business, including our results of operations and reputation, could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues.\nFailure to appropriately manage occupational safety, process safety, product safety, human health, product liability and environmental risks inherent in the chemical and refining businesses and associated with our products, product life cycles and production processes could result in unexpected incidents including releases, fires, or explosions resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenue, legal liability, and/or operational disruption. Public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate. While we have management systems, procedures and controls to manage these risks, issues could be created by events outside of our control, including natural disasters, severe weather events and acts of sabotage.\nFurther, because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology, our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins. Hazardous incidents involving our licensees, if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies, may harm our reputation, threaten our relationships with other licensees and/or lead to customer attrition and financial losses. Our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective. As a result, our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected, and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage.\nInterruptions of operations at our facilities may result in increased liabilities or lower operating results.\nWe own and operate large-scale facilities. Our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule. Interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our business as a whole, during and after the period of such operational difficulties. In recent years, we have had to shut down plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, including the temporary shutdown of a portion of our Houston refinery, as a result of various hurricanes and cold weather events striking Texas and Louisiana. In addition, because the Houston refinery is our only refining operation, an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results as we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. These potential hazards include:\n•\npipeline leaks and ruptures;\n•\nexplosions;\n•\nfires;\n24\n•\nsevere weather and natural disasters;\n•\nmechanical failure;\n•\nunscheduled downtimes;\n•\nsupplier disruptions;\n•\nlabor shortages or other labor difficulties;\n•\ntransportation interruptions;\n•\nremediation complications;\n•\nincreased restrictions on, or the unavailability of, water for use at our manufacturing sites or for the transport of our products or raw materials;\n•\nchemical and oil spills;\n•\ndischarges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases;\n•\nshipment of incorrect or off-specification product to customers;\n•\nstorage tank leaks;\n•\nother environmental risks; and\n•\ncyber-attack or other terrorist acts.\nSome of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, legal liability resulting from government action or litigation, loss of revenue, suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities.\nLarge capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting project returns. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nDelays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results, or impair our ability to meet our sustainability or other targets or goals. For example, higher costs arising from delaying construction of our world-scale PO/TBA plant in Houston including more extensive civil construction and unexpected tariffs on materials, increased our costs and impacted our projected rate of return on the project. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to contract with our customers and supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n•\ndenial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;\n•\nunplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;\n•\ndisruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;\n•\nadverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;\n•\nshortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; and\n•\nnonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.\n25\nAny one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. If we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nShared control or lack of control of joint ventures or equity investments may delay decisions or actions regarding our joint ventures, or adversely affect our financial results.\nA portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures or equity investments, where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties. We cannot control the actions or ownership of these partners, including any nonperformance, default or bankruptcy of the joint venture or its partners. The joint ventures that we do not control may also lack financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes.\nOur joint venture partners may have different interests or goals than we do and may take actions contrary to our requests, policies or objectives. Differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters, potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations. We may develop a dispute with any of our partners over decisions affecting the venture that may result in litigation, arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution. If a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest, or is unsuccessful in conducting its business, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events including impairments of our assets.\nWe may be required to reduce production or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry. Specifically, oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production. We may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have off-take arrangements at other facilities, which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we identified an impairment trigger related to the adverse financial performance of our European PO joint venture which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $192 million.\nAny decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business may result in impairment and other charges to earnings. For example, in April 2022, the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to exit the refining business, resulting in the recognition of $334 million and $187 million of expense in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTemporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer. These outages could cause us to incur significant costs, including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities. In addition, we have significant obligations under take-or-pay agreements. Even though we may reduce production at facilities, we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under these arrangements.\nAcquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price.\nWe continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of all of our businesses and evaluate whether our businesses would benefit from acquisitions to enhance growth or dispositions that would align our footprint with our overall business strategy. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements.\n26\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including meeting our standards for compliance, problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs and liabilities, diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses, and potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire. The integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues, synergies, or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we do not manage and operate the acquired business up to our expectations. If we are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls, and human resources practices, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nDispositions of assets or businesses involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business. In addition, they may result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In the event we are unable to successfully divest a business or product line, we may be forced to wind down such business or product line, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in acquiring or divesting a business or product line, and any transaction we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may also result in a diversion of management attention, operational difficulties and losses.\nRisks related to the Global Economy and Multinational Operations\nEconomic disruptions and downturns in general, and particularly continued global economic uncertainty or economic turmoil in emerging markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally. Economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products could substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk. Recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced, particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically, and may result in higher costs of capital. A significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in Europe. In addition, most of our European transactions and assets, including cash and receivables, are denominated in euros.\nWe also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets, particularly the emerging markets in Asia and South America. Any broad-based downturn in these emerging markets, or in a key market such as China, could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets. Any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures.\nWe sell our products in highly competitive global markets. Due to the commodity nature of many of our products, competition in these markets is based primarily on price and, to a lesser extent, on product performance, product quality, product deliverability, reliability of supply and customer service. Often, we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business.\n27\nIn addition, we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us. These include large integrated oil companies (some of which also have chemical businesses), government-owned businesses, and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region. Continuing competition from these companies, especially in our olefin and refining businesses, could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases, or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively, which would reduce our profitability. Competitors with different cost structures or strategic goals than we have may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. In addition, specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time. Increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, exchange controls, political risks and other risks relating to international operations.\nWe operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level. These risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, economic instability and disruptions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of trade restrictions or duties and tariffs, and complex regulations concerning privacy and data security. Additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions, war, terrorist activities, epidemics, pandemics, political instability, import and export controls, sanctions, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments.\nWe generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency. Exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. It is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results. Additionally, we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed, including the United Kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend payments. It is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes, including withholding taxes.\nOur operating results could be negatively affected by the laws, rules and regulations, as well as political environments, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. There could be reduced demand for our products, decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations. Trade protection measures such as quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures or anti-dumping duties imposed in the countries in which we operate could negatively impact our business. Additionally, there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations and/or increased security costs or insurance premiums, any of which could reduce our operating results.\nWe obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks. Our compliance with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged. Furthermore, these laws may be modified, the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us.\nFurthermore, we are subject to certain existing, and may be subject to possible future, laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws, which may adversely affect our competitiveness.\n28\nChanges in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations.\nThe Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex legal and tax regulatory environments and is subject to taxes in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant changes to tax laws and regulations in these jurisdictions or their interpretation could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate. Our future effective income tax rates could also fluctuate based on, among other factors, changes in pre-tax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates, changes in valuation allowances, changes in foreign exchange gains/losses, the amount of exempt income, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. Our tax returns are periodically audited or subjected to review by tax authorities, and any adverse result of these examinations could also have an impact on our effective income tax rate and our results of operations. We regularly evaluate the likelihood of an adverse result of an examination, however, there is no assurance as to the ultimate outcome and impact.\nRisks Related to Health, Safety, and the Environment\nWe cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations, and cannot guarantee they will not be material.\nWe may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities, or exposure to products or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. In addition, because our products are components of a variety of other end-use products, we, along with other members of the chemical industry, are subject to potential claims related to those end-use products. Any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive national, regional, state and local environmental laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning pollution, protection of the environment, hazardous materials, health and safety, the security of our facilities, and the safety of our products. We generally expect that these requirements are likely to become more stringent over time. Changes to such laws could result in restrictions on our operations, denial of permits, loss of business opportunities, increased operating costs or additional capital expenditures. We could incur significant costs or operational restrictions due to violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations in the form of fines, penalties, and injunctive relief. Any substantial liability under such laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations. These permits and licenses are subject to renewal, modification and in some circumstances, revocation. Further, the permits and licenses are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.\nWe may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives.\nThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated international, national and state laws focusing on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission reduction and global climate change. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws and regulations in this field continue to evolve and, while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent, at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to undertake ambitious efforts to reduce GHG emissions and strengthen adaptation to the effects of climate change.\n29\nJurisdictions in which we operate, including, in particular, the European Union (EU), are preparing national legislation and protection plans to implement their emission reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement. In June 2021, the European Climate Law set legally binding targets of net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. Throughout 2023, a series of legislative reforms arising out of the EU’s ‘Fit for 55’ package of proposals have been adopted and are in the process of being implemented, including reforms to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Our operations in Europe participate in the ETS and we meet our obligations through a combination of free and purchased emission allowances. We anticipate that these regulations will result in an accelerated reduction of our free allowances and higher market prices for purchased allowances. These and other future regulations could result in increased costs, additional capital expenditures, and/or restrictions on operations.\nIn the U.S., addressing climate change is a stated priority of President Biden, and in February 2021, the U.S. recommitted to the Paris Agreement after having withdrawn in August 2017. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as well as several state governments have promulgated regulations directed at GHG emissions reductions from certain types of facilities. Additional regulations could be forthcoming at the U.S. federal or state level that could result in increased operating costs for compliance, required acquisition or trading of emission allowances, or compliance costs associated with additional regulatory frameworks for a range of potential carbon reduction projects, including carbon capture, use, and sequestration projects. Additionally, demand for the products we produce may be reduced.\nNon-Governmental Organizations have been active in filing lawsuits against governments and private parties in various jurisdictions around the world seeking enforcement of existing laws and new requirements to reduce GHG emissions. In one case decided in the Netherlands in May 2021, plaintiffs obtained a ruling ordering Royal Dutch Shell to reduce its Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions by 45% by 2030. These types of laws, regulations, and litigation results could increase the cost of purchased energy and increase costs of compliance in various locations.\nCompliance with climate regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans. Difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth. In addition, any future potential climate regulations, legislation, or litigation results could impose additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments, require us to incur increased costs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nLegislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products or reputational harm.\nNew or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health, safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products. Initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially result in increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. New or revised legislation or regulations could result in additional use restrictions and/or bans of certain chemicals. For example, in the EU, the European Commission as part of its Green Deal published the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability Towards a Toxic-Free Environment (“CSS”). The CSS sets forth far-reaching plans for introducing significant changes to the EU regulatory frameworks for chemicals including the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”), and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (“CLP”) that could result in increased compliance costs, additional restrictions, and/or bans of chemicals used or produced by us. In the U.S., changes to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s risk evaluation process under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) could also result in additional restrictions and/or bans of chemicals used or produced by us.\nAssessments under TSCA, REACH or similar programs or regulations in other state or national jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements or bans being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of those chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n30\nU.S. state and federal regulators, international regulators, investors, consumers and other stakeholders are focused on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) considerations. ESG disclosure obligations have required and may continue to require us to implement new practices and reporting processes, and have created and will continue to create additional compliance risk. If we are unable to meet our circularity, greenhouse gas reduction, diversity or other goals, or if we are perceived by regulators, customers, stockholders or employees to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for these issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell our products, could be negatively impacted. If, as a result of their assessment of our ESG performance, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our shares or debt securities. Providers of debt and equity financing may also consider our sustainability performance and external ESG ratings, which we have limited ability to influence, which could impact our cost of capital and adversely affect our business.\nThe physical impacts of climate change can negatively impact our facilities and operations.\nPotential physical impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity of hurricanes and floods as well as freezing conditions, tornadoes, and global sea level rise. Although we have preparedness plans in place designed to minimize impacts and enhance safety, should an event occur, it could have the potential to disrupt our supply chain and operations. A number of our facilities are located on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which has been impacted by hurricanes that have required us to temporarily shut down operations at those sites. Our sites rely on rivers and other waterways for transportation that may experience restrictions in times of drought or other unseasonal weather variation. In addition, scarcity of water and drought conditions due to climate change could reduce the availability of fresh water needed to produce our products which could increase our costs of operations.\nIncreased regulation or deselection of plastic could lead to a decrease in demand growth for some of our products.\nThere is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic, plastic additives, and microplastics in the environment, particularly in waterways and oceans. Additionally, plastics have recently faced increased public backlash and scrutiny, as well as governmental investigations and enforcement, and private litigation. Policy measures to address this concern are being discussed or implemented by governments at all levels. For example, on March 2, 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly adopted a resolution to develop a new international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution with the ambition to complete the negotiations by the end of 2024. The European Union has been undertaking a series of actions under its Circular Economy Action Plan, including adoption of the Single Use Plastics Directive in 2019, which introduced policy measures for single use plastics including bans, product design requirements, extended producer responsibility obligations, and labeling requirements, and a proposal for a Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation to replace the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. In addition, a host of single-use plastic bans and taxes have been passed by countries around the world and states and municipalities throughout the U.S. Consumer deselection, increased regulation of, or prohibition on, the manufacturing or use of plastic or plastic products could limit the use of these products or increase the costs incurred by our customers to use such products, and could lead to a decrease in demand for PE, PP, and other products we make. Such a decrease in demand could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFailure to effectively and timely achieve our GHG emissions reduction goals could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on the demand for our products.\nWe have set GHG emissions reduction targets for 2030, and aim to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050. Our ability to achieve these goals depends on many factors, including the availability of technology, our ability to secure permits and emissions credits, evolving regulatory requirements, competitor actions, customer preferences, and our ability to reduce emissions from our operations through modernization and innovation, reduce the emissions intensity of the electricity we buy, and invest in renewables and low carbon energy. We may also not timely adapt to changes or methods in carbon pricing that could increase our costs and reduce our competitiveness. The cost associated with our GHG emissions reduction goals could be significant. Failure to achieve our emissions targets could result in reputational harm, enforcement or litigation, changing investor sentiment regarding investment in LyondellBasell or a negative impact on access to and cost of capital. In addition, if customers increasingly set their own scope 3 GHG emissions reduction targets, this could lead to a decrease in demand for our products.\n31\nFailure to achieve our circularity goals could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products.\nIn September 2020, we announced a circularity goal of producing and marketing at least two million metric tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers annually by 2030. Many of our customers also have goals to increase the recycled and renewable content in their own products and packaging. Our ability to achieve this goal depends on many factors, including the availability of collection and sortation infrastructure, evolving regulations on chemical recycling and recycled content, our ability to grow our circular and low carbon solutions business established in 2022, make investments in new technologies, expand the global footprint of our recycling facilities and joint ventures, secure access to feedstock, and manufacture recycled and low carbon products at commercial scale.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIncreased IT and cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, data, products, facilities and services.\nIncreased global information cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated, targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, operations and infrastructure. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including security measures, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our employees, systems, networks, products, facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to ransomware or sophisticated espionage. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nMany of our businesses depend on our intellectual property. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and protect our intellectual property rights, and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins.\nWe have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents and our future results could be impacted by our ability to successfully develop and protect new processes and technologies. Our patents and patent applications, together with proprietary technical know-how, are significant to our competitive position, particularly with regard to PO, intermediate chemicals, polyolefins, licensing and catalysts. We rely on the patent, copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. We operate plants, sell catalysts and products, participate in joint ventures, and license our process technology in many foreign jurisdictions, including those having heightened risks for intellectual property. In some of these instances, we must disclose at least a portion of our technology to third parties or regulatory bodies. In these cases, we rely primarily on contracts and trade secret laws to protect the associated trade secrets. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization. Proceedings to protect these rights could be costly, and we may not prevail.\nThe failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins and cash flows and/or loss of market share. We also may be subject to claims that our technology, patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights. Unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us.\n32\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. We may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters.\nIf we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, and we rely heavily on our management team. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.\nThere is substantial and continuous competition for diverse, talented engineering, manufacturing, and operations employees. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel, and we may experience increased compensation and training costs that may not be offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We have from time to time experienced, and we may continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all.\nSignificant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans, and our pension cost.\nOur pension cost is materially affected by the discount rates used to measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets, particularly equity securities, or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. Any changes in key actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate or mortality rate, would impact the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years.\nMany of our current pension plans have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate deficit was $853 million. Any declines in the fair values of the pension plans’ assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels.\nOur pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions, which could include, under certain circumstances, local governmental authority to terminate the plan.\nSee Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pensions and other post-retirement benefits."

We have implemented comprehensive practices to minimize these risks. Our cybersecurity program is certified to the International Organization for Standardization ISO 27001, a standard for information security management, which covers key areas of management, technical and physical controls, legal, compliance and business continuity management.\nOur management utilizes a systematic approach to evaluating and determining risk tolerance and prioritizes the safeguarding of our digital assets. The Vice President of Cybersecurity leads our cybersecurity program and reports to the Executive Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer, who serves on the Executive Committee and reports to the CEO. The Vice President of Cybersecurity has a Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity Operations, is certified as an information security professional with the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2) and International Association of Privacy Professionals, and has over thirty years of leadership experience in technology, systems architecture, and cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity events are continuously monitored by global security operations centers staffed in the United States, European Union, and Asia Pacific regions with events and incidents being managed based upon the MITRE ATT&CK framework, a system for classifying and describing cyber attacks and intrusions. Management provides guidance and is informed of cybersecurity events through a committee with cross-functional representation of executive leadership. The committee meets at least quarterly for activities such as determining policy, reviewing active risks, assessing impact of emerging threats or regulatory changes, and monitoring active incidents. This committee also receives escalated alerts within 24-hours of confirmed cybersecurity events, and will determine the severity of the incident, engage with crisis management as necessary, and disseminate that information internally as appropriate and warranted.\nThird-party service providers must meet baseline security requirements before they connect to our systems or manage sensitive information. They are evaluated based on risk, which is based on financial, operational, legal/regulatory, capacity, cybersecurity posture, and reputational impact. Additionally, high risk third-party service providers are continuously monitored for security health and active threats.\nWe recognize the risk posed by global cybersecurity threats, and our Board is regularly updated on emerging risks and maintains oversight of our cybersecurity program implemented to address them. In 2023, the Board conducted its annual comprehensive review of specific cybersecurity and process control topics at its September meeting. Cybersecurity risk evaluation is integrated into our enterprise risk management processes and is presented to management and the board as a part of that process.\nWhile management is responsible for assessing and managing our day-to-day risks and control systems, the Audit Committee of the Board oversees our information technology and cybersecurity risks. The Committee conducts a comprehensive review of cybersecurity topics and reviews our programs and practices with management at least annually, and receives management’s report on our cybersecurity dashboard, which summarizes key security metrics and activities, at each quarterly Committee meeting.\nTo further advance cybersecurity awareness, we are developing solutions to mitigate the impact of third-party fraudulent cyber activity, including public facing portals for potential and current partners with capability to report suspected phishing.\nOur cybersecurity program includes, but is not limited to:\n•\nannual cybersecurity education for all company computer users on relevant policies and standards, best practices at work and at home;\n•\ncommunication processes including how to identify, respond, and report threats or potential vulnerabilities;\n34\n•\nprotective software installed and configured on Company systems and mobile devices, updated and patched on a regular basis, to provide the highest level of protection against malicious threats;\n•\nan established program based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework for dealing with ransomware and other cybersecurity incidents;\n•\nregular technical risk assessments of our network, applications and manufacturing facilities, using a combination of trusted suppliers and a dedicated, objective team;\n•\npenetration, discovery and vulnerability assessments conducted daily;\n•\nmobile threat protection mechanisms and policies;\n•\nbusiness continuity plans that are well documented and tested regularly; disaster recovery plans that are also well documented and tested at least annually; and\n•\ncoverage for non-damage business interruption or liability for data breaches as a part of the Company’s combined insurance programs.\nIn addition, in 2023, management conducted ransomware simulation exercises and engaged outside consultants to perform external perimeter penetration testing.\nWhile we attempt to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of measures, as described above, our employees, systems, networks, products, facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to ransomware or sophisticated espionage. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations or financial condition. No risks from cybersecurity threats, including those resulting from any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition."

    "text": "GENERAL\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report. Unless otherwise indicated, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar words are used to refer to LyondellBasell Industries N.V. together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“LyondellBasell N.V.”).\nEffective January 1, 2023, our\nCatalloy\nand polybutene-1 businesses were moved from the Advanced Polymer Solutions (“APS”) segment and reintegrated into the Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas (“O&P-Americas”) and Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International (“O&P-EAI”) segments. This move allows the APS team to focus on our compounding and solutions business, and to develop a more agile operating model with meaningful regional and segment growth strategies. The segment information provided herein has been revised for all periods presented to reflect these changes.\nThe discussion summarizing the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 has been excluded from this Form 10-K and can be found in the update to Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 as reported in Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on form 8-K of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 12, 2023 and is incorporated herein by reference.\nOVERVIEW\nThroughout 2023, petrochemical markets faced headwinds from soft global demand, capacity additions and economic uncertainty. Markets were broadly pressured by weak demand for durable goods which impacted margins in the O&P-Americas, O&P-EAI, Intermediates & Derivatives (“I&D”) and APS segments. Refining results declined primarily as a result of lower demand for diesel and other distillates, compared to the prior year. In contrast, oxyfuels margins benefited from tight supply and strong summertime gasoline crack spreads.\nDuring 2023, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $518 million, primarily consisting of a goodwill impairment charge of $252 million in our APS segment and an impairment charge of $192 million related to our European PO joint venture recognized in our I&D segment.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we started up the world's largest propylene oxide (PO) and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) unit in Texas. These new assets on the U.S. Gulf Coast have an annual capacity of 470 thousand metric tons of PO and one million metric tons of TBA and its derivatives.\nIn May 2023, we issued our inaugural $500 million green bond. Proceeds from the bond are being used to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, new or existing eligible green projects in the areas of circular economy, renewable energy, pollution prevention and control, and energy efficiency.\nDuring 2023, we generated $4.9 billion in cash from operating activities. We remain committed to a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Additionally, approximately $1.5 billion was reinvested in the business through capital expenditures while $1.8 billion was returned to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\n39\nResults of operations for the periods discussed are presented in the table below.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenues\n—Revenues decreased by $9,344 million, or 19%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Average sales prices in 2023 were lower for many of our products, as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices, which decreased relative to 2022. These lower prices led to a 21% decrease in revenue. Volume improvements resulted in a 1% increase in revenue, primarily driven by increased I&D sales volumes. Favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a 1% increase in revenue.\nCost of Sales\n—Cost of sales decreased by $7,998 million, or 18%, in 2023 compared to 2022. This decrease primarily related to lower feedstock and energy costs. Fluctuations in our cost of sales are generally driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs. On an annual basis, feedstock and energy related costs generally represent approximately 70% to 80% of cost of sales. Other variable costs account for approximately 10% of cost of sales and fixed operating costs, consisting primarily of expenses associated with employee compensation, depreciation and amortization, and maintenance, account for the remainder.\nImpairments\n—During 2023, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $518 million, primarily consisting of a goodwill impairment charge of $252 million in our APS segment and an impairment charge of $192 million related to our European PO joint venture recognized in our I&D segment. During 2022 we recognized a non-cash impairment of $69 million related to the sale of our Australian polypropylene manufacturing facility. See Notes 8, 9 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding impairment charges.\n40\nSG&A Expenses\n—Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased by $247 million, or 19%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Approximately 60% of this increase was attributable to higher employee-related expenses and the remaining increase was primarily driven by professional fees incurred for strategic projects.\nOperating Income\n—Operating income decreased by $2,048 million, or 40%, in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2023, Operating income decreased for our Refining, O&P-Americas, I&D, APS and O&P-EAI segments by $668 million, $541 million, $342 million, $277 million and $235 million, respectively. Operating income for our Technology segment increased by $3 million in 2023 compared to 2022. Results for each of our business segments are discussed further in the Segment Analysis section below.\nInterest Expense\n—Interest expense increased by $190 million, or 66%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Approximately 55% of this increase was attributable to lower capitalized interest associated with our new PO/TBA plant which started-up in the first quarter of 2023. The remaining increase was primarily due to the impact of our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps driven by higher interest rates in 2023.\nInterest Income\n—Interest income increased by $100 million, or 345%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Approximately three quarters of the increase was due to higher interest rates in 2023. The remaining increase was driven by higher cash balances during 2023.\nIncome Taxes—\nOur effective income tax rates of 19.1% in 2023 and 18.5% in 2022 resulted in tax provisions of $501 million and $882 million, respectively. In 2023, non-deductible impairments, an audit settlement in the second quarter, and fluctuations in uncertain tax positions increased the effective tax rate by 1.1%, 1.4%, and 2.2%, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the effective tax rate of 2.8% related to changes in pre-tax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates and 1.0% related to a patent box ruling received in the fourth quarter of 2023. For additional information, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nComprehensive Income—\nComprehensive income decreased by $2,303 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a decrease in net income. The activities from the remaining components of Comprehensive income are discussed below.\nFinancial derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, primarily our forward-starting interest rate swaps, led to a decrease in Comprehensive income of $288 million in 2023 compared to 2022, due to periodic changes in the benchmark interest rates combined with a decrease in notional outstanding.\nDefined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans led to a decrease in Comprehensive income of $443 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to actuarial losses resulting from lower-than-expected asset returns combined with the absence of pre-tax pension settlements in 2023.\nForeign currency translations increased Comprehensive income by $196 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound sterling in 2023, offset by the effective portion of our net investment hedges.\nSee Notes 14, 15 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions.\n41\nSegment Analysis\nWe use earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes. This measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of, and allocate resources to, our operating segments. Intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations, such as foreign exchange gains (losses) and components of pension and other post-retirement benefit costs other than service cost, are included in “Other.” For additional information related to our operating segments, as well as a reconciliation of EBITDA to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measure, Income from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA for each of the periods presented:\n42\nOur continuing operations are managed through six reportable segments: O&P-Americas, O&P-EAI, I&D, APS, Refining and Technology. Revenues and the components of EBITDA for the periods presented are reflected in the tables below for our reportable segments:\n43\nOlefins and Polyolefins-Americas Segment\nOverview\n—EBITDA decreased in 2023 relative to 2022 primarily driven by lower polyolefin margins.\nIn calculating the impact of margin and volume on EBITDA, consistent with industry practice, management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene co-products against the cost to produce ethylene. Volume and price impacts of ethylene co-products are reported in margin.\nEthylene Raw Materials\n—Ethylene and its co-products are produced from two major raw material groups:\n•\nNGLs, principally ethane and propane, the prices of which are generally affected by natural gas prices; and\n•\ncrude oil-based liquids (“liquids” or “heavy liquids”), including naphtha, condensates and gas oils, the prices of which are generally related to crude oil prices.\nWe have flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our U.S. olefins plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices fluctuate for both feedstocks and products. Although prices of crude-based liquids and natural gas liquids are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices, during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly. Ethane made up approximately 70% of the raw materials used in our North American crackers in 2023 and 2022.\n44\nThe following table sets forth selected financial information for the O&P-Americas segment including Income from equity investments, which is a component of EBITDA.\nRevenues\n—Revenues decreased by $3,200 million, or 22%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Lower average sales prices resulted in a 23% decrease in revenue primarily driven by increased market supply and lower demand. Higher volumes due to improved operating rates resulted in a 1% increase in revenue.\nEBITDA\n—EBITDA decreased by $562 million, or 20%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Lower polyolefins results led to a 29% decrease in EBITDA primarily driven by lower margins as a result of lower average sales prices reflecting softer demand and new industry capacity. Higher olefins results contributed to a 7% increase in EBITDA driven equally by increased volumes and higher margins, due to higher operating rates and lower feedstock and energy costs, respectively.\nOlefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International Segment\nOverview\n—\nEBITDA decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of lower polyolefin margins partially offset by higher olefins results.\nIn calculating the impact of margin and volume on EBITDA, consistent with industry practice, management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene co-products against the cost to produce ethylene. Volume and price impacts of ethylene co-products are reported in margin.\nEthylene Raw Materials\n—In Europe, naphtha is the primary raw material for our ethylene production and represents approximately 65% to 70% of the raw materials used in 2023 and 2022.\nThe following table sets forth selected financial information for the O&P-EAI segment including Loss from equity investments, which is a component of EBITDA.\nRevenues\n—Revenues decreased by $2,976 million, or 22%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Lower average sales prices resulted in a 23% decrease in revenue as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices, which, on average, decreased compared to 2022. Lower volumes resulted in a revenue decrease of 1% primarily due to weak demand. Favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 2%.\n45\nEBITDA\n—EBITDA decreased by $187 million, or 105%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Lower polyolefins results led to a 241% decrease in EBITDA primarily driven by decreased margins due to lower average sales prices reflecting weak demand. Higher olefins results led to an 88% increase in EBITDA driven equally by higher volumes and margins resulting from the absence of planned and unplanned downtime and lower feedstock and energy costs, respectively. In 2022, we recognized a $69 million non-cash impairment charge in conjunction with the sale of our polypropylene manufacturing facility located in Australia. The absence of this charge in 2023 resulted in a 39% increase in EBITDA. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIntermediates and Derivatives Segment\nOverview\n—EBITDA decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by a non-cash impairment charge related to our European PO joint venture recognized in 2023. Segment results were relatively unchanged as improvements in our oxyfuels and related products results were offset by lower margins for propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemicals.\nThe following table sets forth selected financial information for the I&D segment including Loss from equity investments, which is a component of EBITDA.\nRevenues\n—Revenues decreased by $1,864 million, or 14%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Lower average sales prices resulted in a 20% decrease in revenue as a result of lower demand. Sales volumes increased resulting in a 5% increase in revenue primarily due to additional volumes derived from our new PO/TBA facility and strong demand. Favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 1%.\nEBITDA\n—EBITDA decreased $193 million, or 10%, in 2023 compared to 2022. During 2023, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $192 million related to our equity investment in the European PO joint venture resulting in a 10% decrease in EBITDA. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nExcluding the impact of the impairment discussed above, segment results remained relatively unchanged. Improved oxyfuels and related products results led to an EBITDA increase of 31% primarily driven by increased volumes due to increased capacity related to our PO/TBA facility combined with higher margins due to increased gasoline cracks. This improvement was largely offset by a 20% decrease in EBITDA from propylene oxide and derivatives results as margins decreased due to lower demand for durable goods. Lower intermediate chemicals results led to a 9% decrease in EBITDA driven by lower margins as demand softened.\n46\nAdvanced Polymer Solutions Segment\nOverview—\nEBITDA decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the recognition of a $252 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in 2023.\nThe following table sets forth selected financial information for the APS segment including Loss from equity investments, which is a component of EBITDA.\nRevenues\n—Revenues decreased in 2023 by $504 million, or 12%, compared to 2022. Average sales price declines resulted in an 11% decrease in revenue as a result of lower demand. Sales volumes declines resulted in a 2% decrease in revenue stemming from lower demand. Favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 1%.\nEBITDA\n—EBITDA decreased in 2023 by $277 million, or 241%, compared to 2022. During 2023, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $252 million after the effect of moving our\nCatalloy\nand polybutene-1 businesses from our APS segment and reintegrating them into our O&P-Americas and O&P-EAI segments. This impairment charge resulted in a 219% decrease in EBITDA. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Lower volumes resulted in a 43% decrease in EBITDA as a result of a decline in demand. During 2023 and 2022, we recognized a LIFO inventory benefit of $8 million and charge of $21 million, respectively, which resulted in a 25% increase in EBITDA.\nRefining Segment\nOverview\n—EBITDA decreased in 2023 relative to 2022 primarily due to lower margins.\nThe following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude oil processing rates for the Refining segment and the U.S. refining market margins for the applicable periods. “Brent” is a light sweet crude oil and is one of the main benchmark prices for purchases of oil worldwide. “Maya” is a heavy sour crude oil grade produced in Mexico that is a relevant benchmark for heavy sour crude oils in the U.S. Gulf Coast market. References to industry benchmarks for refining market margins are to industry prices reported by Platts, a division of S&P Global.\n47\nRevenues\n—Revenues decreased by $2,179 million, or 18%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Lower product prices led to a revenue decrease of 19% as the average Brent crude oil price decreased approximately $16.68 per barrel. Sales volumes led to a revenue increase 1% due to higher operating rates at our fluid catalytic cracker and coker units, which yielded more higher-value refined products such as gasoline and distillates.\nEBITDA\n—EBITDA decreased by $542 million or 59%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Lower margins drove a 45% decrease in EBITDA primarily due to a decrease in the Maya 2-1-1 industry crack spread of approximately $6 per barrel as a result of lower demand for diesel and other distillates, compared to the prior year. During 2023 and 2022, we recognized a LIFO inventory charge of $42 million and benefit of $40 million, respectively, which resulted in a 9% decrease in EBITDA.\nTechnology Segment\nOverview\n—Our Technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts and the licensing of chemical and polyolefin process technologies. These revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts, licensing and services activities and research and development (“R&D”) activities. In 2023 and 2022, our Technology segment incurred approximately 50% to 55% of all R&D costs.\nEBITDA was relatively unchanged in 2023 compared to 2022 as higher catalyst margins and favorable foreign exchange impacts were partially offset by a decline in catalyst volumes.\nThe following table sets forth selected financial information for the Technology segment.\nRevenues\n—Revenues decreased by $30 million, or 4%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Lower catalyst volumes resulted in an 8% decrease in revenue primarily driven by lower demand. Favorable foreign exchange impact increased revenue by 3%. Higher licensing revenues resulting from more contracts reaching significant milestones drove a 1% increase in revenue.\nEBITDA\n—EBITDA in 2023 increased by $9 million, or 2%, compared to 2022. Higher catalyst margins resulted in a 5% increase in EBITDA. During 2023 and 2022, we recognized a LIFO inventory benefit of $7 million and charge of $13 million, respectively, which resulted in a 5% increase in EBITDA. Lower catalyst volumes resulted in an 11% decrease in EBITDA driven by lower demand. Favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in an EBITDA increase of 3%.\n48\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nOperating, investing and financing activities of continuing operations, which are discussed below, are presented in the following table:\nOperating Activities\n—Cash provided by operating activities of $4,942 million in 2023 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for non-cash items and cash used by the main components of working capital–Accounts receivable, Inventories and Accounts payable.\nIn 2023, the main components of working capital provided $269 million of cash driven by a decrease in Accounts receivable and an increase in Accounts payable. The decrease in Accounts receivable was primarily due to lower revenues in our O&P-Americas, O&P-EAI and APS segments, primarily driven by lower average sales prices. The increase in Accounts payable was primarily driven by higher feedstock and energy costs in our O&P-Americas segment.\nCash provided by operating activities of $6,119 million in 2022 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for non-cash items and cash provided by the main components of working capital.\nIn 2022, the main components of working capital provided $450 million of cash driven by a decrease in Accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in Accounts payable. The decrease in Accounts receivable was primarily due to lower revenues across most businesses primarily driven by lower average sales prices. The decrease in Accounts payable was driven by lower production volumes as a result of lower operating rates.\nInvesting Activities\n—Capital expenditures in 2023 totaled $1,531 million compared to $1,890 million in 2022. Approximately 30% and 50% of our capital expenditures in 2023 and 2022, respectively, was for profit-generating growth projects, largely for our PO/TBA plant, with the remaining expenditures supporting sustaining maintenance. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding capital spending by segment.\nIn 2023, foreign currency contracts with an aggregate notional value of €750 million expired. Upon settlement of these foreign currency contracts, we paid €750 million ($820 million at the expiry spot rate) to our counterparties and received $903 million from our counterparties.\nIn 2022, foreign currency contracts with an aggregate notional value of €500 million expired. Upon settlement of these foreign currency contracts, we paid €500 million ($501 million at the expiry spot rate) to our counterparties and received $614 million from our counterparties.\nFinancing Activities\n—We made dividend payments totaling $1,610 million and $3,246 million, in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 2022 dividend payments included a special dividend of $5.20 per share totaling $1,704 million. Additionally, in 2023 and 2022, we made payments of $211 million and $420 million to repurchase outstanding ordinary shares, respectively. For additional information related to our share repurchases and dividend payments, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n49\nIn 2023, we issued $500 million of 5.625% guaranteed notes due 2033. Additionally, we repaid the $425 million remaining of outstanding principal on our 4.0% guaranteed notes due 2023. For details see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn 2023 and 2022, we made net repayments of $200 million and $4 million, respectively, through the issuance and repurchase of commercial paper instruments under our commercial paper program.\nIn 2022, we received a return of collateral of $238 million related to the positions held with our counterparties for certain forward-starting interest rate swaps. For additional information related to our swaps contracts, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe plan to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and other cash requirements with our current available liquidity and cash from operations, which could be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Debt repayment, and the purchase of shares under our share repurchase authorization, may be funded from cash and cash equivalents, cash from short-term investments, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, or a combination thereof.\nAs part of our overall capital allocation strategy, we plan to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Barring any significant or unforeseen business challenges, mergers or acquisitions, over the long-term, we are targeting shareholder returns of 70% of free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends, with the goal of increasing the dividend over time, after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations. Our focus on funding our dividends while remaining committed to a strong investment grade balance sheet continues to be the foundation of our capital allocation strategy.\nCash and Liquid Investments\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had Cash and cash equivalents totaling $3,390 million, which includes $1,816 million in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., primarily held within the European Union and the United Kingdom. There are currently no legal or economic restrictions that would materially impede our transfers of cash.\nCredit Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2023, we had total debt, including current maturities, of $11,232 million, and $171 million of outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds issued under uncommitted credit facilities.\nWe had total unused availability under our credit facilities of $4,150 million at December 31, 2023, which included the following:\n•\n$3,250 million under our $3,250 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility, which backs our $2,500 million commercial paper program. Availability under this facility is net of outstanding borrowings, outstanding letters of credit provided under the facility and notes issued under our commercial paper program. At December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings of commercial paper, and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility; and\n•\n$900 million under our $900 million U.S. Receivables Facility. Availability under this facility is subject to a borrowing base of eligible receivables, which is reduced by outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, if any. At December 31, 2023 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility.\n50\nAt any time and from time to time, we may repay or redeem our outstanding debt, including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or a combination thereof, in each case using cash and cash equivalents, cash from our short-term investments, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt or proceeds from asset divestitures. Any repayment or redemption of our debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In connection with such repurchases or redemptions, we may incur cash and non-cash charges, which could be material in the period in which they are incurred.\nIn accordance with our current interest rate risk management strategy and subject to management’s evaluation of market conditions and the availability of favorable interest rates among other factors, we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt or convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.\nShare Repurchases\nIn May 2023, our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to 34.0 million ordinary shares, through November 19, 2024, which superseded any prior repurchase authorizations. Our share repurchase authorization does not have a stated dollar amount, and purchases may be made through open market purchases, private market transactions or other structured transactions. Repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes, including for various employee benefit and compensation plans. The maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased is not necessarily an indication of the number of shares that will ultimately be purchased. In 2023, we purchased 2.3 million shares under our share repurchase authorization for $211 million.\nAs of February 20, 2024, we had approximately 33.1 million shares remaining under the current authorization. The timing and amounts of additional shares repurchased, if any, will be determined based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors, including any additional authorizations approved by our shareholders. For additional information related to our share repurchase authorizations, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Budget\nIn 2024, we are planning to invest approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures. Approximately 60% of the 2024 budget is planned for sustaining maintenance, with the remaining budget supporting profit-generating growth projects. Approximately half of our profit-generating growth project budget, or $400 million, is for projects that support our sustainability goals.\nCash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require us to make future cash payments under certain circumstances. Our cash requirements related to contractual and other obligations primarily consist of purchase obligations, principal and interest payments on outstanding debt, lease payments, pension and other post-retirement benefits and income taxes. For more information regarding our debt arrangements, lease obligations, pension and other post-retirement benefits and income taxes, see Notes 12, 13, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.\nWe are party to obligations to purchase raw material\ns, utilities and industrial gases\nwhich are designed to ensure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements.\nThese purchase arrangements include provisions which state minimum purchase quantities; however, in the event we do not take the contractual minimum volumes, we are obligated to compensate the vendor only for any resulting economic losses they suffer. No material fees were paid to vendors for such losses in 2023. Assuming that contractual minimum volumes are purchased at contract prices as of December 31, 2023, these commitments represent approximately 20% of our annual Cost of sales with a weighted average remaining term of 7 years.\n51\nWe also have purchase obligations under take-or-pay agreements which require us to either buy and take delivery of a minimum quantity of goods or to pay for any shortfall. These arrangements largely relate to product off-take agreements with a joint venture located in Poland\n.\nNo material shortfall was paid for quantities not taken under these contracts in 2023. When valued using a contract price as of December 31, 2023, these commitments represent approximately 5% of our annual Cost of sales with a weighted average remaining term of 14 years.\nCURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK\nIn the first quarter of 2024, seasonally slow demand and economic uncertainty provide headwinds for most businesses. Relatively low ethane raw material costs continue to benefit our O&P-Americas margins while regional demand is showing modest improvement.\nWe expect oxyfuels and refining margins to be within typical winter seasonal ranges. In China, Januar\ny demand was subdued as buyers managed inventories around the Lunar New Year holidays and growth remained uncertain. Spring and summer seasonal demand improvements are expected across global markets. We are aligning first quarter operating rates with global demand and expect to operate our O&P-Americas assets at 80% and both our O&P-EAI and I&D assets at 75%.\nValue Enhancement Program (“VEP”)\nDuring 2022, we introduced our VEP, which expands capacity through low-cost debottlenecks and improved reliability, reduces costs and emissions by saving energy and increases margins through improvements in procurement, logistics and customer service. We estimate Net income and recurring annual EBITDA benefits for the VEP based on 2017 through 2019 mid-cycle margins and modest inflation relative to a 2021 baseline year. We believe recurring annual EBITDA is useful to investors because it represents a key measure used by management to assess progress towards our strategy of value creation.\nAt the end of 2023, we estimated VEP benefits to have a year-end annual run rate of approximately $300 million of Net income which, after adding back income taxes and depreciation and amortization of $75 million and $25 million, respectively, results in approximately $400 million of recurring annual EBITDA, which exceeded our original expectations. We incurred one-time costs of approximately $200 million in 2023 to achieve this milestone.\nGiven its performance in 2023, we anticipate that our VEP will achieve a 2024 year-end annual run rate of approximately $445 million of Net income, which, after adding back income taxes and depreciation and amortization of approximately $110 million and $45 million, respectively, results in approximately $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA. We estimate incurring one-time costs of $325 million in 2024 to achieve this milestone.\nBy the end of 2025, the VEP is expected to achieve a 2025 year-end annual run rate of up to $750 million in Net income improvement, which, after adding back income taxes and depreciation and amortization of $185 million and $65 million, respectively, results in up to $1 billion of recurring annual EBITDA.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nWe have related party transactions with our joint venture partners. We believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional related party disclosures.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nManagement applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management and updated periodically based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment.\n52\nManagement believes the following accounting policies and estimates, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are critical in understanding our reported operating results and financial condition.\nInventories\n—We account for our raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods inventories using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting.\nThe cost of raw materials, which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses, and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil and/or natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors, including changes in economic conditions.\nSince our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and correlated materials, as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals, our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in the benchmark of crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods. The degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period, as the composition of the dollar value LIFO pools change. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is performed at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on our estimates of expected inventory levels and costs at the end of the year.\nLIFO value is measured at the total pool level. The impact of the measurement of each LIFO pool at the lower of cost or market value (“LCM”) is a function of the current market prices and the composition, or product mix, of inventory within the pool at the balance sheet date. Due to the compositions of our LIFO pools, changes in market prices of the materials within the pool from period-to-period do not necessarily correlate with LCM charges. An LCM condition may arise due to a volumetric or price decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool.\nAs indicated above, fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods, within the same fiscal year, as market prices recover. Accordingly, our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations.\nWe do not believe any of our inventory is at risk for impairment at this time, however as prices for our products and raw materials are inherently volatile and therefore no prediction can be given with certainty. Given the inherent volatility in the prices of our finished goods and raw materials, sustained price declines could result in LCM inventory valuation charges.\nLong-Lived Assets Impairment Assessment\n—The need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a weakened outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in margins, an expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pre-tax cash flows for an asset group is less than the asset group’s carrying value, fair value is calculated for the asset group using an income approach or a market approach when appropriate, and the carrying value is written down to the calculated fair value. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets including finite-lived intangible assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified.\nSignificant judgment is involved in developing estimates of future cash flows since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions which may include, among other things, projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals (including industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate and end-user demand), new technological developments, capital expenditures, new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages, changes associated with world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries, uncertainties associated with governmental actions and other economic conditions. Such estimates are consistent with those used in our financial planning and business performance reviews.\n53\nWhen an income approach is used to estimate fair value of our long-lived assets, the cash flows are discounted using a rate that is based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible.\nEquity Method Investments Impairment\n—Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the value of the investment. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. For the income approach, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. For the market approach, since quoted market prices are usually not available, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, a trend of adverse financial performance triggered an impairment analysis of our investment in our European PO joint venture. We concluded the asset was impaired and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $192 million. The fair value of our investment in the joint venture was determined using an income approach which utilized unobservable inputs, which generally consist of market information provided by unrelated third parties. Our fair value estimate was based on significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows. These estimates required considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions such as future commodity prices and PO/SM margins. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment determination will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.\nAn estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions, including pricing, volumes, discount rates, and market information provided by unrelated third parties that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.\nIn response to challenging market conditions in China, during 2023, we assessed our equity method investment in Bora LyondellBasell Petrochemical Co. Ltd. (“BLYB”) for impairment and concluded that our $231 million investment in BLYB is not impaired. However, certain circumstances beyond our control could change in the near-term resulting in the need to recognize a non-cash impairment in subsequent periods.\nGoodwill\n—As of December 31, 2023, we had goodwill of $1,647 million, primarily relating to the acquisition of A. Schulman Inc. in 2018 and the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book basis of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy and fresh-start accounting in 2010.\nEffective January 1, 2023, our\nCatalloy\nand polybutene-1 businesses were moved from our APS segment and reintegrated into our O&P-Americas and O&P-EAI segments. When moved, a portion of the APS reporting unit’s goodwill was allocated to the O&P-Americas and O&P-EAI segments based on the fair values of the businesses that were reintegrated relative to the fair value of the APS segment. In the first quarter of 2023, we evaluated goodwill for impairment immediately before and after the transfer of these businesses. Our evaluation resulted in the recognition of a non-cash goodwill impairment of $252 million recognized in our APS segment. See Notes 8 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n54\nAn estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions, including pricing, volumes and discount rates, which could materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, changes in long-term commodity prices, discount rates, competitive environments, planned capacity, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting units. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required.\nWe also have the option to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. Under the quantitative impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit, calculated using a discounted cash flow model, is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. The discounted cash flow model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions, including operating margins, tax rates, discount rates, capital expenditures and working capital changes. If the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized, up to a maximum amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our reporting units within our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment and a qualitative impairment assessment of our other reporting units, which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value including goodwill. Based on this assessment, our historical assessment for impairment and forecasted demand for our products, a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter was not necessary.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units, which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value including goodwill. Accordingly, a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required.\nLong-Term Employee Benefit Costs\n—Our costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and other post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is management’s responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties and to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors.\nThe current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other post-retirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis. The discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. Our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for high-quality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations. For the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at December 31, 2023, we used a weighted average discount rate of 5.80% for the U.S. plans, which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations. The weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for non-U.S. plans at December 31, 2023, was 4.00%, reflecting market interest rates. The discount rates in effect at December 31, 2023 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2024.\nThe benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost of other post-retirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. As of December 31, 2023, the assumed rate of increase for our U.S. plans was 6.3%, decreasing to 4.5% in 2031 and thereafter.\n55\nThe net periodic benefit cost of pension benefits included in expense is affected by the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption. Investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets applied to a market-related value of plan assets, which is defined as the market value of assets. The expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer-term rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate, reflecting long-term market expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market conditions.\nThe weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets in our U.S. plans of 7.25% is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor advised could be expected to be earned over time. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets in our non-U.S. plans of 3.57% is based on expectations and asset allocations that vary by region. The asset allocations are summarized in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. Management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility.\nNet periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings, rather than the actual earnings or loss. Along with other gains and losses, this unrecognized amount, to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of the plan assets for the respective plan, is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:\nThe sensitivity of our post-retirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table:\nAdditional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n56\nAccruals for Taxes Based on Income\n—The determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.\nWe recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not. Our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions. Further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes, which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated.\nWe recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities.\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING CHANGES\nFor a discussion of the potential impact of new accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n57"

    "text": "See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our management of commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.\nCommodity Price Risk\n—Prices for our products and raw materials are subject to changes in supply and demand. Natural gas, crude oil, utilities, and refined products, along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production, constitute the main commodity exposures. Pricing terms in our raw material contracts are generally indexed to market prices. Changes in market prices for raw materials generally correlate with market prices for our products. In certain sales contracts, we may negotiate pricing terms to better align with changes in raw material costs. We also selectively enter commodity swap, option and futures contracts to manage commodity price risk. We estimate that a 10% change in commodity prices as of December 31, 2023, would change the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts by approximately $36 million; while a 10% change in commodity prices as of December 31, 2022, would not materially impact the fair values of our commodity derivative contracts.\nForeign Exchange Risk\n—We manufacture and market our products in many countries throughout the world and, as a result, are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Many of our operating entities use the euro as their functional currency. Translation adjustments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nWe enter foreign currency derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges to reduce the volatility in Shareholders’ equity resulting from translation adjustments associated with our net investments in foreign operations. We also enter foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows associated with intercompany debt balances. The table below illustrates the impact on other comprehensive income (loss) of a 10% fluctuation in the foreign currency rate associated with the hedges at December 31:\nSome of our consolidated entities enter transactions that are not denominated in their functional currency. This results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments, including, but not limited to, third-party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans.\nOur policy is to maintain a balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates. We maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our inter-company and third party outstanding foreign currency balances. These practices involve the centralization of our exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank and/or country specific restrictions. By centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary, we are able to take advantage of natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings.\n58\nTo minimize the effects of our net currency exchange exposures, we enter into forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps. We also engage in short-term forward exchange contracts to manage our net exposure to foreign currencies as economic hedges. Changes in the fair value of these foreign currency contracts are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on foreign currency balances.\nOther (expense) income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income reflects net foreign currency losses of\n$34 million and\n$14 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, our foreign currency contracts that are accounted for as economic hedges mature between January 2024 and January 2025, inclusively, and had an aggregate notional amount of $555 million. A 10% fluctuation compared to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in an additional impact to earnings of approximately $21 million and $17 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInterest Rate Risk\n—We are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed-rate debt and expose us to the risk that we may need to refinance debt at higher rates. Fluctuations in interest rates impact interest expense from our variable-rate debt. To minimize earnings at risk as part of our interest rate risk management strategy, we target to maintain floating-rate debt, through the use of interest rate swaps and issuance of variable-rate debt, equal to our cash and cash equivalents, as those assets earn interest based on floating-rates.\nPre-issuance interest rate\n—To mitigate the risk that benchmark interest rates may increase in connection with future financing activities, we adopted a pre-issuance interest rate strategy, under which we entered forward-starting interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges. We estimate that a 10% change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, would change the fair value of these forward-starting interest rate swaps by approximately $12\nmillion\nand $23 million, respectively.\nFixed-rate debt\n—We enter into interest rate swaps that effectively convert our fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total notional amount of these interest rate swaps was\n$2,171 million\nand\n$2,164 million\n, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2023, after giving consideration to the fixed-rate debt that we have effectively converted to variable-rate debt, approximately 80% of our debt portfolio, on a gross basis, incurred interest at a fixed-rate and the remaining 20% of the portfolio incurred interest at a variable-rate. We estimate that a 10% change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, would change the fair value of these interest rate swaps by approximately $14 million and $35 million, respectively.\nVariable-rate debt\n—At December 31, 2023, we have no borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program. We also have available borrowing capacity under our $3,250 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility and our $900 million U.S. Receivables Facility. At December 31, 2023, there were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under these facilities. Based on our average variable-rate debt outstanding per year, we estimate that a 10% change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 would not materially impact the fair value of these facilities.\n59"

    "text": "Index to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n60\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL\nOVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nWe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on our evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\n61\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n62\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nTaxation - Provisions for unrecognized tax benefits\nAs described in Notes 2, 10, 11, and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded an income tax provision of $501 million, income tax receivables of $268 million, income tax payables of $143 million, and net deferred tax liabilities of $2,690 million related to which they have reported $288 million of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company operates in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world, and its tax returns are periodically audited or subjected to review by tax authorities. As a result, there is an uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management recognizes uncertain income tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position or a portion thereof will be sustained upon examination. As disclosed by management, there continues to be increased attention to the tax practices of multinational companies, in particular in the U.S. and Europe where the Company operates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the provision for unrecognized tax benefits is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining provisions for unrecognized tax benefits, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the complexity of tax laws, frequency of tax audits, and potential for adjustments as a result of such tax audits; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s timely identification of tax uncertainties; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n63\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and controls addressing completeness of the uncertain tax positions. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained; (ii) testing the completeness of management’s assessment of both the identification and possible outcomes of uncertain tax positions; and (iii) evaluating the status and results of tax audits with the relevant tax authorities. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the completeness of the Company’s uncertain tax positions, including evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment of whether tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained and the amount of potential benefit to be realized, as well as the determination and the application of relevant tax laws.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 22, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\n64\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n65\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n66\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n67\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n68\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n69\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n70\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n71\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n72\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nDescription of Company and Operations\nLyondellBasell Industries N.V. is a limited liability company (\nNaamloze Vennootschap\n) incorporated under Dutch law by deed of incorporation dated October 15, 2009. Unless otherwise indicated, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar words are used to refer to LyondellBasell Industries N.V. together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“LyondellBasell N.V.”).\nLyondellBasell N.V. is a worldwide manufacturer of chemicals and polymers, a refiner of crude oil, a significant producer of gasoline blending components and a developer and licensor of technologies for the production of polymers.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Preparation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared from the books and records of LyondellBasell N.V. under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Subsidiaries are defined as being those companies over which we, either directly or indirectly, have control through a majority of the voting rights or the right to exercise control or to obtain the majority of the benefits and be exposed to the majority of the risks. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained until the date that such control ceases. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nEffective January 1, 2023, our\nCatalloy\nand polybutene-1 businesses were moved from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment and reintegrated into our Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas and Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International segments. Segment information provided within has been revised for all periods presented to reflect these changes.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nOur cash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments such as certificates of deposit, commercial paper and money market accounts with major international banks and financial institutions. Cash equivalents also include other instruments with maturities of three months or less when acquired and exclude restricted cash.\nShort-Term Investments\nOur investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity on the basis of our intent and ability to hold the investments. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with changes reflected in other comprehensive income (loss). Credit-related impairments, measured using expected cash flows and limited to the amount by which the amortized cost basis of a security exceeds its fair value, are recognized through an allowance for expected credit losses, and adjusted subsequently if conditions change, with a corresponding impact in earnings. Where there is an intention or a requirement to sell an impaired available-for-sale debt security, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security.\nInvestments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses recorded through Net income.\nTrade Receivables\nTrade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business and are carried at transaction price net of allowance for credit losses. Allowance for credit losses is measured using historical loss rates for the respective risk categories and incorporating forward-looking estimates. The corresponding expense for the loss allowance is reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n73\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nInventories\nCost of our raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method and is carried at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of our materials and supplies inventory is determined using the average cost method and is carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value.\nInventory exchange transactions, which involve fungible commodities, are not accounted for as purchases and sales. Any resulting volumetric exchange balances are accounted for as inventory, with cost determined using the LIFO method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost. Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Costs may also include borrowing costs incurred on debt during construction of major projects exceeding one year, costs of major maintenance arising from turnarounds of major units and legally obligated decommissioning costs. Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets to their residual values. The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, whenever events or circumstances indicate that a revision is warranted. Land is not depreciated.\nWe evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which, for us, is generally at the plant group level (or, at times, individual plants in certain circumstances where we have isolated production units with separately identifiable cash flows). If it is determined that an asset or asset group’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.\nEquity Investments\nWe account for equity method investments (“equity investments”) using the equity method of accounting if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over, but do not control an investee. Significant influence generally exists if we have an ownership interest representing between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are stated initially at cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and our proportionate share of profit or losses and distributions.\nWe record our share of the profits or losses of the equity investments, net of income taxes, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. When our share of losses in an equity investment equals or exceeds the carrying amount of our investment including advances made by us, we do not recognize further losses, unless we have guaranteed obligations or are otherwise committed to provide further financial support to the investee.\nWe assess our equity investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value.\nInvestments in PO Joint Ventures and the Louisiana Joint Venture\n—We share ownership with Covestro PO LLC, a subsidiary of Covestro AG (collectively “Covestro”), in a U.S. propylene oxide (“PO”) joint venture located in Texas (the “U.S. PO Joint Venture”) and a PO/styrene monomer (“SM” or “styrene”) joint venture located in The Netherlands (the “European PO Joint Venture”), collectively the (“PO Joint Ventures”). We operate the PO Joint Ventures manufacturing facilities and arrange the logistics of product delivery. Each partner funds their share of capital expenditures, reimburses manufacturing operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expenses, and receives a share of production in-kind.\n74\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe U.S. PO Joint Venture owns a PO/SM and a PO/tertiary butyl alcohol (“TBA”) plant. Covestro’s interest in the U.S. PO Joint Venture represents ownership of an in-kind portion of the PO production of\n680\nthousand tons per year. We take, in-kind, the remaining PO production and all co-product production.\nThe European PO Joint Venture owns a PO/SM plant in which each partner is entitled to\n50\n% of the annual in-kind cost-based PO and SM production.\nWe entered into a joint venture agreement with Sasol Chemicals (USA) LLC (“Sasol”) to form the Louisiana Integrated PolyEthylene JV LLC joint venture (the “Louisiana Joint Venture”). Under this arrangement, we acquired a\n50\n% ownership interest in an ethane cracker, a low-density and linear-low density polyethylene plant, and associated infrastructure. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, each partner provides pro-rata share of ethane feedstocks and off-takes pro-rata shares of cracker and polyethylene products in-kind. We operate the Louisiana Joint Venture assets and market the polyethylene off-take for all partners through our global sales team.\nWe account for the PO Joint Ventures and the Louisiana Joint Venture using the equity method. The joint ventures were formed solely for the benefit of the partners and do not manufacture for any other parties. We report the cost of our product off-take as Inventory and the equity loss as Cost of sales in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Related production cash flows are reported in the operating cash flow section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nOur equity investment in the PO Joint Ventures and the Louisiana Joint Venture represents our share of the manufacturing plants and is decreased by recognition of our share of equity loss, which is equal to the depreciation of the assets of these joint ventures. Other changes in the investment balance are principally due to our additional capital contributions to these joint ventures to fund capital expenditures. Such contributions are reported in the investing cash flow section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nOur product off-take of PO and its co-products from the PO Joint Ventures was\n2.2\nmillion,\n2.4\nmillion and\n2.6\nmillion tons in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our product off-take of ethylene and polyethylene produced from the Louisiana Joint Venture was\n1.2\nmillion,\n1.0\nmillion, and\n1.1\nmillion tons in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nRedeemable Non-controlling Interests\nOur redeemable non-controlling interests relate to shares of cumulative perpetual special stock (“redeemable non-controlling interest stock”) issued by our consolidated subsidiary, formerly known as A. Schulman, Inc. (“A. Schulman”). Holders of redeemable non-controlling interest stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of\n6\n% per share and the liquidation preference of $\n1,000\nper share. Redeemable non-controlling interest stock may be redeemed at any time at the discretion of the holders and is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets outside of permanent equity. Dividends on these shares are deducted from or added to the amount of Income (loss) attributable to the Company shareholders if and when declared by the Company.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying amount. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, changes in long-term commodity prices, discount rates, competitive environments, planned capacity, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting units. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a quantitative test is required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized up to a maximum amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n75\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nEffective January 1, 2023, our\nCatalloy\nand polybutene-1 businesses were moved from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment and reintegrated into our Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas and Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International segments. Related to this change we evaluated goodwill for impairment immediately before and after the transfer of these businesses. Our evaluation resulted in the recognition of a non-cash goodwill impairment of $\n252\nmillion in our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2023. See Notes 8 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our reporting units within our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment and a qualitative impairment assessment of our other reporting units, which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value including goodwill. Based on this assessment, our historical assessment for impairment and forecasted demand for our products, a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter was not necessary.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of emission allowances, various contracts, software costs, patents and trademarks, know-how, and in-process research and development costs. These assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or over the term of the related agreement. We evaluate definite-lived intangible assets with the associated long-lived asset group for impairment whenever impairment indicators are present.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed when incurred. Subsidies for R&D are included in Other (expense) income, net. Depreciation expense related to assets employed in R&D is included as a cost of R&D.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) or directly in equity. In these cases, the applicable tax amount is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) or directly in equity, respectively.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes, as well as the net tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe recognize uncertain income tax positions in our financial statements when we believe it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position or a portion thereof will be sustained upon examination. For a position that is more likely than not to be sustained, the benefit recognized is measured at the largest cumulative amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized.\nOther Provisions\nEnvironmental Remediation Costs\n—Environmental remediation liabilities include liabilities related to sites we currently own, sites we no longer own, as well as sites where we have operated that belong to other parties. Liabilities for anticipated expenditures related to investigation and remediation of contaminated sites are accrued when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Only certain post-remediation monitoring costs, the timing of which can be determined with reasonable certainty, are discounted to present value.\n76\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n—At some sites, we are legally obligated to decommission our plants upon site exit. Asset retirement obligations are recorded at the fair value using the present value of the estimated costs to retire the asset at the time the obligation is incurred. That cost, which is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful life of the related asset. Accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability is recognized over the estimated timeline to settle the obligation. Such depreciation and accretion expenses are included in Cost of sales.\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\nFunctional and Reporting Currency\n—Items included in the financial information of each of LyondellBasell N.V.’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”) and then translated to the U.S. dollar (“the reporting currency”) as follows:\n•\nAssets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;\n•\nIncome and expenses for each income statement are translated at monthly average exchange rates; and\n•\nAll resulting exchange differences are recognized as a separate component within other comprehensive income (loss) (foreign currency translation adjustments).\nTransactions and Balances\n—Foreign currency transactions are recorded in their respective functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are recognized in earnings.\nRevenue Recognition\nSubstantially all our revenues are derived from contracts with customers. We account for contracts when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform, the rights of the parties and payment terms have been identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is probable.\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied. This generally occurs at the point in time when performance obligations are fulfilled and control transfers to the customer. In most instances, control transfers upon transfer of risk of loss and title to the customer, which usually occurs when we ship products to the customer from our manufacturing facility. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Customer incentives are generally based on volumes purchased and recognized over the period earned. Sales, value-added, and other taxes that we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from the transaction price as they represent amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We apply the practical expedient to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Shipping and handling costs are treated as a fulfillment cost and not a separate performance obligation.\nWe have marketing arrangements to off-take and sell the production of some of our joint ventures in return for a percentage of the price realized on the sales to the end customer. In such arrangements, when we obtain control of the product, revenue and cost of sales are presented on a gross basis. Otherwise, we recognize revenue, net of amounts due to the joint venture, which represents commissions earned.\nPayments are typically required within a short period following the transfer of control of the product to the customer. We occasionally require customers to prepay purchases to ensure collectability. Such prepayments do not represent financing arrangements, since payment occurs within a short time frame. We apply the practical expedient which permits us to disregard the effects of a significant financing component when, at contract inception, we expect the period between the payment and fulfillment of the performance obligation will be one year or less.\n77\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nContract balances typically arise when a difference in timing between the transfer of control to the customer and receipt of consideration occurs. Our contract liabilities, which are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements as Accrued and other current liabilities, and Other liabilities, consist primarily of customer payments for products or services received before the transfer of control to the customer occurs.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe grant restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock option awards (“Stock options”), performance share units (“PSUs”), and other cash and stock awards to employees as a form of compensation. Our share-based compensation awards are accounted for as equity-classified awards with compensation expense based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the vesting period in the income statement. We use a straight-line vesting method for cliff-vested awards and a graded vesting method for ratable-vested awards. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur for stock-based compensation. When options are exercised and awards are paid out, shares are issued from our treasury shares. The holders of unvested RSUs are entitled to nonforfeitable dividend equivalents settled in the form of cash payments, which are recognized as dividends in Retained earnings. Outstanding PSUs accrue dividend equivalent units, which will be converted to shares upon payment at the end of the performance period and are classified as Accrued and other current liabilities and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Dividend equivalents for PSUs are also recorded in Retained earnings.\nSee Notes 16 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLeases\nLeases with a term longer than 12 months are recorded on the balance sheet as a lease asset and lease liability. If at inception of a contract, a lease is identified, we recognize a lease asset and a corresponding lease liability based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate, unless an implicit rate is readily determinable. Lease payments include fixed and variable lease components derived from usage or market-based indices, such as the consumer price index. Other variable lease payments may fluctuate for a variety of reasons including usage, output, insurance or taxes. These variable amounts are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets or lease liabilities. Options to extend or terminate a lease are reflected in the lease payments and lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The majority of our leases are operating leases for which we recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We apply the practical expedient to account for lease and associated non-lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes with the exception of utilities and pipeline assets within major manufacturing equipment. For these assets, non-lease components are separated from lease components and accounted for as normal operating expenses. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nFinancial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nPursuant to our risk management policies, we selectively enter into derivative transactions to manage market risk volatility associated with changes in commodity pricing, currency exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivatives used for this purpose are designated as net investment hedges, cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges are recorded in earnings.\nCash flows from derivatives designated as hedges are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items unless the derivative contract contains a significant financing element. Cash flows for derivatives with a significant financing element are classified as Cash flows from financing activities. Cash flows related to economic hedges are classified consistent with the cash flows of the economic hedged items.\n78\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNet Investment Hedges\n—We enter into foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt to reduce the volatility in shareholders’ equity resulting from changes in currency exchange rates of our foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. Our foreign currency derivatives consist of cross-currency contracts and forward exchange contracts.\nWe use the critical terms approach through the application of the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness at least quarterly. For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, gains or losses attributable to changes in spot foreign exchange rates over the designation period are reflected in foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income (loss). Recognition in earnings is delayed until the net investment is sold or liquidated. At that time, the amount recognized is reported in the same line item as the gain or loss on the liquidation of the hedged foreign operations. For our cross-currency swaps, the associated interest receipts and payments are recorded in Interest expense. For our foreign currency forward contracts, we amortize initial forward point values on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the life of the hedging instrument. We monitor on a quarterly basis for any over-hedged positions requiring de-designation and re-designation of the hedge to remove such over-hedged condition.\nCash Flow Hedges\n—We enter into cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows of a future transaction. Our cash flow hedges include cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps and commodity swaps. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and released to earnings in the same line item and in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings.\nWe use the critical terms and the quantitative long-haul methods to assess hedge effectiveness and monitor, at least quarterly, any change in effectiveness.\nWe have cross-currency swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges to reduce our exposure to the foreign currency exchange risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, we make interest payments in euros and receive interest in U.S. dollars. Upon the maturities of these contracts, we will pay the principal amount of the loans in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.\nWe enter into forward-starting interest rate contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on future anticipated debt issuances.\nWe also execute commodity futures, options and swaps to manage the volatility of the commodity price related to anticipated purchases of raw materials and product sales. We enter into over-the-counter commodity swaps and options with one or more counterparties whereby we pay a predetermined fixed price and receive a price based on the average monthly rate of a specified index for the specified nominated volumes.\nFair Value Hedges\n—We use interest rate swaps as part of our current interest rate risk management strategy to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt. Under these arrangements, we exchange fixed-rate for floating-rate interest payments to effectively convert our fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt. For derivatives that have been designated as fair value hedges, the gains and losses of the derivatives and hedged items are recorded in earnings.\nWe use the long-haul method to assess hedge effectiveness using a regression analysis approach at least quarterly. We perform the regression analysis over an observation period of three years, utilizing data that is relevant to the hedge duration.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe categorize assets and liabilities, measured at fair value, into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable. Level 3 inputs are model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable.\n79\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nFair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.\nChanges in Fair Value Levels\n—Management reviews the disclosures regarding fair value measurements at least quarterly. If an instrument classified as Level 1 subsequently ceases to be actively traded, it is transferred out of Level 1. In such cases, instruments are reclassified as Level 2, unless the measurement of its fair value requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, in which case it is reclassified as Level 3.\nWe use the following inputs and valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCross-Currency Swaps\n—The fair value of our cross-currency swaps is calculated using the present value of future cash flows discounted using observable inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield curves, basis curves, as applicable, and with the foreign currency leg revalued using published spot and forward exchange rates on the valuation date.\nForward-Starting and Fixed-for-Floating Interest Rate Swaps\n—The fair value of our forward-starting and fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps is calculated using the present value of future cash flows using observable inputs such as benchmark interest rates and market yield curves.\nCommodity Derivatives\n—The fair values of our commodity derivatives are measured using closing market prices of public exchanges and from third-party broker quotes and pricing providers.\nThe fair value of our commodity swaps classified as Level 2 is determined using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs. The observable inputs consist of future market values of various crude and heavy fuel oils, which are readily available through public data sources. The unobservable input, which is the estimated discount or premium used in the market pricing, is calculated using an internally-developed, multi-linear regression model based on the observable prices of the known components and their relationships to historical prices. A significant change in this unobservable input would not have a material impact on the fair value measurement of our Level 2 commodity swaps.\nForward Exchange Contracts\n—The fair value of our forward exchange contracts is based on forward market rates.\nEquity Securities—\nThe fair value of our investment in equity securities is based on the net asset value provided by the fund administrator.\nShort-Term Debt\n—The fair value of short-term borrowings related to precious metal financing arrangements accounted for as embedded derivatives is determined based on the future price of the associated precious metal.\nLong-Term Debt\n—The fair value of our senior and guaranteed notes is calculated using pricing data obtained from well-established and recognized vendors of market data for debt valuations. The fair value of our term loan was determined based on a discounted cash flow model using observable inputs such as benchmark interest rates and public information regarding our credit risk.\nFair Value Measurements - Pension Assets\nWe use the following inputs and valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our pension assets disclosed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCommon and Preferred Stock—\nValued at the closing price reported on the market on which the individual securities are traded.\n80\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nFixed Income Securities—\nCertain securities that are not traded on an exchange are valued at the closing price reported by pricing services. Other securities are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.\nCommingled Funds—\nValued based upon the net asset value of units of such commingled trust funds held at year end by the pension plans. Unit values are based on the fair value of the underlying assets of the fund derived from inputs principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\nReal Estate—\nValued based upon the net asset value of units of the real estate fund or partnership held by the master trust at year end.\nHedge Funds—\nValued based upon the unit values of such alternative investments held at year end by the pension plans. Unit values are based on the fair value of the underlying assets of the fund.\nPrivate Equity—\nValued based upon the unit values of such alternative investments held at year end by the pension plans. Unit values are based on the fair value of the underlying assets of the fund. Certain securities held in the fund are valued at the closing price reported on an exchange or other established quotation service for over-the-counter securities. Other assets held in the fund are valued based on the most recent financial statements prepared by the fund manager.\nConvertible Securities—\nValued at the quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.\nU.S. Government Securities—\nCertain securities, including Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (“STRIPS”), are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.\nCash and Cash Equivalents—\nValued at the quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nNon-U.S. Insurance Arrangements\n—Valued based upon the estimated cash surrender value of the underlying insurance contract, which is derived from an actuarial determination of the discounted benefits cash flows.\nEmployee Benefits\nPension Plans—\nWe have funded and unfunded defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. For the defined benefit plans, a projected benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Pension costs primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for pension benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on this obligation in respect of employee service in previous years, net of expected return on plan assets.\nActuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity and are reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which they arise.\nOther Post-Employment Obligations—\nCertain employees are entitled to post-retirement medical benefits upon retirement. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment applying the same accounting methodology used for defined benefit plans.\nTermination Benefits—\nContractual termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated due to an event specified in the provisions of a social/labor plan or statutory law. A liability is recognized for one-time termination benefits when we are committed to (i) make payments and the number of affected employees and the benefits to be received are known to both parties, and (ii) terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal and can reasonably estimate such amount. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to present value.\n81\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSupply Chain Finance Arrangements\nIn an effort to maintain a strong and efficient supply chain, we facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program that provides suppliers, at their sole discretion, the opportunity to sell their receivables due from us to a participating financial intermediary in order to be paid earlier than our contracted payment terms. We are not a party to any agreement between our suppliers and the financial intermediary. When a supplier utilizes the program and receives an early payment from the financial intermediary, the supplier takes a discount on the invoice. We pay the financial intermediary the full amount of the invoice on the contractually agreed upon due date. The majority of the suppliers using the program are on 90-day payment terms. There is no economic impact to the Company from a supplier’s decision to take an early payment. No guarantees are provided by us or any of our subsidiaries under the program.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nAccounts payable-Trade\nincluded $\n65\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion, respectively, payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the supply chain financing program.\nRecently Adopted Guidance\nSupplier Finance Program\n—In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04,\nLiabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50)\n:\nDisclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n. The guidance requires an entity that uses supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services to disclose certain qualitative and quantitative information about its programs including the key terms and conditions, activity during the period, and potential magnitude. The guidance is effective retrospectively for the year ending December 31, 2023, including interim periods, with disclosures required for each period for which a balance sheet is presented, except for the disclosure of roll forward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccounting Guidance Issued But Not Adopted as of December 31, 2023\nFair Value Measurement\n—In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03,\nFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions\n. The guidance clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security because it is a characteristic of the entity holding the equity security rather than a characteristic of the security and is not considered in measuring its fair value. The guidance is effective prospectively for the year ending December 31, 2024, including the interim periods, with the impact of adoption reflected in earnings. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSegment Disclosures\n—In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n. The guidance improves the disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and addresses requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting the new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n82\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nIncome Tax Disclosures\n—In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 74): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\nThe guidance requires companies to disclose certain specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet the quantitative threshold of 5% of the expected tax using the applicable statutory income tax rate. There is also a required disclosure to provide the net income taxes paid or received disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes with jurisdictions to be separately disclosed if the jurisdiction is 5% or more of the total net income taxes paid or received. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting the new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n3.\nAssets Held for Sale\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell our U.S. Gulf Coast-based ethylene oxide and derivatives (“EO&D”) business along with the production facility located in Bayport, TX for cash consideration of $\n700\nmillion, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The EO&D business had been identified as a non-core business within our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024 following completion of the planned maintenance at the facility and is subject to regulatory and other customary closing conditions.\nThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities held for sale:\n4.\nRevenues\nContract Balances—\nContract liabilities were $\n175\nmillion and $\n167\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue recognized in each reporting period, included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period, was immaterial.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\n—We participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines. Our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals. Our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics. Our plastic products are used in large volumes as well as smaller specialty applications. Our refining business consists of our Houston refinery, which processes crude oil into refined products such as gasoline and distillates.\n83\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nRevenues disaggregated by key products are summarized below:\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by geography, based upon the location of the customer:\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\n— Our contracts with customers are commodity supply arrangements that settle based on market prices at future delivery dates; therefore, transaction prices are entirely variable. Transaction prices are known at the time revenue is recognized since they are generally determined by the commodity price index at a specific date, at month-end or at the month average once products are shipped to our customers. Future estimates of transaction prices for disclosure purposes are substantially constrained as they are highly susceptible to factors outside our control, including volatility in commodity markets, industry production capacities and operating rates, planned and unplanned industry operating interruptions, foreign exchange rates and worldwide geopolitical trends. We have elected the practical expedient to not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations with an original contract duration of one year or less.\n84\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n5.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have related party transactions with our joint venture partners, which are classified as equity investees (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). These related party transactions include the sales and purchases of goods and services in the normal course of business as well as certain financing arrangements.\nThese transactions are summarized as follows:\nRelated Party Notes Receivable—\nIn July 2022, we executed a loan agreement with our joint venture partner to lend CNY\n300\nmillion (approximately $\n42\nmillion as of December 31, 2023) to our joint venture Bora LyondellBasell Petrochemical Co. Ltd. (“BLYB”). The loan matured\nsix months\nfrom issuance with the option to extend up to\nnine\ntimes, in\nsix months\nincrements, with consent of the joint venture partners. As of December 31, 2023, the loan has been extended twice and matures in February 2024. It is expected the loan will be extended a third time in the first quarter of 2024. Interest accrues at the\none-year\nprime rate from People’s Bank of China and is payable quarterly.\nOther—\nWe have guaranteed $\n18\nmillion of the indebtedness of\ntwo\nof our joint ventures as of December 31, 2023.\n6.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe sell our products primarily to other industrial concerns in the petrochemical and refining industries. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and, in certain circumstances, require letters of credit or corporate guarantees from them. Our Accounts receivable are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of allowance for credit losses of $\n6\nmillion in each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. We recorded allowance for credit losses for receivables, which are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income, however, such amounts were immaterial for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n7.\nInventories\nInventories consisted of the following components at December 31:\n85\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately\n78\n% and\n77\n%, respectively, of our inventories were valued using the last in, first out (“LIFO”) method and the remaining inventories, consisting primarily of materials and supplies, were valued at the moving average cost method. The excess of our inventories at estimated net realizable value over LIFO cost was approximately $\n1,478\nmillion and $\n1,586\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n8.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n—The components of property, plant and equipment, at cost, and the related accumulated depreciation are as follows at December 31:\nCapitalized Interest—\nWe capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, we capitalized interest of $\n7\nmillion, $\n114\nmillion and $\n97\nmillion, respectively.\nIntangible Assets\n—The components of identifiable intangible assets, at cost, and the related accumulated amortization are as follows at December 31:\nAmortization of these identifiable intangible assets for the next five years is expected to be $\n85\nmillion in 2024, $\n82\nmillion in 2025, $\n59\nmillion in 2026, $\n37\nmillion in 2027 and $\n36\nmillion in 2028.\n86\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nHouston Refinery Impairment\n—During the fourth quarter of 2021, following a review of strategic options for the Houston refinery, we determined there was an increased likelihood of the asset’s disposal prior to the end of its expected useful life. As a result, we assessed the Houston refinery for impairment and recognized a $\n624\nmillion non-cash impairment charge that included a $\n549\nmillion impairment of property, plant and equipment, a $\n43\nmillion impairment of materials and supplies and a $\n32\nmillion impairment of intangible assets, which reduced the assets’ carrying values to their fair values. The impairment was a result of our assessment that the fair value of the Houston refinery’s property, plant and equipment, materials and supplies and intangible assets were all\nzero\nas of December 31, 2021. The fair values of the impaired assets were determined using market information provided by unrelated third parties. The fair value measurement for the asset group is classified as Level 3. The charge is reflected as Impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\n—Depreciation and amortization expense is summarized as follows:\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n—In certain cases, we are contractually obligated to decommission our plants upon site exit. In such cases, we have accrued the net present value of the estimated costs.\nThe changes in our asset retirement obligations are as follows:\nIn connection with the planned exit from the refinery business, we recorded liabilities for asset retirement obligations of $\n259\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the planned exit. The remaining asset retirement obligations are primarily related to facilities in Europe.\n87\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAlthough we may have asset retirement obligations associated with some of our other facilities, the present value of those obligations is not material in the context of an indefinite expected life of the facilities. We continually review the optimal future alternatives for our facilities. Any decision to retire one or more facilities may result in an increase in the present value of such obligations.\nDiscontinued Operations\n—We began reporting the Berre refinery as a discontinued operation in the second quarter of 2012. The estimated cost and associated cash flows pertaining to the final closure and dismantlement of our Berre refinery from the Prefect of Bouches du Rhone are not deemed to be material.\nGoodwill\n—The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill in each of the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nThe carrying amount of goodwill at December 31, 2023 is reflected net of accumulated impairment charges of $\n252\nmillion related to our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. There were\nno\naccumulated impairment charges reflected in the carrying amount of goodwill at December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, goodwill included in our Advanced Polymer Solutions reporting unit was $\n1,370\nmillion, the majority of which related to the 2018 acquisition of A. Schulman. As of December 31, 2022, a large portion of the Advanced Polymer Solutions reporting unit’s fair value was derived from our\nCatalloy\nand polybutene-1 businesses, which had disproportionately low carrying values in comparison to the remaining assets of the reporting unit, which had relatively higher carrying values due to the 2018 purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition of A. Schulman. Effective January 1, 2023, our\nCatalloy\nand polybutene-1 businesses were moved from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment and reintegrated into our Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas and Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International segments. Accordingly, on January 1, 2023, we allocated goodwill of $\n584\nmillion from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment to our Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas and Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International segments. The amounts allocated were $\n315\nmillion and $\n269\nmillion for Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas and Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International segments, respectively. The allocation was based on the fair values of the businesses that were reintegrated relative to the fair value of the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.\nAs a result of the reallocation of goodwill and the change in both fair value and carrying value among reporting units, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $\n252\nmillion in the first quarter of 2023 in our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Fair values were determined utilizing a discounted cash flow method under the income approach and assumptions including management’s view on long-term growth rates in our industry, discount rates and other assumptions based on a market participant perspective, which are inherently subjective. The fair value of the reporting unit is Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The charge is reflected as Impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n88\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n9.\nEquity Investments\nOur principal direct and indirect equity investments are as follows at December 31:\nThe following table summarizes changes in our equity investments:\nCapital contributions in 2023 and 2022 include $\n32\nmillion and $\n69\nmillion, respectively, related to our PO Joint Ventures.\nEuropean PO Joint Venture Impairment—\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, due to a trend of negative financial performance and the unfavorable long-term economic outlook for the joint venture, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n192\nmillion, representing a full write down of our investment in the European PO joint venture. The fair value of our investment was determined using an income approach and the significant inputs used in our fair value determination, including projected cash flows and the discount rate, are considered Level 3. The charge is reflected as Impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n89\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nSummarized balance sheet information of our investments accounted for under the equity method (presented on a 100% basis) at December 31 are as follows:\nSummarized income statement information of our investments accounted for under the equity method (presented on a 100% basis) are as follows:\nSubsequent event—\nIn January 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire a\n35\n% interest in Saudi Arabia-based National Petrochemical Industrial Company (“NATPET”) from Alujain Corporation for approximately $\n500\nmillion. Enabled by its\nSpheripol\npolypropylene (PP) technology, the joint venture positions us to grow and upgrade our core PP business through access to advantaged feedstocks, plus additional product marketing capacity, in a strategic region. Closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory and other customary closing conditions. The joint venture will be included prospectively within our Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International segment.\n90\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n10.\nPrepaid Expenses, Other Current Assets and Other Assets\nThe components of Prepaid expenses and other current assets were as follows at December 31:\nThe components of Other assets were as follows at December 31:\n11.\nAccrued and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued and other current liabilities consisted of the following components at December 31:\n91\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n12.\nDebt\nLong-term loans, notes and other debt, net of unamortized discount, debt issuance cost and cumulative fair value hedging adjustments, consisted of the following at December 31:\n92\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nFair value hedging adjustments associated with the fair value hedge accounting of our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps for the applicable periods are as follows:\nFair value adjustments are recognized in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nShort-term loans, notes and other debt consisted of the following at December 31:\nAggregate maturities of debt during the next five years are $\n899\nmillion in 2024, which includes $\n775\nmillion that remains outstanding under our\n5.75\n% Senior Notes due 2024, $\n498\nmillion in 2025, $\n554\nmillion in 2026, $\n892\nmillion in 2027, $\n1\nmillion in 2028 and $\n8,699\nmillion thereafter.\nLong-Term Debt\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility—\nOur $\n3,250\nmillion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Senior Revolving Credit Facility”), which expires in November 2026, may be used for dollar and euro denominated borrowings. The facility has a $\n200\nmillion sub-limit for dollar and euro denominated letters of credit, a $\n1,000\nmillion uncommitted accordion feature, and supports our commercial paper program. In May 2023, we amended our Senior Revolving Credit Facility to update the interest rate benchmark to reference the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) rather than the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Borrowings under the facility bear interest at either a base rate, SOFR or EURIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin. Additional fees are incurred for the average daily unused commitments. At December 31, 2023, we had\nno\nborrowings or letters of credit outstanding and $\n3,250\nmillion of unused availability under this facility.\n93\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe facility contains customary covenants and warranties, including specified restrictions on indebtedness and liens. Additionally, we are required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio (calculated as the ratio of total net funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, both as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) financial covenant\n3.50\nto 1.00. In the event an acquisition meeting certain thresholds is consummated we can elect to increase the maximum leverage ratio for each of the first six fiscal quarters ending after such acquisition as indicated in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nCovenants and Provisions—\nOur $\n300\nmillion\n8.1\n% guaranteed notes due 2027, which are guaranteed by LyondellBasell Industries Holdings B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of LyondellBasell Industries N.V., contain certain restrictions with respect to the level of maximum debt that can be incurred and security that can be granted by certain operating companies that are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of LyondellBasell Industries Holdings B.V. These notes contain customary provisions for default, including, among others, the non-payment of principal and interest, certain failures to perform or observe obligations under the Agreement on the notes, the occurrence of certain defaults under other indebtedness, failure to pay certain indebtedness and the insolvency or bankruptcy of certain LyondellBasell Industries N.V. subsidiaries.\nThe indentures governing all other notes contain limited covenants, including those restricting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness secured by significant property or by capital stock of subsidiaries that own significant property, enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions with respect to any significant property or enter into consolidations, mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets.\nWe may\nredeem some of our notes\nat any time in whole, or from time to time in part, prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)\n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (discounted at the applicable treasury yield or comparable government bond rate plus their respective basis points) on the notes to be redeemed. Some of our notes may also be redeemed prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price equal to\n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. Certain notes are also redeemable upon certain tax events.\nFurther, our Senior Notes due 2024 may be redeemed and repaid, in whole at any time or in part from time to time prior to the date that is\n90\ndays prior to the scheduled maturity date of the notes at a redemption price equal to\n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a premium for each note redeemed equal to the greater of\n1.00\n% of the then outstanding principal amount of the note and the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the principal amount of the note at maturity plus (ii) all required interest payments due on the note through maturity (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such redemption date plus\n50\nbasis points; over (b) the outstanding principal amount of the note. These notes may also be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the date which is\n90\ndays prior to the final maturity date of the notes, at a redemption price equal to\n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we are in compliance with our debt covenants.\nGuaranteed Notes due 2033—\nIn May 2023, LYB International Finance III, LLC (“LYB Finance III”), a wholly owned finance subsidiary of LyondellBasell Industries N.V., issued $\n500\nmillion of\n5.625\n% guaranteed notes due 2033 (the “2033 Notes”) at a discounted price of\n99.895\n%. Net proceeds from the sale of the notes totaled $\n495\nmillion, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\n94\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe 2033 Notes are the first green financing instruments we have issued related to our green financing framework. Net proceeds from the sale of the 2033 Notes are being used to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, new or existing eligible green projects in the areas of circular economy, renewable energy, pollution prevention and control, and energy efficiency. As of December 31, 2023, we have allocated approximately $\n195\nmillion of proceeds towards qualifying projects. This includes approximately $\n155\nmillion related to new eligible green projects in 2023 with the remaining allocated to existing eligible green projects in 2022 and 2021. Pending the full allocation of the net proceeds, any portion that has not been allocated to eligible green projects will be managed in accordance with our normal liquidity management practices.\nGuaranteed Notes due 2023\n—In July 2023, we repaid the $\n425\nmillion remaining of outstanding principal on our\n4.0\n% guaranteed notes due 2023.\nDebt Extinguishment Costs\n—In 2021, in conjunction with the redemptions of certain of our outstanding notes, we recognized $\n130\nmillion of debt extinguishment costs which are reflected in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The debt extinguishment costs include $\n150\nmillion paid for make-whole premiums and non-cash charges of $\n16\nmillion for the write-off of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by a gain of $\n36\nmillion resulting from the write-off of the cumulative fair value hedge accounting adjustments.\nShort-Term Debt\nU.S. Receivables Facility—\nOur U.S. Receivables Facility, which expires in June 2024, has a purchase limit of $\n900\nmillion in addition to a $\n300\nmillion uncommitted accordion feature. This facility provides liquidity through the sale or contribution of trade receivables by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries to a wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary on an ongoing basis and without recourse. The bankruptcy-remote subsidiary may then, at its option and subject to a borrowing base of eligible receivables, sell undivided interests in the pool of trade receivables to financial institutions participating in the facility (“Purchasers”). The sale of the undivided interest in the pool of trade receivables is accounted for as a secured borrowing in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are responsible for servicing the receivables. We pay variable interest rates on our secured borrowings. Additional fees are incurred for the average daily unused commitments. In May 2023, we amended our U.S. Receivables Facility to update the interest rate benchmark to reference SOFR rather than LIBOR. In the event of liquidation, the bankruptcy-remote subsidiary’s assets will be used to satisfy the claims of the Purchasers prior to any assets or value in the bankruptcy-remote subsidiary becoming available to us. This facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $\n200\nmillion. Performance obligations under the facility are guaranteed by LyondellBasell Industries N.V. The term of the facility may be extended in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The facility is also subject to customary warranties and covenants, including limits and reserves and the maintenance of specified financial ratios. Under the terms of the U.S. Receivable Facility we are required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio consistent with the terms of the Senior Revolving Credit Facility as discussed above. At December 31, 2023, there were\nno\nborrowings or letters of credit outstanding and $\n900\nmillion unused availability under the facility.\nCommercial Paper Program\n—We have a commercial paper program under which we may issue up to $\n2,500\nmillion of privately placed, unsecured, short-term promissory notes (“commercial paper”). This program is backed by our $\n3,250\nmillion Senior Revolving Credit Facility. Proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. At December 31, 2023, we had\nno\noutstanding borrowings of commercial paper.\nPrecious Metal Financings\n—We enter into lease agreements for precious metals which are used in our production processes. Precious metal borrowings are classified as Short-term debt or Long-term debt, other, based on the maturities of the lease agreements.\nWeighted Average Interest Rate\n—At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our weighted average interest rate on outstanding Short-term debt was\n1.9\n% and\n3.7\n%, respectively.\n95\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAdditional Information\nDebt Discount and Issuance Costs—\nAmortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs resulted in amortization expense of $\n9\nmillion, $\n14\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is included in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOther Information\n—LYB International Finance B.V., LYB International Finance II B.V., and LYB International Finance III, LLC (“LYB Finance subsidiaries”) are wholly owned finance subsidiaries of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. Any debt securities issued by LYB Finance subsidiaries will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by LyondellBasell Industries N.V., and no other subsidiaries of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. guarantees these securities. Our unsecured notes rank equally in right of payment to each respective finance subsidiary’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness and to all of LyondellBasell Industries N.V.’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. There are no significant restrictions that would impede LyondellBasell Industries N.V., as guarantor, from obtaining funds by dividend or loan from its subsidiaries.\n13.\nLeases\nOperating Leases—\nThe majority of our leases are operating leases. We lease storage tanks, terminal facilities, land, office facilities, railcars, pipelines, barges, plant equipment and other equipment. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our Operating lease assets were $\n1,529\nmillion and $\n1,725\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Operating lease liabilities totaled $\n1,769\nmillion and $\n1,854\nmillion of which $\n360\nmillion and $\n344\nmillion, respectively, are current and recorded in\nAccrued and other current liabilities\n. These values were derived using a weighted average discount rate of\n3.8\n% and\n3.4\n% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSubstantially all of our operating leases have remaining lease terms of\n20\nyears or less and have a weighted-average remaining lease term of\n9\nyears. Certain lease agreements include options to renew the lease, at our discretion, for approximately\n1\nyear to\n20\nyears and do not materially impact our operating lease assets or operating lease liabilities.\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023, are as follows:\nOperating lease costs were $\n570\nmillion, $\n536\nmillion and $\n418\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn connection with the planned exit from the refinery business, announced in April 2022, we recognized accelerated lease amortization costs of $\n110\nmillion and $\n91\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is included in operating lease cost. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n96\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of Operating lease liabilities totaled $\n447\nmillion, $\n423\nmillion and $\n406\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Leased assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities totaled $\n312\nmillion, $\n248\nmillion and $\n822\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have entered into operating leases, with an undiscounted value of $\n148\nmillion, primarily for buildings that have not yet commenced. These leases which will commence in 2024 and 2025, have lease terms ranging from\n2\nto\n12\nyears.\n14.\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nWe are exposed to market risks, such as changes in commodity pricing, interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility related to these exposures, we selectively enter into derivative contracts pursuant to our risk management policies.\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n—The following table summarizes financial instruments outstanding for the periods presented that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n97\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe financial instruments in the table above are classified as Level 2. We present the gross assets and liabilities of our derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFinancial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n—The following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our Short-term precious metal financings and Long-term debt:\nThe financial instruments in the table above are classified as Level 2. Our other financial instruments classified within Current assets and Current liabilities have a short maturity and their carrying value generally approximates fair value.\nDerivative Instruments:\nCommodity Prices\n—We are exposed to commodity price volatility related to purchases of various feedstocks and sales of our products. We use over-the-counter commodity swaps, options and exchange traded futures contracts to manage these risks, including through cash flow hedging relationships.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments:\nInterest Rates\n—We are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed-rate debt and expose us to the risk that we may need to refinance debt at higher rates. Fluctuations in interest rates also impact interest expense from our variable-rate debt. We use forward-starting interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk that benchmark rates will increase in connection with future financing activities. We also use interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by effectively converting it to variable-rate debt. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n98\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding interest rate derivative instruments:\nForeign Currency Rates\n—We have significant worldwide operations. The functional currencies of our operating subsidiaries are primarily the U.S. dollar and the euro. We enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our designated functional currencies that create foreign currency exposure. We enter foreign currency contracts to economically hedge foreign currency risk related to recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of such forward and swap contracts are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and offset, in part, currency remeasurement results. In the past, we have entered euro-denominated debt that was designated as a net investment hedge. Other (expense) income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income reflected foreign currency losses of $\n34\nmillion, $\n14\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe enter foreign currency contracts that are designated as net investment hedges to manage the impacts of foreign currency translation of our net investments in foreign operations. We also enter foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows associated with intercompany debt balances.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments:\n99\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nImpact on Earnings and Other Comprehensive Income (loss)—\nThe following tables summarize the pre-tax effect of derivative and non-derivative instruments recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCI”), the gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI to earnings and additional gains (losses) recognized directly in earnings:\n100\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAmounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for foreign currency contracts designated as net investment hedges recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) or Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were immaterial.\nAs of December 31, 2023, on a pre-tax basis, $\n5\nmillion is scheduled to be reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss as an increase to interest expense over the next twelve months.\nOther Financial Instruments:\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n—At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had marketable securities classified as Cash and cash equivalents of $\n2,432\nmillion and $\n1,191\nmillion, respectively.\n101\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n15. Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits\nWe have defined benefit pension plans which cover employees in the U.S. and various other countries. We also sponsor post-retirement benefit plans other than pensions that provide medical benefits to certain of our U.S., Canadian and French employees. In addition, we provide other post-employment benefits such as early retirement and deferred compensation severance benefits to employees of certain non-U.S. countries. We use a measurement date of December 31 for all of our benefit plans.\nPension Benefits\n—The following tables provide a reconciliation of projected benefit obligations, plan assets and the funded status of our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans:\n102\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consists of the following:\nAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss include the following:\nThe following additional information is presented for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans:\nPension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of assets are summarized as follows:\nPension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of assets are summarized as follows:\n103\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nComponents of net periodic pension costs for our U.S. and non-U.S. plans are as follows:\nIn May 2022, a LyondellBasell sponsored pension plan purchased a group annuity contract from an insurance company to transfer $\n361\nmillion of our outstanding pension benefit obligations related to certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The purchase of the group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. The insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately\n9,000\nU.S. retirees and beneficiaries with no change to their monthly retirement benefit payment amounts. In connection with this transaction, in the second quarter of 2022, we recognized a non-cash pension settlement loss of $\n80\nmillion, reflected in Other (expense) income, net, primarily related to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n104\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe actual and target asset allocations for our plans are as follows:\nWe estimate contributions to our defined benefit plans in 2024 will be $\n43\nmillion and $\n54\nmillion for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, future expected benefit payments by our pension plans which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:\nThe following tables set forth the principal assumptions on discount rates, projected rates of compensation increase and expected rates of return on plan assets, where applicable. These assumptions vary for the different plans, as they are determined in consideration of local conditions.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in determining the net benefit liabilities for our pension plans were as follows at December 31:\n105\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe weighted average assumptions used in determining net benefit costs for our pension plans were as follows:\nThe discount rate assumptions reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled, based on the yields of high-quality long-term bonds where the term closely matches the term of the benefit obligations. We measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that same yield curve to the projected cash flows of the plans. This approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets in our U.S. plans of\n7.25\n% is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment adviser had advised could be expected to be earned over a\nfifteen\nto\ntwenty year\ntime period consistent with the target asset allocation of the plans, historical capital market performance, historical plan performance (since the 1997 inception of the U.S. Master Trust) and a forecast of expected future asset returns. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets in our non-U.S. plans of\n3.57\n% is based on expectations and asset allocations that vary by region. We review these long-term assumptions on a periodic basis.\nActual rates of return may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. Assets are externally managed by professional investment firms over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility in order to meet the benefit obligations of the plans as they come due.\nOur pension plans have not directly invested in securities of LyondellBasell N.V., and there have been no significant transactions between any of the pension plans and the Company or related parties thereof.\nThe pension investments that are measured at fair value are summarized below:\n106\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nCertain non-U.S. plans have investments in a pooled asset portfolio which are treated as a nonparticipating insurance contract. The associated plan assets underlying the insurance arrangement are measured at the cash surrender value, which is derived primarily from an actuarial determination of the discounted benefits cash flows. As such, these assets are considered as using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These defined benefits pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 were valued at $\n492\nmillion and has decreased to $\n474\nmillion at December 31, 2023. The change is due primarily to the reduction of the assets in relation with the increase of the discount rate from 2022 to 2023.\n107\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe fair value measurements of the investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share as of December 31, 2023 are as follows:\n108\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe fair value measurements of the investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share as of December 31, 2022 are as follows:\nOther Post-retirement Benefits\n—We sponsor unfunded health care and life insurance plans covering certain eligible retired employees and their eligible dependents. Generally, the medical plans pay a stated percentage of medical expenses reduced by deductibles and other coverage. Life insurance benefits are generally provided by insurance contracts. We retain the right, subject to existing agreements, to modify or eliminate these benefits.\n109\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of benefit obligations of our unfunded other post-retirement benefit plans:\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:\nAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows:\n110\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe components of net periodic other post-retirement costs are as follows:\nThe following tables set forth the assumed health care cost trend rates for our U.S. and Non-U.S. Plans:\nThe health care cost trend rate assumption does not typically have a significant effect on the amounts reported due to limits on maximum contribution levels to the medical plans.\n111\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe weighted average assumptions used in determining the net benefit liabilities for our other post-retirement benefit plans were as follows:\nThe weighted average assumptions used in determining the net benefit costs for our other post-retirement benefit plans were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023, future expected benefit payments by our other post-retirement benefit plans, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, were as follows:\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\n—In 2023, pension benefits actuarial loss and other post-retirement benefits actuarial gain of $\n146\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion, respectively, are primarily due to changes in discount rate assumption and updated actuarial assumptions. In 2022, pension benefits actuarial gain and other post-retirement benefits actuarial gain of $\n281\nmillion and $\n65\nmillion, respectively, are primarily due to changes in discount rate assumption and updated actuarial assumptions.\nDeferred income taxes related to amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive loss include provisions of $\n90\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDefined Contribution Plans\n—Most employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. countries are eligible to participate in defined contribution plans (“Employee Savings Plan”) by contributing a portion of their compensation. We make employer contributions, such as matching contributions, to certain of these plans. The Company also has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that covers senior management in the U.S. This plan was amended in April 2013 to provide for Company contributions on behalf of certain eligible employees who earn base pay above the IRS annual compensation limit.\n112\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table provides the Company contributions to the Employee Savings Plans:\n16.\nIncentive and Share-Based Compensation\nWe are authorized to grant RSUs, Stock options, PSUs, and other cash and stock awards under our Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The Compensation and Talent Development Committee oversees our equity award grants, the type of awards, the required performance measures and the timing and duration of each grant. The maximum number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the LTIP is\n30,000,000\nshares. Assuming a maximum payout for our PSU awards, there were\n7,778,231\nshares available for issuance as of December 31, 2023.\nTotal share-based compensation expense and the associated tax benefits are as follows:\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards\n—RSUs entitle the recipient to be paid out an equal number of ordinary shares upon vesting. RSUs generally cliff vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.\nThe fair value of RSUs is based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value for RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n93.93\n, $\n96.14\nand $\n104.43\n, respectively. The total fair value of RSUs vested and issued was $\n30\nmillion, $\n20\nmillion and $\n27\nmillion during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity:\n113\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2023, the unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs was $\n42\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.6\nyears.\nStock Option Awards\n—Stock options allow employees the opportunity to purchase ordinary shares of stock in the future at an exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant. The awards generally have a\nthree-year\nvesting period that vests in equal increments on the first, second and third anniversary of the grant date and have a contractual term of\nten years\n. None of the Stock options are designed to qualify as Incentive Stock Options as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe fair value of each Stock option is estimated, based on several assumptions, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The principal assumptions utilized in valuing Stock options include the expected stock price volatility (based on our historical stock price volatility over the expected term); the expected dividend yield; and the risk-free interest rate (an estimate based on the yield of a United States Treasury zero coupon bond with a maturity equal to the expected term of the option).\nThe expected term of Stock options granted is estimated based on the weighted average of historical exercise patterns and the midpoint of the remaining expected life.\nIn 2022, our board of directors declared a special dividend of $\n5.20\nper share to all shareholders as of June 6, 2022. Pursuant to the anti-dilutive provisions under the award agreement, the Compensation Committee authorized the reduction of the exercise price for all outstanding stock options in an amount equal to the special dividends per share. The reduction in exercise price of $\n5.20\nper share for all outstanding stock options was intended to provide an equitable and proportionate adjustment to holders of stock options as a result of the Company’s payment of the special dividend. These adjustments did not result in incremental expense.\nThe weighted average fair value of Stock options granted and the assumptions used in estimating those fair values are as follows:\nThe following table summarizes Stock option activity:\n114\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of Stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n8\nmillion, $\n6\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the unrecognized compensation cost related to Stock options was $\n6\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.4\nyears. During 2023, cash received from the exercise of Stock options was $\n25\nmillion and the tax benefit associated with these exercises was $\n2 million\n.\nPerformance Share Units Awards\n—A target number of PSUs is granted to participants at the beginning of a\nthree-year\nperformance period. Final payout of awards, which can range from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of target shares granted, is determined and paid after the performance period. These awards are settled in shares of common stock, and each unit is equivalent to\none\nshare of our common stock.\nThe payout for PSUs granted will be equally based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to our peers and a performance metric. The fair value of the portion of the award that vests based on TSR is estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation. For the other portion of the award, the fair value is determined at the end of each reporting period based on our stock price and the number of shares expected to vest.\nThe weighted average fair value and the assumptions used in estimating those fair value using a Monte-Carlo simulation are as follows:\nThe following table summarizes PSU activity assuming payout at 100% of target shares:\nThe total fair value of PSUs vested during 2023 was $\n24\nmillion paid out at\n100\n% of target shares. As of December 31, 2023, the unrecognized compensation cost related to PSUs was $\n36\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.8\nyears.\n115\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\n—We have an Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) which allows participants to purchase our stock at a\n10\n% discount on the lower of the fair market value at either the beginning or end of the purchase period. As a result of the\n10\n% discount and the look-back provision, the ESPP is considered a compensatory plan under generally accepted accounting principles. Total expense related to our ESPP was $\n4\nmillion in 2023 and $\n3\nmillion in both 2022 and 2021.\n17.\nIncome Taxes\nLyondellBasell Industries N.V. is tax resident in the United Kingdom pursuant to a mutual agreement procedure determination ruling between the Dutch and United Kingdom competent authorities and therefore subject solely to the United Kingdom corporate income tax system. LyondellBasell Industries N.V. has little or no taxable income of its own because, as a holding company, it does not conduct any operations. Through our subsidiaries, we have substantial operations world-wide. Taxes are paid on the earnings generated in various jurisdictions where our subsidiaries operate.\nThe Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex legal and tax regulatory environments and is subject to taxes in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We monitor tax law changes and the potential impact to our results of operations. There continues to be increased attention on the tax practices of multinational companies, in particular in the U.S. and Europe where we operate. In 2020, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released Pillar One and Two proposals focused on taxing rights and minimum taxes where we operate, including the United Kingdom. On July 11, 2023, as part of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2023, legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom which introduced an Income Inclusion Rule, known locally as the multinational top-up tax, and domestic minimum top-up tax. This legislation is applicable to periods after December 31, 2023. We continue to assess and monitor legislative changes, however, we do not expect the Pillar Two impact to be material based on the legislation enacted at this stage.\nThe significant components of the provision for income taxes are as follows:\n116\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nSince the proportion of U.S. revenues, assets, operating income and associated tax provisions is significantly greater than any other single taxing jurisdiction within the worldwide group, the reconciliation of the differences between the provision for income taxes and the statutory rate is presented on the basis of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of\n21\n% as opposed to the United Kingdom statutory tax rate of\n25\n%. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 is\n19.1\n%.\nOur effective income tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, changes in pre-tax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates, changes in valuation allowances, changes in foreign exchange gains/losses, the amount of exempt income, changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions and changes in tax laws.\nThe following table reconciles the expected tax expense (benefit) at the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the total income tax provision as calculated:\nOur return to accrual adjustments in 2021 primarily include the tax benefits associated with an election made in 2021 to retroactively step-up certain Italian assets to fair market value and the impact of certain retroactive elections made with respect to the CARES Act in the U.S.\nOur exempt income primarily includes interest income, export incentives, and equity earnings of joint ventures. Interest income earned by certain of our subsidiaries through intercompany financings is taxed at rates substantially lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Export incentives relate to tax benefits derived from elections and structures available for U.S. exports. Equity earnings attributable to the earnings of our joint ventures, when paid through dividends to certain European subsidiaries, are exempt from all or portions of normal statutory income tax rates. We currently anticipate the favorable treatment for interest income, dividends, and export incentives to continue in the near term; however, this treatment is based on current law.\n117\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe deferred tax effects of tax loss, credit and interest carryforwards (“tax attributes”) and the tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements, reduced by a valuation allowance where appropriate, are presented below.\nBalance sheet classification is presented in the following table:\nDeferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain equity joint ventures and subsidiaries of $\n77\nmillion and $\n86\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, have been provided. The Company intends to permanently reinvest approximately $\n550\nmillion of our non-U.S. earnings. Repatriation of these earnings to the U.S. in the future could result in a tax impact of approximately $\n60\nmillion.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had total tax attributes available in the amount of $\n1,438\nmillion and $\n1,103\nmillion, respectively, for which a deferred tax asset was recognized at December 31, 2023 and 2022 of $\n307\nmillion and $\n210\nmillion, respectively.\n118\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe scheduled expiration of the tax attributes and the related deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance, as of December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nThe tax attributes are primarily related to operations in the United States, United Kingdom, France and The Netherlands. The related deferred tax assets by primary jurisdictions are shown below:\nTo fully realize these net deferred tax assets, we will need to generate sufficient future taxable income in the countries where these tax attributes exist during the periods in which the attributes can be utilized. Based upon projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the attributes can be utilized and/or temporary differences are expected to reverse, management believes it is more likely than not that $\n229\nmillion of these deferred tax assets at December 31, 2023 will be realized.\nAs of each reporting date, we consider the weight of all evidence, both positive and negative, to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary for each jurisdiction’s net deferred tax assets. We place greater weight on historical evidence over future predictions of our ability to utilize net deferred tax assets. We consider future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, and taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under applicable law, as well as available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to ensure realization of the net deferred tax asset.\n119\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nA summary of the valuation allowances by primary jurisdiction is shown below, reflecting the valuation allowances for all the net deferred tax assets, including deferred tax assets for tax attributes and other temporary differences.\nDuring 2023, valuation allowance accruals did not have a material impact to our effective tax rate. During 2022, we had some reductions in our tax attributes with offsetting valuation allowances which did not impact the effective tax rate.\nTax benefits totaling $\n288\nmillion, $\n271\nmillion and $\n327\nmillion relating to uncertain tax positions were unrecognized as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:\nThe majority of the uncertain tax positions, if recognized, will affect the effective tax rate. During 2023 and 2021, our effective tax rate included tax expense of $\n21\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion, respectively, related to fluctuations in uncertain tax positions. During 2022, our effective tax rate included a net tax benefit of $\n74\nmillion related to fluctuations in uncertain tax positions. The 2022 movement included a $\n91\nmillion non-cash tax benefit to our effective tax rate as a reduction for tax positions of prior years.\nIt is reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitations, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to approximately $\n70\nmillion.\nWe recognize interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Income tax expense includes expenses of interest and penalties of $\n11\nmillion, $\n1\nmillion and $\n25\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $\n52\nmillion, $\n41\nmillion, and $\n40\nmillion, respectively.\n120\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world, and our tax returns are periodically audited or subjected to review by tax authorities. We are currently under examination in a number of tax jurisdictions. As a result, there is an uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements. Positions challenged by the tax authorities may be settled or appealed by us.\nA summary of the years open to examination for our primary jurisdictions is summarized below.\n18.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\n—We have various purchase commitments for materials, supplies and services incidental to the ordinary conduct of business, generally for quantities required for our businesses and at prevailing market prices. These commitments are designed to ensure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements. Additionally, we have capital expenditure commitments, which we incur in our normal course of business.\nFinancial Assurance Instruments\n—We have obtained letters of credit, performance and surety bonds and have issued financial and performance guarantees to support trade payables, potential liabilities and other obligations. Considering the frequency of claims made against the financial instruments we use to support our obligations, and the magnitude of those financial instruments in light of our current financial position, management does not expect that any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have not experienced any unmanageable difficulties in obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for our current operations.\nEnvironmental Remediation\n—Our accrued liabilities for future environmental remediation costs at current and former plant sites and other remediation sites totaled $\n124\nmillion and $\n127\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the accrued liabilities for individual sites range from less than $\n1\nmillion to $\n25\nmillion. The remediation expenditures are expected to occur over a number of years, and not concentrated in any single year. In our opinion, it is reasonably possible that losses in excess of the liabilities recorded may have been incurred. However, we cannot estimate any amount or range of such possible additional losses. New information about sites, new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies, could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in our accrued environmental liability included in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities:”\n121\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nIndemnification\n—We are parties to various indemnification arrangements, including arrangements entered into in connection with acquisitions, divestitures and the formation and dissolution of joint ventures. Pursuant to these arrangements, we provide indemnification to and/or receive indemnification from other parties in connection with liabilities that may arise in connection with the transactions and in connection with activities prior to completion of the transactions. These indemnification arrangements typically include provisions pertaining to third party claims relating to environmental and tax matters and various types of litigation. As of December 31, 2023, we had not accrued any significant amounts for our indemnification obligations, and we are not aware of other circumstances that would likely lead to significant future indemnification obligations. We cannot determine with certainty the potential amount of future payments under the indemnification arrangements until events arise that would trigger a liability under the arrangements.\nAs part of our technology licensing contracts, we give indemnifications to our licensees for liabilities arising from possible patent infringement claims with respect to certain proprietary licensed technologies. Such indemnifications have a stated maximum amount and generally cover a period of\n5\nto\n10\nyears.\nLegal Proceedings—\nWe are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including but not limited to, matters involving contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury and property damage. We vigorously defend ourselves and prosecute these matters as appropriate.\nOur legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor legal proceedings in which we are a party. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial, mediation or other resolution. We regularly assess the adequacy of legal accruals based on our professional judgment, experience and the information available regarding our cases.\nBased on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, we do not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against us will have a material adverse effect upon our operations, financial condition or Consolidated Financial Statements.\n122\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n19.\nShareholders’ Equity and Redeemable Non-controlling Interests\nShareholders’ Equity\nDividend Distributions\n—The following table summarizes the dividends paid to common shareholders in the periods presented, including the special dividend that our board of directors declared in May 2022:\nShare Repurchase Authorization\n—In May 2023, our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to\n34.0\nmillion ordinary shares, through November 19, 2024 (“2023 Share Repurchase Authorization”), which superseded any prior repurchase authorizations. The timing and amount of these repurchases, which are determined based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors, may be executed from time to time through open market or privately negotiated transactions. The repurchased shares, which are recorded at cost, are classified as Treasury stock and may be retired or used for general corporate purposes, including for various employee benefit and compensation plans.\nIn May 2022, our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to\n34.0\nmillion ordinary shares, through November 27, 2023 (“2022 Share Repurchase Authorization”), which superseded any prior repurchase authorizations.\nIn May 2021, our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to\n34.0\nmillion ordinary shares through November 28, 2022 (“2021 Share Repurchase Authorization”), which superseded our prior repurchase authorizations.\n123\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes our share repurchase activity for the periods presented:\nTotal cash paid for share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n211\nmillion, $\n420\nmillion and $\n463\nmillion, respectively. Cash payments made during the reporting period may differ from the total purchase price, including commissions and fees, due to the timing of payments.\nOrdinary Shares\n—The changes in the outstanding amounts of ordinary shares are as follows:\nTreasury Shares\n—The changes in the amounts of treasury shares held by the Company are as follows:\n124\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\n—The components of, and after-tax changes in, Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are presented in the following table:\n125\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe amounts reclassified out of each component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows:\nAmortization of defined pension items are included in the computation of net periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRedeemable Non-controlling Interests\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had\n113,075\nand\n113,471\nshares of redeemable non-controlling interest stock outstanding, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\n396\nand\n1,903\nshares were redeemed for less than a $\n1\nmillion and approximately $\n2\nmillion, respectively. There were\nno\nshare redemptions during 2021.\nIn February, May, August and November 2023, we paid cash dividends of $\n15.00\nper share to our redeemable non-controlling interest stock shareholders of record as of January 15, 2023, April 15, 2023, July 15, 2023, and October 15, 2023, respectively. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, these dividends were $\n7\nmillion for each year.\n126\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n20.\nPer Share Data\nBasic earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of certain stock option and other equity-based compensation awards. Our unvested restricted stock units contain non-forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents and are considered participating securities. We calculate basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method.\nEarnings per share data is as follows:\n127\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n21.\nSegment and Related Information\nOur operations are managed by senior executives who report to our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker. Discrete financial information is available for each of the segments, and our Chief Executive Officer uses the operating results of each of the operating segments for performance evaluation and resource allocation.\nThe activities of each of our segments from which they earn revenues and incur expenses are described below:\n•\nOlefins and Polyolefins-Americas\n(“O&P-Americas”). Our O&P-Americas segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene.\n•\nOlefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia, International\n(“O&P-EAI”). Our O&P-EAI segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene, and polypropylene.\n•\nIntermediates and Derivatives\n(“I&D”). Our I&D segment produces and markets propylene oxide and its derivatives; oxyfuels and related products; and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer, acetyls, ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol.\n•\nAdvanced Polymer Solutions\n(“APS”)\n.\nOur APS segment produces and markets compounding and solutions, such as polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics, masterbatches, engineered composites, colors and powders.\n•\nRefining\n. Our Refining segment refines heavy, high-sulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the U.S. Gulf Coast into refined products, including gasoline and distillates.\n•\nTechnology\n. Our Technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts.\nOur chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA as the primary measure for reviewing profitability of our segments, and therefore, we have presented EBITDA for all segments. We define EBITDA as earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.\n“Other” includes intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations, such as foreign exchange gains or losses and components of pension and other post-retirement benefit costs other than service costs. Sales between segments are made primarily at prices approximating prevailing market prices.\n128\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nSummarized financial information concerning reportable segments is shown in the following tables for the periods presented:\n129\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nA reconciliation of EBITDA to Income from continuing operations before income taxes is shown in the following table for each of the periods presented:\nThe following assets are summarized and reconciled to consolidated totals in the following table:\n130\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nLong-lived assets include Property, plant and equipment, net, Intangible assets, net and Equity investments, see Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following long-lived assets data is based upon the location of the assets:\nSegment Structure Changes and Related Goodwill Impairment—\nEffective January 1, 2023, our\nCatalloy\nand polybutene-1 businesses were moved from our APS segment and reintegrated into our O&P-Americas and O&P-EAI segments. As a result of the reallocation of goodwill and the change in both fair value and carrying value among reporting units, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $\n252\nmillion in the first quarter of 2023 in our APS segment. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the structure changes and related impairment charge.\nEuropean PO Joint Venture Impairment—\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n192\nmillion related to our European PO Joint Venture, which is included in the operating results for our I&D segment. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge.\nHouston Refinery Operations—\nAfter thoroughly analyzing our options, we determined that exiting the refining business no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025 is the best strategic and financial path forward for the Company. Our exit from the refining business progresses our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, and the site’s prime location gives us more options for advancing our future strategic objectives, including circularity.\nCosts incurred since our decision to exit the refining business through December 31, 2023 were $\n521\nmillion. Our estimate of total exit costs, inclusive of costs incurred to date, range from $\n550\nmillion to $\n1,050\nmillion. We intend to proceed with an orderly shut-down and do not expect to recognize these charges all at once, but rather over time. We do not anticipate any material cash payments related to the exit of the refinery business to be made in 2024.\nCosts incurred for the planned exit from the refinery business are as follows:\n131\nLYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nIn subsequent periods, we expect to incur additional costs primarily consisting of accelerated amortization of operating lease assets of $\n10\nmillion to $\n60\nmillion, personnel costs of $\n20\nmillion to $\n95\nmillion and other charges of $\n40\nmillion to $\n90\nmillion.\nIn connection with the planned exit from the refinery business, we recorded liabilities for asset retirement obligations of $\n259\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The asset retirement obligations we recorded require significant judgment and are subject to changes in the underlying assumptions. We estimate that the Houston refinery’s asset retirement obligations are in the range of $\n150\nmillion to $\n450\nmillion.\nOperating results for our Refining segment include a non-cash impairment charge of $\n624\nmillion recognized in 2021. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding impairment charge.\nDisposition of Australian Facility—\nIn the second quarter of 2022 we sold our ownership interest in our PP manufacturing facility located in Geelong, Australia, LyondellBasell Australia (Holdings) Pty Ltd, for consideration of $\n38\nmillion. In connection with this sale, we assessed the assets of the disposal group for impairment and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value less costs to sell. As a result, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2022 of $\n69\nmillion in the operating results of our O&P-EAI segment. The fair value measurement for the disposal group is based on expected consideration and classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The charge is reflected as Impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n132"
