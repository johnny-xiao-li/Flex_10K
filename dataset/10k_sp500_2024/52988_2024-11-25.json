    "text": "At Jacobs, our foundation guides us to create a more connected and sustainable world.\nWe are challenging today to reinvent tomorrow – delivering outcomes and solutions for the world’s most complex challenges. With a team of approximately 45,000, we provide end-to-end services in advanced manufacturing, cities & places, energy, environmental, life sciences, transportation and water. From advisory and consulting, feasibility, planning, design, program and lifecycle management, we are creating a more connected and sustainable world.\nWhether tackling water scarcity, aging infrastructure, access to life-saving therapies or sophisticated cyberattacks, we take on some of the world’s biggest challenges, bringing a different way of thinking to everything we do. We channel our creativity, agility and our domain expertise to create value for our clients and society.\nOver the last eight years, Jacobs has been on a transformation journey, starting with a re-emphasis on business excellence, our culture and brand, and evolving our portfolio to become a science-based consulting and advisory solutions provider focused on delivering some of the world’s most complex sustainability, critical infrastructure and advanced manufacturing challenges. This transformation included acquiring a 65% stake in PA Consulting Group Limited (\"PA Consulting\") in fiscal 2021. Acquisitions of BlackLynx and StreetLight further positioned us as a leader in high-value critical infrastructure and technology-enabled solutions.\nWe began trading under the new ticker symbol “J” on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2019, and in March 2021 our Global Industry Classifications Standard code changed to Research & Consulting Services. Our Focus 2023 Transformation Office drove further innovation, delivering value-creating solutions for our clients and leveraging an integrated digital and technology strategy to improve our efficiency and effectiveness, ultimately freeing up valuable time and resources for reinvestment in our people.\nBoldly Moving Forward\nPage 4\nIn March 2022, Jacobs launched a three-year strategy, building on our success over the preceding three years to take advantage of a new lens crafted from the incredible pace of change in the world and in our markets. We are focused now on broadening our leadership in high growth sectors aligned with long-term secular trends, such as infrastructure renewal and investment, and the global transition to more sustainable ways of living.\nOur strategy is driven by our visionary purpose of creating a more connected, sustainable world, applying our values and delivering on our brand promise of “Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow.” To help us challenge the accepted and shape the new standards our future needs, our three growth accelerators — Climate Response, Consulting & Advisory and Data Solutions services — create connections between the global market trends, our client solutions and our company purpose. Our growth accelerators are delivering significant value for our clients, positioning Jacobs for high-margin growth while advancing sustainability and social value in our communities.\nOur\nClimate Response\naccelerator focuses on the end-to-end solutions we co-create with clients in energy transition, decarbonization, adaptation and resilience, and regenerative and nature-based climate solutions. Today our clients are facing a rapidly changing world - navigating multifaceted challenges such as the increasing pace of technological change, budget and supply chain limitations, global climate change events and complex geopolitical conditions. Through our\nConsulting & Advisory\ncapabilities, we deepen our involvement with our clients to help them conceptualize, shape and realize their future.\nOur\nData Solutions\naccelerator harnesses our data and digital capabilities, products and tools to\nhelp our clients operate more efficiently in a safe environment and capitalize on their data more than ever before. We invest in technology-enhanced and AI solutions to help clients find better, safer and more agile ways of working. We provide solutions in data analytics and insights, digital architecture, advisory and transformation, software development and cybersecurity and operational technology.\nPrior to the Separation Transaction, the Company's four operating segments were comprised of its two global lines of business (\"LOBs\"): Critical Mission Solutions (\"CMS\") and People Places and Solutions (\"P&PS\"), its business unit Divergent Solutions (\"DVS\") and its majority investment in PA Consulting. After the Separation, we reorganized P&PS and our remaining DVS businesses into a more streamlined operating model, Infrastructure & Advanced Facilities (\"I&AF\"), which enables our collective business teams to collaborate more horizontally. Our CMS LOB and portions of DVS which were included in the separation are now reported as discontinued operations.\nOur next strategy will build upon the foundation laid by our current strategy and will be outlined at our next Investor Day in 2025.\nOur Values in Action\nJacobs' Ethics and Code of Conduct are rooted in our values and provide the standards and support to help us successfully navigate issues, make the right decisions and conduct our business with the integrity that reflects our heritage and ethical reputation. We hold our suppliers and business partners to the same standards.\nPage 5\nOur purpose is to create a more connected, sustainable world. We know that through our client solutions and the way we operate our business we can prepare our world for the complex, interconnected global challenges it faces, while positively impacting what is possible today and in the future. PlanBeyond® integrates sustainability throughout our operations and client solutions — planning beyond today for a more sustainable future.\nWe recognize our greatest opportunity for impact is through our client solutions, and we are focused on how our clients deliver positive impact and build resilience. To enable this, we offer wide-ranging sustainability capabilities, including global, cross-market expertise in decarbonization & greenhouse gas management; adaptation & resilience; sustainable built environments; social value & equity; nature positive solutions; and energy transition. We are continually adapting PlanBeyond to manage risk, seize opportunity and create positive outcomes and will share our updated PlanBeyond priorities on our website in fiscal 2025.\nDriving positive impact\nThrough our client portfolio and our own operations, we focus on creating positive social and economic impacts while protecting the environment and improving resilience.\nClimate Response is one of three growth accelerators within our fiscal 2022 to 2024 Company Strategy – aligning positive societal impact with long-term business growth. One of our key ambitions is to achieve net zero across the value chain by 2040. Our net-zero target is approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, and our carbon neutrality status is in line with the international standard PAS 2060. As part of our Carbon Neutrality Commitment, we achieved 100% low-carbon electricity, and we became carbon neutral for our operations and business travel in 2020. By 2025, we aim for 65% of our purchased goods and services supplier spending to go to those with science-based targets. Our Climate Action Plan will be updated to a Climate Transition Plan in 2025.\nWe have invested in technology to enhance virtual collaboration and help mitigate business travel and employee commuting carbon emissions. We also invested in tools and partnerships to help our people consider when business travel is essential and make more sustainable choices when it is necessary.\nOur digital solutions help our clients with critical project sustainability decisions by assessing climate risks, carbon impacts, and system vulnerabilities. In fiscal 2025, we will deploy our Evolve tool, which generates recommendations to embed sustainability in all Jacobs’ projects to enhance their positive impact and resilience.\nTransparency and accountability\nBusinesses worldwide are experiencing an increase in stakeholder expectations, expanding sustainability regulations and reporting requirements, and greater demand for corporate transparency and accountability. We report our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance annually, following the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and informed by Global Reporting Initiative standards.\nLaunched in fiscal 2023, Jacobs’ Sustainability Linked Bonds (SLBs) further reflect how we are incorporating sustainability into the Company's financing strategy, with the SLBs' interest rate underpinned by two Key Performance Indicators – one linked to Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities (UN SDG 5 and UN SDG 10) and the other to Climate Action (UN SDG 13).\nShaping Tomorrow’s Communities\nAround the world, we work with our clients, partners and supply chains to create solutions that positively impact how people live, move and thrive in the world – driving a more equitable distribution of benefits for communities.\nPage 6\nWe invest in local communities globally, collaborating with charities and not-for-profit organizations to make a positive impact and live our values. Through Collectively℠, our global giving and volunteering program, employees are empowered to engage with charities and community organizations aligned with our values and strategic causes. We provide employee benefits for donation matching, grant nominations, paid volunteer time and volunteer rewards. We support communities devastated by events including natural and climate-related disasters, water security and scarcity, and the impacts of conflicts around the world. Our employees drive further impact through our science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education and engagement programs enabling sustainability learning among young people.\nIn fiscal 2024, we donated over $3.2 million to 2,600+ charities across 23 countries. Our people tracked approximately 18,000 volunteer hours including nearly 9,000 STEAM volunteer hours.\n(1)\nSocial Value and Equity Advisory in our Client Solutions\nWe integrate social value and equity considerations into our client solutions. We help clients realize social value opportunities through their projects and services by embedding and measuring social, economic and environmental benefit generation in what they do. Our blueprint for creating social value through infrastructure investment enables us to help clients contribute to a more inclusive economy and equitable society.\nSocial value is a fast-evolving field, and its successful delivery requires a wide range of specialisms. Our fully owned subsidiary Simetrica-Jacobs specializes in social value, wellbeing research and impact evaluation – measuring, quantifying and monetizing impacts to help directly inform both investment decisions and delivery models, and ensuring impact is generated where it is needed most. Simetrica-Jacobs deploys internationally endorsed methods set out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and government-produced guidelines, including the U.K. Government’s HM Treasury Green Book.\nWe help clients understand how they can transform local, city and regional decision-making – identifying innovative, inclusive and ethical investments that will drive social change, spread prosperity and meet the growing challenges facing communities.\n(1) This data includes Jacobs' continuing and discontinued operations (excluding PA Consulting).\nWe maintain agile and disciplined capital deployment\nM&A and Divestitures\nConsistent with our profitable growth strategy, Jacobs pursues acquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and other transactions to maximize long-term value by continuing to reshape our portfolio to higher value solutions and accelerating profitable growth strategy. The Company has recently made the following acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures:\n•\nOn September 27, 2024, Jacobs completed the previously announced Reverse Morris Trust transaction pursuant to which (i) Jacobs first transferred its Critical Mission Solutions business (“CMS”) and portions of the Divergent Solutions (“DVS”) business (referred to herein as the Cyber & Intelligence business (“C&I”) and together with CMS referred to as the “SpinCo Business”), to Amazon Holdco Inc., a Delaware corporation, which has been renamed Amentum Holdings, Inc. (“SpinCo”) (the “Separation”), (ii) Jacobs effectuated a spin-off of SpinCo by distributing 124,084,108 shares of SpinCo common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “SpinCo Common Stock”) by way of a pro rata distribution to its shareholders such that each holder of shares of Jacobs common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the “Jacobs Common Stock”) was entitled to receive one share of SpinCo Common Stock for each share of Jacobs common stock held as of the record date, September 23, 2024 (the “Distribution”), and (iii) finally, Amentum Parent Holdings LLC merged with and into SpinCo, with SpinCo surviving the merger (the “Merger” and together with the Separation and the Distribution, the “Separation Transaction”). The surviving entity of the Transaction is now an independent public company with common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “AMTM” (“Amentum”).\n•\nOn February 4, 2022, Jacobs acquired StreetLight Data, Inc. (\"StreetLight\"). StreetLight is a pioneer of mobility analytics which uses its data and machine learning resources to shed light on mobility and enable users to solve complex transportation problems.\n•\nOn November 19, 2021, Jacobs acquired BlackLynx, Inc. (\"BlackLynx\"), a provider of high-performance software, to complement Jacobs' portfolio of digital solutions.\nPage 7\n•\nOn March 2, 2021, Jacobs completed the strategic investment of a 65% interest in PA Consulting, a UK-based leading innovation and transformation consulting firm.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company repurcha\ns\ned $402.7 million in shar\nes.\nShareholder Dividends\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Com\npany paid dividends of $0.29 per share in the first, second, third and fourth quarters.\nPage 8\nOperating Segments\nThe services we provided to our markets in fiscal 2024 fall into the following two operating segments: 1) Infrastructure & Advanced Facilities and 2) our majority investment in PA Consulting.\nFor additional information regarding our segments, including information about our financial results by segment and financial results by geography, see Note 20 -\nSegment Information\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInfrastructure & Advanced Facilities (I&AF)\nIn fiscal 2024, Jacobs' Infrastructure & Advanced Facilities line of business provided end-to-end solutions for our clients’ most complex challenges related to climate change, energy transition, connected mobility, buildings and infrastructure, integrated water management and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. In doing so, we combine deep experience in the following end-markets - Critical Infrastructure, Water & Environmental and Life Sciences & Advanced Manufacturing.\nOur core skills revolve around consulting, planning, architecture, design, engineering, infrastructure delivery services\nincluding project, program and construction management and long-term operation of facilities. Solutions are delivered as standalone professional service engagements, comprehensive program management partnerships, and selective progressive design-build and construction management at-risk delivery services. Increasingly, we use data science and technology-enabled expertise to deliver positive and enduring outcomes for our clients and communities.\nOur clients include national, state and local governments in the U.S., Europe, U.K., Middle East, and Asia\nPacific, and multinational and local private sector clients throughout the world.\nPA Consulting (PA)\nJacobs invested in a 65% stake in PA Consulting in March 2021, the company that is bringing ingenuity to life. PA Consulting accelerates new growth ideas from concept, through design and development and to commercial success, and revitalizes organizations, building leadership, culture, systems and processes to make innovation a reality. PA Consulting's global team of approximately 4,000, which includes strategists, innovators, designers, consultants, digital experts, scientists, engineers and technologists work across seven sectors: consumer and manufacturing, defense and security, energy and utilities, financial services, government, health and life sciences, and transport to make a positive impact alongside the clients it supports, bringing ingenuity to life.\nPage 9\nPA Consulting has a diverse mix of private and public sector clients. Private sector clients include global household names like Unilever, and start-ups like PulPac, which converts plant fibers into sustainable packaging to reduce single-use plastic. From sustainable airports with Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and enhanced home security with ADT, to resilient banking with Bankomat, pioneering medtech with Hubly Surgical, and accelerating the energy transition with Invenergy and energyRe. Public sector clients include the U.K.'s Ministry of Defence, Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration, and Danish Tax Agency.\nIn a fast-moving, complex world, we are deploying the collective strengths of Jacobs and PA Consulting to create significant opportunities for our clients. Alongside Copenhagen Metro – one of the most advanced public transport systems in Europe – we are providing strategic management and technical services to support its operations and maintenance. We’re also supporting the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, one of the largest national transportation infrastructure investments in the U.S. Drawing on our extensive experience with Louisiana’s critical state infrastructure, we’re developing a comprehensive offshore wind roadmap for the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. that aims to promote the state’s energy independence, diversification and security while developing its workforce and local economy. Supporting the U.K.’s decarbonization and energy security future, we are delivering technical project management support to the U.K. Department for Energy Security & Net Zero’s Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage program, an essential element of the U.K.’s commitment to deliver a net-zero economy by 2050.\nSeparation of Critical Mission Solutions (CMS) and Cyber & Intelligence (C&I)\nOn September 27, 2024, Jacobs Solutions Inc. (\"Jacobs\") completed the previously announced Reverse Morris Trust transaction pursuant to which (i) Jacobs first transferred its Critical Mission Solutions business (“CMS”) and portions of the Divergent Solutions (“DVS”) business (referred to herein as the Cyber & Intelligence business (“C&I”) and together with CMS referred to as the “SpinCo Business”), to Amazon Holdco Inc., a Delaware corporation, which has been renamed Amentum Holdings, Inc. (“SpinCo”) (the “Separation”), (ii) Jacobs then effectuated a spin-off of SpinCo by distributing 124,084,108 shares of SpinCo common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “SpinCo Common Stock”), by way of a pro rata distribution to its shareholders such that each holder of shares of Jacobs common stock, par value $1.00 per share, (the “Jacobs Common Stock”) was entitled to receive one share of SpinCo Common Stock for each share of Jacobs common stock held as of the record date, September 23, 2024 (the “Distribution”), and (iii) finally, Amentum Parent Holdings LLC merged with and into SpinCo, with SpinCo surviving the merger (the “Merger” and together with the Separation and the Distribution, the “Separation Transaction”). The surviving entity of the Separation Transaction is now an independent public company with common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “AMTM” (“Amentum”).\nAs a result of the Separation Transaction, substantially all SpinCo Business-related assets and liabilities have been separated and distributed (the \"Disposal Group\"). The Company determined that the Disposal Group should be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations because their disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on operations and financial results. As such, the financial results of the SpinCo Business are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, current and non-current assets and liabilities of the Disposal Group are reflected as held for spin in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 29, 2023. Further, as the Separation Transaction closed on September 27, 2024, no amounts remained held for spin at the end of fiscal 2024. See Note 14-\nDiscontinued Operations\n.\nPrior to the Separation Transaction, Jacobs’ Critical Mission Solutions line of business provided a full spectrum of solutions for clients to address evolving challenges like digital transformation and modernization, national security and defense, space exploration, digital asset management, the clean energy transition, and nuclear decommissioning and cleanup. Clients included the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the Combatant Commands, the U.S. Intelligence Community, NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE), EDF Nuclear Generation, the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), and the Australian Department of Defence, as well as private sector clients mainly in the aerospace, automotive,\nmotorsports, energy and telecom sectors. Prior to the Separation Transaction, the DVS business unit served as the core foundation for developing and delivering innovative, next-generation cloud, cyber, data and digital technologies. DVS clients included government agencies and commercial clients in the U.S. and international markets. Certain portions of the DVS business were retained and are now part of I&AF.\nPage 10\nSignificant Customers\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government for each of the last three fiscal years:\nGiven the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the U.S. federal government, the loss of U.S. federal government agencies as customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. For more information on risks relating to our government contracts, see Item 1A -\nRisk Factors.\nContracts\nWhile there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake, our contracts generally fall into two broad categories: cost-reimbursable and fixed-price. The following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last three fiscal years:\nIn accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts (including those with the U.S. federal government) are subject to termination at the discretion of the client, which is discussed in greater detail in Item 1A\n- Risk Factors\n. In such situations, our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination.\nCost-Reimbursable Contracts\nCost-reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The profit element may be in the form of a simple mark-up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee, or a combination of a mark-up and a fee. The fee element can also take several forms, including 1) a fixed amount, 2) an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or 3) an incentive fee based on targets, milestones, or performance factors defined in the contract.\nFixed-Price Contracts\nFixed-price contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixed-price” contracts. Under lump sum bid contracts, we typically bid against competitors based on client-furnished specifications. This type of pricing presents certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Additionally, it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients, which is contrary to our relationship-based business model. Accordingly, lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract. In contrast, under a negotiated fixed-price contract, we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client and frequently exists in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project. Thus, although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client, the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us in our services contracts as well as construction. However, because of economies that may be realized during the contract term, both negotiated fixed-price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts. The Company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts. In recent years, most of our fixed-price work has been either negotiated fixed-price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for design and/or project services, rather than turnkey construction.\nPage 11\nCompetition\nWe compete with many companies across the world including technology, consulting and engineering firms. Typically, no single company or companies dominate the markets in which we provide services, and often we partner with our competitors or other companies to jointly pursue projects. AECOM, Tetra Tech, WSP, Arcadis, Bechtel, Arup, Mott MacDonald, Stantec, Parsons, Accenture, Schneider Electric, Mace, AtkinsRealis, Altair, Montrose, Capgemini, Fluor, IBM, Infosys, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, Bain & Company, BCG and McKinsey & Company are some of our competitors. We compete based on the following factors, among others: technical capabilities, reputation for quality, price of services, safety record, availability of qualified personnel, and ability to timely perform work and contract terms.\nOur People and Our Culture\nOur culture and our people driving it are what truly defines Jacobs. Authentic leadership and a commitment to living our core values every day creates a culture of trust, respect and empowerment across our business to help us deliver the best outcomes for all our stakeholders. Together, we deliver extraordinary solutions for a better tomorrow and live by our employee value statement: \"Jacobs. A world where you can.\" Our strategy further connects our people to our purpose and helps us continue to evolve our culture to support, empower and enable our talent to thrive.\nAttracting and Growing our Talent\nJacobs’ success is dependent on our ability to hire, retain, engage and leverage highly qualified employees, across the full spectrum of technical, professional, scientific and consulting disciplines.\nAs of September 27, 2024, we had a workforce of approximately 45,000 people worldwide, including a contingent workforce of approximately 1,900 people. This represents a decrease of 32% in our total workforce year-over-year - reflecting the spin-off of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence government services businesses, where we transitioned approximately a third of our employees to Amentum. Though the separation represented a challenge, we completed the separation while reducing our voluntary employee turnover rate to 9.6% - truly a testament to our strong culture and the commitment of our people. The breakdown of our employees by region is as follows:\nBy fostering learning and unlocking career opportunities for our people, we attract and retain the best talent to deliver for our clients and fuel long-term growth for Jacobs. Our employee programs, global learning resources and technology help our people collaborate, grow and develop careers in a supportive, high-performing workplace.\nPage 12\nOur unique employee experience platform – e3: engage. excel. elevate. – enables our employees to develop through continuous feedback and celebrations, aligning priorities, learning new skills and increasing knowledge. With more than 32,000 training programs, the e3 Learning platform makes learning and development opportunities easily accessible for our people and we have expanded micro learnings directly into the employee inbox based on their development needs.\nOur new Living our Values series is a self-paced, mandatory learning experience on the platform tailored to help our people embody Jacobs' values daily. The modules encompass caring for colleagues, clients and communities while emphasizing our collective responsibility to shape, impact and transform our culture.\nAs we advance our digital and data solutions to help clients work better and safer, we are empowering our people to improve digital skills and leverage resources. We are developing our proprietary AI tool, Jacobs AI, to make our authoritative knowledge more discoverable and usable for our people to enhance and support daily work. We also launched a new training series on sustainability and resilience – with modules tailored to different business areas, offering practical insights and guidance.\nOur global graduate development program and our local apprenticeships equip our next generation of professionals with the skills, networks and knowledge for a successful career at Jacobs. We provide our interns with practical, relevant “real life experience” to help support their professional goals. In fiscal 2024, we welcomed nearly 1,500 graduates, interns and apprentices to our global team.\nOur people can pursue different careers and lifelong professional opportunities at Jacobs. We promote agile careers and continuous development for our employees, supporting a variety of different career paths. As an employer of choice for diverse talent, these programs enable us to bring more innovative thought and solutions into our teams to support our clients.\nHaving established a baseline for our organizational health with a comprehensive Culture Survey in 2021, we conduct shorter, periodic pulse surveys with employees to continually evaluate progress in priority areas and identify new opportunities for growth. We continue to see strong levels of employee engagement throughout our business. In fiscal 2024, we included culture survey questions within our new Living our Values course focused on inclusion and belonging.\nWe foster and encourage robust mentoring. Employees can request a mentor through e3 in our mentor match programs. In addition, our eight Jacobs Employee Networks (JENs) offer mentoring programs that connect members with leaders who understand the unique challenges of their journeys and provide insight and guidance for those looking to elevate their careers.\nFocus on Inclusion and Diversity\nWe continue to grow and nurture our TogetherBeyond\n℠\nculture, our approach to living inclusion every day and enabling diversity and equity globally. Our focus has always been on “inclusion” first, with one of our four values being “We live inclusion.” By creating a culture of inclusion, diversity follows.\nIntegral to our strategy and how our culture continues to evolve, our TogetherBeyond approach supports a workplace where we embrace different perspectives – our people are more creative and innovative as a result, which benefits our clients. We know that if our people feel connected and valued and that they belong, then there is no limit to who they can be and what we can achieve together. Whether connecting through our eight Jacobs Employee Networks (JENs), one of our 220+ Communities of Practice, or in other ways, our people collaborate and drive pivotal initiatives within Jacobs that create an inclusive workplace for our globally diverse employee population.\nWe focus on important topics like equality, conscious inclusion and allyship. In addition to providing training and resources, our employee networks and other internal communities foster meaningful conversations on these topics. Our people help attract new talent, shape our recruitment strategies, and improve our science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) programs and our accessibility practices.\nPage 13\nOur employee networks:\nTangible leadership commitment and accountability help drive our culture at Jacobs. At fiscal year-end 2024, after giving effect to changes to our Board related to the Separation Transaction, our Board's independent directors were 50% diverse (race and gender), and our Executive Leadership Team was 80% diverse, based on self-reported data.\nEach year, our people leaders commit to meaningful inclusion and diversity (I&D) actions. Inclusive behaviors are part of our leaders’ performance reviews, and all leaders at Vice President level and above are encouraged to mentor junior members of staff, including those from diverse backgrounds. This framework supports our essential I&D priorities – such as recruiting and developing veteran talent, ensuring equity for our LGBTQ+ community, and creating an inclusive environment for people living with disabilities. Our female representation at Vice Presidents and above level in fiscal 2024 is 34% and based on merit.\nAn important component of our priorities is our “Be Seen @ Jacobs” data disclosure campaign which allows employees globally to confidentially and voluntarily report their demographic data. This improves our data reporting, giving us a holistic overview of our workforce and helping us identify and address existing pay gaps or inequities.\nAs of September 27, 2024, our U.S. employees had the following race and ethnicity demographics based on self-reported data:\nPage 14\nTotal U.S. diversity (ethnicity & female) was 52% (excludes contingent workers and craft employees).\nAs of September 27, 2024, our global employees had the following gender demographics based on self-reported data:\nIn fiscal 2024, our U.S. university hiring demographics show hires of 41% female, 54% male, and 5% undisclosed or non-binary gender, as well as 43% ethnically diverse employees. Overall U.S. hiring at Jacobs is at 40% for ethnically diverse employees (excludes contingent workers and craft employees) in 2024.\nWe work with small or disadvantaged businesses across the globe, inclusive of minority and veteran-owned businesses.\nOur Employees’ Wellbeing and Resilience\nWe believe in a comprehensive approach to our employees’ resilience that integrates physical, emotional, financial and social wellbeing. Our global wellbeing programs, tools and benefits for our people and their families give them the resources and support they need to be at their best. Origin, our global financial counseling benefit is designed to help our employees manage their finances confidently and be financially resilient. Additionally, our partnership with Carrot brings free fertility healthcare and family-forming benefits for all paths to parenthood and provides support for menopause, low testosterone and more.\nPage 15\nIn fiscal 2024, we partnered with RethinkCare to provide our people with a free parental success solution and neurodiversity training benefit. We also expanded our flexible working arrangements to ensure our people have the time they need to balance commitments. Furthering our commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive workplace, we extended the reach of our Disabilities and Reasonable Adjustment policies to better support differently abled individuals to participate fully in their employment.\nOrganizationally, as global challenges to our security, wellbeing and ability to operate evolve, we stay focused on managing risks effectively and building our resilience by leveraging our Culture of Caring℠ to deliver the best outcomes for our people, the environment and our company. Our BeyondZero® program continues to drive a safer, more secure, healthier, and more resilient future for our people, our communities and the environment. We are proud to have demonstrated safety excellence with another year of zero employee fatalities at work and a total recordable incident rate\n1\nof 0.17, compared to the North American Industry Classification System’s most recently reported\n2\naggregate rate of 0.6.\nWe also support the emotional resilience of our people and communities through Jacobs’ \"One Million Lives\" initiative, where we offer a free, accessible mental health check-in tool and resources enabling users to check their mental health and access proactive strategies for personal mental health development. More than 47,000 OML check-ins have been completed since its launch in December 2020 to fiscal year end 2024. Our e3 Learning platform empowers employees with self-guided learning opportunities in wellbeing and related topics. To support continued mental wellbeing, we have a network of dedicated Positive Mental Health Leads and an employee volunteer community of 1,900 Positive Mental Health Champions, with one in every twenty one employees being an active champion. From early career employees through to senior and executive leaders, these champions promote positive mental health across the organization and are a point of reference for information and resources on where to find mental health support.\nOur business continuity program to assure business delivery and resilience continues to demonstrate its effectiveness in an ever-changing operational environment. Jacobs’ Strategic Risk Analysis program identifies, collects and analyzes threat intelligence and provides reporting for effective guidance and operational and strategic business decision-making. Despite numerous climate-related and other global events, Jacobs has successfully maintained business continuity.\nOur enhanced Global Travel Assistance program in partnership with our Global Assistance & Response provider, International SOS, helps keep our employees safe and healthy while traveling or on assignment outside their home country.\nIn the challenging global circumstances, we stay committed to humanitarian efforts that support natural and climate-related disaster recovery and relief campaigns, water security and scarcity, and the impacts of conflicts around the world. Our employees actively support humanitarian relief through Collectively℠, our global giving and volunteering program, which enables them to engage with charities and community organizations aligned with our values and strategic causes. We provide employee benefits for donation matching, grant nominations, paid volunteer time and volunteer rewards.\n1\nAs of October 30, 2024 and recorded in accordance with OSHA record keeping requirements, but subject to change thereafter due to possible injury/illness classification changes. The TRIR calculation uses the US OSHA formula of ‘Number of Incidents x 200,000 / total number of hours worked in a year’. The 200,000 is the benchmark established by OSHA because it represents the total number of hours 100 employees would log in 50 weeks based on a 40-hour work week.\n2 Cited on September 27th, 2024 via U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - Incidence rates of non-fatal occupational injuries and illnesses by industry and case types, 2023 for NAICS code 54133\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe information required by Paragraph (a), and Paragraphs (c) through (g) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K (except for information required by Paragraph (e) of that Item to the extent the required information pertains to our executive officers) and Item 405 of Regulation S-K is set forth under the caption “Members of the Board of Directors” in our definitive proxy statement to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Regulation 14A within 120 days after the close of our fiscal year and is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe following table presents the information required by Paragraph (b) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K.\nPage 16\nAll of the officers listed in the preceding table serve in their respective capacities at the pleasure of the Board of Directors of the Company.\nMr. Pragada rejoined the Company in February 2016 after serving as President and Chief Executive Officer of The Brock Group since August 2014.

    "text": "We operate in a changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of some of the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n•\nWe engage in a highly competitive business. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n•\nOur results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the award of these contracts and economic conditions. Demand for our services may be impacted by continuing inflation, rising or continued high interest rates, and/or construction costs.\n•\nProject sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. Failure to maintain safe work sites exposes us to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities.\n•\nThe nature of our contracts, particularly any fixed-price contracts, subjects us to risks of cost overruns. We may experience losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or the project experiences delays.\n•\nOur failure to meet performance requirements or contractual schedules could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nThe contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, canceled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily an accurate representation of our future revenues or earnings.\n•\nThe outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and damage our reputation. Our services expose us to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage.\n•\nA reduction in the amount of available governmental funding could materially affect our results of operations.\n•\nWe are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts.\n•\nEmployee, agent or partner misconduct, or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations, could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.\n•\nCybersecurity or privacy breaches, or systems and information technology interruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to contractual penalties, significant financial losses and/or reputational harm.\n•\nOur actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements.\n•\nOur benefit plan expenses and obligations may fluctuate depending on various factors, including inflation, changes in levels of interest rates, and pension plan asset performance.\n•\nOur businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.\n•\nOur continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel while managing the risks associated with sustained remote working arrangements.\n•\nAny harm to our reputation or relationships with government agencies could decrease the amount of business that government agencies do with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nOur focus on new growth areas entails risks, including those associated with new relationships, clients, talent needs, capabilities, service offerings, and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values.\n•\nIf we, or our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments, lose, or experience a significant reduction in, business from one or a few large customers, it could have a material adverse impact on us.\nPage 18\nRisks Related to International Operations\n•\nOur international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies.\n•\nForeign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects.\n•\nOur global presence could give rise to material fluctuations in our income tax rates.\nRisks Related to the Separation Transaction\n•\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation Transaction, and the Separation Transaction may adversely impact our business and results of operation.\n•\nThe Separation Transaction could result in a significant tax liability if the terms of the private letter ruling are not satisfied.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions, Investments, Joint Ventures and Divestitures\n•\nOur use of joint ventures, partnerships and strategic investments in entities exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.\n•\nAn impairment charge on our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n•\nOur business strategy relies in part on acquisitions and strategic investments to sustain our growth and we may make minority investments as well, all of which present certain risks and uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance\n•\nPast and future non-financial environmental, health, and safety-related laws and regulations could impose significant additional costs and liabilities.\n•\nIf we fail to comply with any governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected.\n•\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nRisks Related to Climate Change and ESG\n•\nClimate change and related environmental issues, including market or regulatory responses to climate change, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nWe may be unable to achieve our climate commitments and targets.\n•\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing and conflicting expectations from governmental organizations, clients, investors, suppliers and partners, communities and our employees with respect to our ESG and diversity and inclusion-related practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Credit Markets\n•\nWe rely in part on liquidity from our credit facilities to fund our business. Restrictions in our credit facilities and other indebtedness could adversely impact our business. Our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.\n•\nMaintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully win some contracts.\n•\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase and our net income and cash flows to correspondingly decrease\n.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Corporate Structure\n•\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock.\n•\nThere can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock.\n•\nIn the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership, and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture, the value of stock is subject to fluctuation.\n•\nWe are a holding company. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries. We depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us to fund our operations.\nPage 19\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe engage in a highly competitive business. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe face intense competition to provide technical, professional and construction management services to clients. The markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional, national and multinational companies. The extent and type of our competition varies by industry, geographic area and project type. Our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive procurement process. We are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing, schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services. Competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, which increases the risk that, among other things, we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we have seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the award of these contracts.\nOur revenues depend on new contract awards. Delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such projects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our long-term projected results. It is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex procurement and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals. Since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. Furthermore, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and, as a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project.\nThe uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. In some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. When an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for our services is impacted by economic downturns, reductions in private or government spending and times of political uncertainty.\nWe provide full spectrum technical and professional solutions to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries, including programs for various national, state and local governments, including advanced manufacturing, cities & places, energy, environmental, life sciences, transportation, water and other general industrial and consumer businesses and sectors. These sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty. Consequently, our results have varied, and may continue to vary, depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate.\nUncertain global economic, socioeconomic and political conditions may negatively impact our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects, including their ability to raise capital and pay, or timely pay, our invoices. These factors may also cause our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services. For example, in the public sector, declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. In addition, under such conditions, many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. These conditions may reduce the demand for our services, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPage 20\nAdditionally, uncertain economic, socioeconomic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. We cannot predict the outcome of changing trade policies or other unanticipated socioeconomic or political conditions, nor can we predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients’ markets. In addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, during any such period we may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. Weak economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry, our business may be disproportionately affected by regional conflicts, negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries.\nContinuing inflation and rising interest rates and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts.\nContinuing or renewed inflation and rising interest rates and/or construction costs (including supply chain issues) could reduce the demand for our services. In addition, we bear all of the risk of high inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. Because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 69% during fiscal\n2024\n), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. However, if we continue to experience inflationary pressures, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future, particularly if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent. Therefore, continued or renewed inflation, rising interest rates and/or construction costs and supply chain challenges and/or frustrations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProject sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. Failure to maintain safe work sites by us, the owner or others working at the project site can lead to our employees or others becoming injured, disabled or even losing their lives, and exposes us to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities.\nProject sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes and hazardous and highly regulated materials, in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations. We may be expressly responsible for safety on some project sites, and, accordingly, we have an obligation to implement effective safety procedures at such sites. The failure by us or others working at such sites to implement safety procedures or the implementation of ineffective procedures, or the failure to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures, subjects our employees and others to the risk of injury, disability or loss of life, and subjects us to risk that the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs.\nWe are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective HSE work procedures throughout our organization, including project sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to fines as well as criminal and/or civil liability. In addition, despite the work of our functional groups, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work, equipment or supplies.\nOur safety record is critical to our reputation. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures.\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could suffer harm to our reputation, reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our contracts, particularly any fixed-price contracts, subjects us to risks of cost overruns. We may experience reduced profits or losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or the project experiences delays.\nFor fiscal 2024, approximately 31.1% of our revenues were earned under fixed-price contracts. Both fixed-price and many cost-reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance. For fixed-price contracts, we may benefit from any cost-savings, but we bear greater risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. Fixed-price contracts are established in part on proposed designs, which may be partial or incomplete, cost\nPage 21\nand scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, commodity and other materials pricing and cost and availability of labor (including the cost of any related benefits or entitlements), equipment and materials and other exigencies. Cost overruns can occur, leading to reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project for a variety of reasons, including if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather, supply chain or other delays beyond our control, changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials, our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability or failure to perform, or changes in general economic conditions and inflationary pressures. We may present change orders and claims to our clients, subcontractors and vendors for, among other things, additional costs exceeding the original contract price. If we fail to properly document the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors and vendors, we will likely incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, could result in a loss for a project. These risks are exacerbated for projects with long-term durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs. The occurrence of significant costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to meet performance requirements or contractual schedules could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer. As a result, we often incur significant costs for engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer, which may impact our liquidity. In some circumstances, we may incur penalties if we do not achieve project completion by a scheduled date. In some cases, the occurrence of delays may be due to factors outside of our control, such as due to supply chain shortages.\nOur contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted. Like fixed-price contracts, the expected cost of cost-reimbursable projects is based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts. A portion of the fee is often linked to these estimates and the related final cost and schedule objectives, and if for whatever reason these objectives are not met, the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses.\nThe contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, canceled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily an accurate representation of our future revenues or earnings.\nBacklog represents estimates of the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. As of the end of fiscal 2024, our backlog totaled approximately $21.8 billion. There is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts, including our U.S. government work, are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client, and may be subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided, as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. In the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. Projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. The risk of contracts in backlog being canceled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices.\nIn some markets, there is a continuing trend toward cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. Typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria. If we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past.\nPage 22\nContracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks compared to contracts with private sector clients.\nThe U.S. federal government represented approximately 10% of our total revenue in fiscal 2024. These contracts, which are an important source of our revenue and profit, are subject to additional risks compared to contracts with private sector clients:\n•\nSome of our contracts are long-term government contracts, which are only funded on an annual basis. In addition, public-supported financing, such as state and local municipal bonds, may be only partially raised at the beginning of a program, with additional funding normally only committed as appropriations are made in each fiscal year. If appropriations for funding are not made in subsequent years of a multiple-year contract, we may not be able to realize all of our anticipated revenue and profits from that project. U.S. government shutdowns or any related under-staffing of the government departments or agencies that interact with our business could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders, could limit the government’s ability to effectively progress programs and make timely payments, and could limit our ability to perform on our existing U.S. government contracts and successfully compete for new work. Governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. The U.S. government may also shift its spending focus toward areas in which we do not currently provide services.\n•\nOur contracts with governmental agencies are subject to audit, investigations and proceedings which could result in adjustments to reimbursable contract costs or, if we are charged with wrongdoing, possible temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government programs, and a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties.\n•\nGovernmental agencies may modify, curtail or terminate our contracts at any time prior to their completion and, if we do not replace them, we may suffer a decline in revenue. In addition, for some assignments, the U.S. government may attempt to “insource” the services to government employees rather than outsource to a contractor.\n•\nMost government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process, which may emphasize price over other qualitative factors. The U.S. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive procurement process for each task order issued under a contract. This process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs.\n•\nWe may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities.\n•\nGovernment contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. For example, for contracts with the U.S. federal government, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards, and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices. Government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. This includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations.\n•\nMany of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. If our employees or our facilities are unable to obtain or retain the necessary security clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThese various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by government authorities as well as profit and cost controls, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur services expose us to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage.\nWe provide services that are subject to professional standards and qualifications, including providing services that are based on our professional engineering expertise, as well as our other professional credentials. These services must comply with various professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of such services. Our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. We also issue reports\nPage 23\nand opinions to clients based on our professional expertise, such as issuing opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. While we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, we may be deemed to be responsible for these professional judgments, recommendations or opinions if they are later determined to be inaccurate, or if a catastrophic event or other failure occurs at one of our project sites or completed projects. Any unfavorable legal ruling against us could result in substantial monetary damages, disqualification to perform services in the future, or even criminal violations.\nSuch events could result in significant professional liability, general liability or product liability and warranty or other claims against us that could be highly publicized and have reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. We could also be liable to third parties, including through class actions, even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. Further, even where coverage applies, the policies have limits and deductibles or retentions or quota shares, which could result in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us. In addition, indemnification from clients or subcontractors may not be available. An uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a policy limit, high deductible and/or retention or quota share, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nWe are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business, including litigation inherited through acquisitions. Since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures at any such facility or project can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, and expose us to substantial claims and litigation and investigations relating to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, or pollution and environmental damage. We can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. In many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors and vendors, we agree to retain or assume specified liabilities for damages, penalties, losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. In addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us.\nWith a workforce of approximately 45,000 people globally, we are also party to labor and employment claims in the normal course of business. Certain of these claims relate to allegations of harassment and discrimination, pay equity, denial of benefits, wage and hour violations, whistleblower protections, concerted protected activity, and other employment protections, and may be pursued on an individual or class action basis depending on applicable laws and regulations. Some of such claims may be insurable, while other such claims may not.\nIn addition, claims received from subcontractors or made by us for change orders can be the subject of lengthy negotiations, arbitration or litigation proceedings, which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. Additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant.\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. Pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, criminal liability, professional warranty obligations, default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nPage 24\nUnavailability or cancellation of insurance coverage could increase our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt the management of our business operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage from third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. Catastrophic events, litigation claims, and other market factors can result in decreased coverage limits, coverage that is more limited, increased premium costs or higher deductibles and/or retentions or quota shares. If any of our third-party insurers fail, suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses could increase, and the management of our business operations could be disrupted. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits.\nWe have also elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, retentions, quota shares and limits under these programs. As a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured.\nA reduction in the amount of available governmental funding could materially affect our results of operations.\nHistorically, we have benefited from both domestic and international government investment programs that provide funding for our services, and we expect to continue to benefit from bills such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nWhile spending and stimulus bills are expected to provide funding in many of the markets in which we operate, we may not be able to obtain the expected benefits from these bills or similar bills in the future. In addition, the timing of funding awards under these bills is uncertain. In the United States, the upcoming change in the administration may result in a reduction in the amount of governmental funding available, which could materially affect our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts.\nThird-party subcontractors we hire perform a significant amount of the work performed under our contracts. We also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project will be impaired. If we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies, parts or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, or fails to provide such services, supplies, parts or equipment in accordance with applicable quality standards as required by the contract or regulation, we will be required to source these services, equipment, parts or supplies from other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability and/or could result in claims against us for damages.\nWe are subject to disputes with our subcontractors from time to time relating to, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed, customer concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract. In addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials would likely impact the overall project, which could result in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications.\nIn an uncertain or downturn economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. The inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPage 25\nEmployee, agent or partner misconduct, or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations, could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.\nWe are subject to the risk of misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners, which could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct includes the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial and non-financial reporting, regulations pertaining to export control, environmental laws, employee wages, pay and benefits, and any other applicable laws or regulations. For example, we provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. The precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or acts of misconduct subjects us to the risk of fines and penalties, cancellation of contracts, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting, any of which could damage our reputation, weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCybersecurity or privacy breaches, or systems and information technology interruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to contractual penalties, significant financial losses and/or reputational harm.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to cyber-attacks, other interruptions, or errors and delays in our information technology systems. In the event we experience a cyber event that results in the theft of data or compromises operations, or we otherwise are unable to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could result in the material loss, corruption, or release of data. In addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events, cyber-attacks or disruptions. Any of these or other events could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of personal data and intellectual property and results of operations, as well as those of our clients.\nAs a provider of information technology services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies and a government contractor, we and our service providers, suppliers and subcontractors collect, store, transmit and otherwise process personal, confidential, proprietary and sensitive information, including classified information. As a result, our information technology systems, including those provided by third-party cloud providers or other infrastructure-as-a-service providers, ,which have grown over time, including through acquisitions, have, and will continue to experience threats and cyber-attacks, including unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing and other security breaches, problems and system disruptions, including unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients’ proprietary, classified or other protected information. We are also subject to social engineering attacks which have caused, and may also seek to cause in the future, payments due to or from us to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts, which may not be recoverable by us.\nWhile we have security measures and technology in place designed to protect our and our clients’ proprietary, classified and other protected information, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent all threats to our computer systems. The U.S. federal government has continued to raise concerns about the potential for cyber-attacks generally as a result of heightened geopolitical tension and conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts and the escalating tensions in the Middle East, among others. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks (e.g., AI used to develop malicious code and sophisticated phishing attempts)\n.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently, cyber attacks continue to become more sophisticated and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target. As such, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. Any of these events could damage our reputation, result in significant business interruption, cause us to incur significant liability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPage 26\nWe continuously evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment and information technology systems, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons, including due to the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies and especially as we continue to operate under a hybrid working model under which employees can work and access the Company’s technology infrastructure remotely. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. In addition, our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent globally, the associated risks described above may increase. Given that the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or mitigating harms after such an attack. In addition, laws, regulations, government guidance, and industry standards and practices in the United States and elsewhere are rapidly evolving to combat these threats. We may face increased compliance burdens regarding such requirements with regulators and also incur additional costs for oversight and monitoring of our own systems.\nIn addition, laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of personal data, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), the United Kingdom Data Protection Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, and other emerging U.S. state and global privacy laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs and may require changes to our business practices resulting from the variation of regulatory requirements and increased enforcement frequency. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, including related regulatory enforcement and/or private litigation resulting from a potential privacy breach, could result in governmental investigations, significant fines and penalties, damages from private causes of action, or reputational harm. Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data, we may be unable to transfer personal data of employees and clients in those regions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients.\nOur technology and intellectual property provide us, in certain instances, with a competitive advantage. Although we seek to protect our intellectual property through registration, enforcement, licensing, contractual arrangements, security controls and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could lapse, expire or be invalidated, narrowed in scope, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. Trade secrets are generally difficult to protect. We implement technical and administrative measures to protect our confidential information and trade secrets, including by requiring our employees and contractors be subject to confidentiality and invention assignment obligations, but such measures may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information or otherwise protect our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the U.S. If we are unable to enforce, protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against our intellectual property or us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. Litigation to enforce our intellectual property against third parties, to defend against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, or to determine or challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of intellectual property rights, even if we ultimately prevail, could be costly and could divert our leadership’s attention away from other aspects of our business.\nWe also hold licenses to third-party technology or intellectual property, which may be utilized in our business operations. If we are no longer able to license such technology or intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe may use third-party open source software in our products. Some open source licenses, such as “copyleft” open source licenses, require end-users who distribute software and services that include open source software to also make available all or part of such software’s source code. If our activities were determined to be non-compliant with the terms of any applicable “copyleft” open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release all or part of our proprietary source code for limited or no cost and our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nPage 27\nIf our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. Our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies.\nWe will also need to continue to respond to and anticipate changes resulting from artificial intelligence and other similarly disruptive technologies. If we are not successful in preserving and protecting our intellectual property rights and licenses, including trade secrets, or in staying ahead of developing artificial intelligence technologies, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur clients or other third parties may also provide us with their proprietary technology and intellectual property. There is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment authorities may obtain certain information related to, or rights in or to the intellectual property in, our products or services. This may allow government authorities to disclose such information or license such intellectual property to third parties, including our competitors, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition and operation results.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in technology industries. We may face from time to time, allegations that we or a supplier or customer have violated the rights of third parties, including patent, trademark, and other intellectual property rights. If, with respect to any claim against us for violation of third-party intellectual property rights, we are unable to prevail in the litigation or retain or obtain sufficient rights or develop non-infringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or cost-efficient basis, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAny infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious, are time consuming, divert technical and management personnel, and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease utilizing products or services, or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\nIf we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act, commonly called the Price-Anderson Act (“PAA”), is a U.S. federal law, which, among other things, regulates radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry, including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear related incidents. The PAA provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and U.S. Department of Energy (“DoE”) contractors. The PAA protections and indemnification apply to us as part of our services to the U.S. nuclear energy industry and DoE for new facilities, maintenance, modification, decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear energy, weapons and research facilities.\nWe offer similar services in other jurisdictions outside the U.S. For those jurisdictions, varying levels of nuclear liability protection is provided by international treaties, and/or domestic laws, such as the Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act of Canada and the Nuclear Installations Act of the United Kingdom, insurance and/or assets of the nuclear installation operators (some of which are backed by governments) as well as under appropriate enforceable contractual indemnifications and hold-harmless provisions. These protections and indemnifications, however, may not cover all of our liability that could arise in the performance of these services. To the extent the PAA or other protections and indemnifications do not apply to our services, the cost of losses associated with liability not covered by the available protections and indemnifications, or by virtue of our loss of business because of these added costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPage 28\nOur actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements.\nIn preparing our financial statements, our leadership is required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our leadership include:\n•\nRecognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting;\n•\nEstimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;\n•\nRecognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims;\n•\nCollectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts;\n•\nEstimates of other liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves and reserves necessary for self-insured risks;\n•\nAccruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves;\n•\nValuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions and ongoing assessment of impairment;\n•\nValuation estimates for redeemable noncontrolling interests calculations;\n•\nValuation of stock-based compensation;\n•\nThe determination of liabilities under pension and other post retirement benefit programs; and\n•\nIncome tax provisions and related valuation allowances.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment of long-lived assets or restructuring activities may require us to record a significant charge to earnings.\nOur long-lived assets, including our lease right-of-use assets, equity investments and others, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at the asset group level has resulted in, and could result in additional, impairment of our long-lived assets. Further changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of operations of our business. These changes, including the closure of one or more offices, could result in restructuring and/or asset impairment charges.\nOur benefit plan expenses and obligations may fluctuate depending on various factors, including inflation, changes in levels of interest rates, changes in regulations and pension plan asset performance.\nWe have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. For example, as of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, our defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $82.2 million and $61.5 million, respectively, not including U.S. multiemployer pension plans. See Note 13-\nPension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional disclosure. We may have to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post retirement benefit plans we manage or for which we have contribution or funding obligations (e.g., multiemployer pension plans). If we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we provide health care and other benefits to our employees. In recent years, costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, our cost to provide such benefits could increase, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also a participating employer in various Multi-Employer Pension Plans (\"MEPPs\") associated with some of the work we perform on a union basis, which MEPPs are managed by third party trusts and over which we have no control, including as to how the MEPPs are managed or financial investment decisions are made. If any of these MEPPs is underfunded, we could face the imposition of underfunded liability or withdrawal liability at a materially adverse level.\nPage 29\nWe also continue to monitor changes in global pension regulations, as the complexity of pension laws in the jurisdictions where we sponsor plans (for example in the UK and as highlighted by the recent Virgin Media case) can present financial risks in the event of non-compliance.\nOur businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.\nExtraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or human caused disasters and geopolitical conflicts, could negatively impact our ability to operate. As an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions that may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to work locations in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity.\nWhen making contract proposals, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing to complete the associated projects, as well as assumptions regarding technical issues. However, we may remain obligated to perform our services after any natural or human caused event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. Our profitability may be adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects is in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or human caused catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits.\nOur continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel and corporate leadership professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost. The market for these and other personnel is competitive. From time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise, and in the timeframe, demanded by our clients, or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. Furthermore, some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects. If we were to lose some or all of these personnel, they would be difficult to replace. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and leadership personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects.\nIn addition, in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the Company, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans, which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRemote working arrangements may increase our costs and adversely impact our culture and ability to effectively train our personnel.\nAs many of our employees work remotely, we must continue to adopt techniques and tools to effectively train and integrate new hires and preserve our culture. Failure to effectively train our employees could create challenges for us in maintaining high levels of employee awareness of, and compliance with, our internal procedures and external regulatory compliance requirements, in addition to increasing our recruiting, training and supervisory costs, while failure to preserve our culture for any reason could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy.\nPage 30\nNegotiations with labor unions and possible work actions could disrupt operations and increase labor costs and operating expenses.\nA certain portion of our work force has entered into, and additional portions may in the future enter into, collective bargaining agreements, which on occasion may require renegotiation. The outcome of future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements may not be favorable to the Company in that they may increase our operating expenses and lower our net income as a result of higher wages or benefit expenses. In addition, negotiations with unions diverts management attention and could disrupt operations, which may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, we may have to address the threat of union-initiated work actions, including work slowdowns and strikes. Depending on the nature of the threat or the type and duration of any work action, these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur professional reputation and relationships with government agencies are critical to our business, and any harm to our reputation or relationships with government agencies could decrease the amount of business that governments do with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is earned directly or indirectly from various government agencies. If our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed, our future revenue and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected. Our reputation and relationship with these government agencies is a key factor in maintaining and growing revenue under our government contracts. Negative press reports regarding poor contract performance, employee misconduct, information security breaches, engagements in or perceived connections to politically or socially sensitive activities, or other aspects of our business, or regarding government contractors generally, could harm our reputation. In addition, to the extent our performance under a contract does not meet a government agency’s expectations, the client might seek to terminate the contract prior to its scheduled expiration date, provide a negative assessment of our performance to government-maintained contractor past-performance data repositories, fail to award us additional business under existing contracts or otherwise, and direct future business to our competitors. If our reputation or relationships with these agencies are negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, such actions would decrease the amount of business that the government agency does with us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur focus on new growth areas for our business entails risks, including those associated with new relationships, clients, talent needs, capabilities, service and product offerings, and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values.\nWe are focused on growing our presence in our addressable markets by: expanding our relationships with existing clients, developing new clients by leveraging our core competencies, further developing our existing capabilities and service offerings, creating new capabilities and solutions offerings to address our clients' emerging needs, and undertaking business development efforts focused on identifying near-term developments and long-term trends that may pose significant challenges for our clients. These efforts entail inherent risks associated with innovation and competition from other participants in those areas, potential failure to help our clients respond to the challenges they face, our ability to comply with uncertain evolving legal standards applicable to certain of our offerings, including those in the cybersecurity area, and, with respect to potential international growth, risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions, such as compliance with applicable foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that may impose different and, occasionally, conflicting or contradictory requirements, and the economic, legal, and political conditions in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. As we work to develop new relationships, clients, capabilities, and service and product offerings, these efforts could harm our results of operations due to, among other things, a diversion of our focus and resources and actual costs, opportunity costs of pursuing these opportunities in lieu of others and a failure to reach a profitable return on our investments in new technologies, capabilities, and businesses, including expenses on research and development investments, and these efforts could ultimately be unsuccessful.\nThe needs of our customers change and evolve regularly. Our success depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends; develop technologically advanced, innovative, and cost-effective products and services; and market these products and services to our customers. For example, one of our business strategies is to invest in, develop and promote innovative climate response technologies and solutions in order to meet the demands of our public and private sector clients.\nA misalignment between the technologies and solutions we identify to invest in, develop and promote and our clients’ needs may adversely impact our results of operations and reputation. Although we have strategies to mitigate this risk, we cannot assure you that we will identify the most effective technologies and solutions to invest in, promote or develop. Additionally, as we diversify and expand our product offerings, there is also an increased risk\nPage 31\nthat one or more of our product offerings could fail to meet specifications in a particular application or could be perceived by our customers to contain defects, which could result in our being liable for damages and losses that arise from such products. Products with defects, or which are otherwise incompatible with intended end uses, may also result in us having to recall such products, or provide additional services under the product warranty, which may impact our profitability. A failure of our products and solutions to meet specifications may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur success also depends on our continued access to suppliers of important technologies and components. The possibility exists that our competitors might develop new capabilities or service offerings that might cause our existing capabilities and service offerings to become obsolete. If we fail in our new capabilities development efforts or our capabilities or services fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors, our ability to procure new contracts could be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, with the growth of our U.S. and international operations, we provide client services and undertake business development efforts in numerous and disparate geographic locations, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to effectively serve our clients is dependent upon our ability to successfully leverage our operating model across all of these and any future locations, maintain effective management controls over all of our locations to ensure, among other things, compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and instill our core values in all of our personnel at each of these and any future locations. Any inability to ensure any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards.\nCommodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. For example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, batteries or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. Furthermore, declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices, such as the Middle East. To the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCommodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. Rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. Cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we, or any of our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments, lose, or experience a significant reduction in, business from one or a few large customers, it could have a material adverse impact on us.\nA few clients have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog, or the revenue and/or backlog for our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments\n,\nin any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately 10%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay or cancel their contracts at any time. If we, or any of our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments, lose, or experience a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may use artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and similar technologies in our business, and challenges with properly managing such technologies could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nArtificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and similar technologies (collectively, “AI”), including third-party AI tools, may be enabled by, or integrated into some of our business and solutions. As with many developing technologies, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed or biased. Datasets used to train or develop AI systems may be insufficient, of\nPage 32\ninferior quality, or contain biased information. Additionally, the laws and regulations concerning the use of AI continue to evolve.\nIf the use or integration of AI systems, or the outputs generated by such systems, were determined to be non-compliant (e.g., in relation to intellectual property or data privacy rights), this may result in liability, including legal liability, or adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial condition and results of operations. It is possible that emerging regulations may limit or block the use of AI in our business and solutions or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect or impair the usability or efficiency of our business or services for an extended period of time or indefinitely. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their product development, product offerings, technology and infrastructure products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain our cash at financial institutions, often in balances that exceed federally insured limits.\nThe majority of our cash is held in accounts at U.S. banking institutions that we believe are of high quality. Cash held in depository accounts may at times exceed the $250,000 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. If such banking institutions were to fail, we could lose all or a portion of those amounts held in excess of such insurance limitations. Any material loss that we may experience in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and could materially impact our ability to pay our operational expenses or make other payments. Banking institution failures, or changes in legislation and regulation, may adversely impact other entities that would, in turn, impact us. If our clients, suppliers, insurers, joint venture partners, sureties, or other parties with whom we do business with are affected by issues in the banking industry it may have an adverse impact on our operational and financial performance.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nOur international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies.\nFor fiscal 2024, approximately 31% of our revenue was earned from clients outside the U.S. Our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:\n•\nRecessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as Europe, Asia or other specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries;\n•\nDifficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and operations, including challenges related to logistics, communications and professional licensure of our international workforce;\n•\nUnexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements;\n•\nPotential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, export control and anti-boycott laws and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n•\nPotential non-compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards regarding consumer protection and data use and security, including the General Data Protection Regulation approved by the European Union and the Data Protection Act approved by the United Kingdom;\n•\nLack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights;\n•\nExpropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country;\n•\nRenegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts;\n•\nThe adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions;\n•\nEmbargoes, duties, tariffs or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;\n•\nGeopolitical developments that impact our or our clients’ ability to operate in a foreign country;\n•\nChanges in labor conditions;\n•\nActs of war, aggression between nations, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism;\n•\nThe ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations;\n•\nSocial, political, and economic instability;\n•\nChanges to tax policy;\n•\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n•\nLimitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and\nPage 33\n•\nU.S. government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate.\nThe lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. In addition, military action, geopolitical shifts or continued unrest, particularly in the Middle East, could disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and may also impact the supply or pricing of oil, increase our security costs and cost of compliance with local laws, and present risks to our reputation. Additionally, recent events, including changes in U.S. trade policies and responsive changes in policy by foreign jurisdictions and similar geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, escalating tensions in the Middle East, increasing tensions between the U.S. and China and uncertainty in the E.U., Asia and elsewhere, have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally, and may increase the volatility of global financial markets and the global and regional economies.\nIn addition, our globally connected talent force collaborates to deliver solutions for clients, agnostic of geography. This relies upon client procurement models that are open to global professional service provision. Increased nationalization and heightened “buy-local” policies and regulation could reduce the effectiveness and competitive differentiation enabled by our global delivery model and compound the existing talent shortage in key geographies. To the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in domestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations and policies, changes in statutory tax rates and laws, and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits could adversely affect our business, profitability and reputation.\nOur domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations and policies (including environmental and employment requirements, export/import laws, tax policies, integrated financial/non-financial reporting requirements such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive  and the  Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive in the European Union and other similar legal requirements). Failure to comply with any of the foregoing laws, regulations and policies could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, as well as damage to our reputation. In addition, our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, data security, data privacy and health and safety laws, may exceed our estimates. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation.\nWe are subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions. Accordingly, our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. A material change in the statutory tax rate or interpretation of local law in a jurisdiction in which we have significant operations could adversely impact our effective tax rate and impact our financial results.\nOur tax returns are subject to audit and taxing authorities could challenge our operating structure, taxable presence, application of treaty benefits or transfer pricing policies. If changes in statutory tax rates or laws or audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in tax laws could have an adverse effect on our customers, resulting in lower demand for our products and services.\nForeign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects.\nWe are a global professional services company, with our international operations accounting for approximately 31% of our annual revenue in fiscal 2024. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have reduced, and could continue to reduce, the U.S. dollar value of sales, earnings and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results, reported financial condition and the U.S. dollar value of our backlog. Our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar.\nPage 34\nIn addition, fluctuations in exchange rates may increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in international markets. While we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. We may attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. These actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. The governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries.\nOur global presence could give rise to material fluctuations in our income tax rates.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, or an ultimate determination that the Company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated costs.\nSome of our services are performed in high-risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war, terrorism or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. Despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot always guarantee the safety of our personnel. Acts of terrorism, threats of armed conflicts and human rights violations in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel or the cancellation of contracts, and in some instances, cause damage to our reputation. The loss of key employees or contractors, whether as a result of injury, death or attrition, may adversely impact our business operations.\nRisks Related to the Separation Transaction\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation Transaction, including with respect to our remaining ownership interest.\nOn September 27, 2024, we completed the separation of our Critical Mission Services business and a portion of our Divergent Solutions business (the “Separated Business”) in the Separation Transaction. We have expended significant management time and resources in connection with the Separation Transaction and may incur significant additional expenses and challenges in connection with the Separation Transaction. Although we believe that the Separation Transaction will enhance our long-term value by allowing us to dedicate financial and human capital resources to pursue appropriate growth opportunities and execute our strategic plan, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation of our businesses, and the Separation Transaction may adversely affect our business. The Separation Transaction resulted in two independent, publicly traded companies, each of which is now a smaller, less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the Separation Transaction, which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions. Additionally, a potential loss of synergies from the Separation Transaction could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAdditionally, any contractual arrangements between us and the Separated Business may be on less favorable terms than the prior intercompany arrangements from which we previously benefited, may not efficiently mitigate dis-synergies arising from the Separation Transaction, and may be inadequate to provide for the ongoing operation and growth of our business, preserve continuity for clients, deliver key capabilities or otherwise provide for continued cooperation in relevant business areas.\nIf we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result\nPage 35\nof the Separation Transaction, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAs a result of the Separation Transaction, we hold 7.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Amentum. An additional amount of approximately 4.5% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Amentum (the \"contingent consideration\") has been placed in escrow, to be released and delivered in the future to us and our shareholders or the former sole equity holder of Amentum, depending on the achievement of certain operating profit targets by the Separated Business. To the extent Jacobs and shareholders become entitled to any portion of the contingent consideration, the first 0.5% of the outstanding shares of Amentum will be released from escrow and delivered to us. Any further contingent consideration to which we and our shareholders may become entitled will be distributed on a pro rata basis to shareholders as of a record date to be determined in the future. Any shares of contingent consideration to which we and our shareholders do not become entitled to receive will be delivered to the former equity holder of Amentum.\nWe cannot predict the trading price of shares of Amentum’s common stock and the market value of the Amentum shares are subject to market volatility and other factors outside of our control.\nWe intend to divest our ownership interest in Amentum within 12 months of the distribution, but there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of such divestiture. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the divestiture, including but not limited to financial market conditions.\nAmentum may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation Transaction.\nIn connection with the Separation Transaction, we and Amentum entered into various transaction agreements, including a transition services agreement and project services agreement. These agreements provide for the performance of certain services by us or Amentum for our benefit of the other party for a period of time after the separation. We rely on Amentum to satisfy its performance obligations under these agreements. If Amentum is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including indemnification obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe Separation Transaction could result in a significant tax liability if the terms of the private letter ruling are not satisfied.\nIn connection with the Separation Transaction, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) stating that the distribution qualified for tax-free treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the opinions of tax advisors received prior to the distribution, if the IRS determines that factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect or if undertakings made to the IRS in connection with the letter ruling request are or have been violated, then we will not be able to rely on the IRS ruling and the potential resulting tax liability to us and our shareholders could be substantial.\nIn general, if the distribution and certain related transactions were determined not to qualify as transactions described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code at a point in the future, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,  each of our shareholders who received Amentum common stock in the distribution would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution, and we generally would recognize taxable gain with respect to the transfer of Amentum common stock in the distribution, which could result in a significant tax to us. Additionally, if one or more persons acquire a 50% or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of Jacobs or Amentum, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution, then, even if the distribution otherwise qualifies as a transaction described in Section 355 of the Code, the distribution may result in a tax liability to us (but not to our shareholders). For purposes of Section 355(e) of the Code, any acquisitions of Jacobs or Amentum stock, directly or indirectly, within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are generally presumed to be part of such a plan, although we may, depending on the facts and circumstances, be able to rebut that presumption.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions, Investments, Joint Ventures and Divestitures\nPage 36\nOur use of joint ventures, partnerships and strategic investments in entities exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.\nAs is common in our industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. This situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients.\nFurther, we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners, including with respect to nonperformance, default, bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance. Our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. If these circumstances occur, we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners. Differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues, which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures. In addition, in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement. If we are not able to enforce our contractual rights, we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities.\nWe participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. In these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. To the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn impairment charge on our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. As of September 27, 2024, we had $4.79 billion of goodwill, representing 40.7% of our total assets of $11.8 billion. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to test goodwill carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis, and whenever events occur, or circumstances change, that indicate impairments could exist, based upon a fair value approach. We also assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indications of impairment are present based on expected future probability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations. We have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter.\nIf our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. If the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. The amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. For a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see Item 7-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nbelow.\nOur business strategy relies in part on acquisitions and strategic investments to sustain our growth. These transactions present certain risks and uncertainties.\nOur business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of, and strategic investments in, other companies, such as our acquisitions of CH2M, BlackLynx and StreetLight and our strategic investment in PA Consulting. These transactions, as well as transactions we may engage in in the future, present a number of risks, including:\nPage 37\n•\nAssumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the transaction was negotiated, such as if the target company failed to comply with U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and/or contractual requirements with clients;\n•\nValuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the target company's business;\n•\nFailure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth opportunities within the anticipated timeframe or at all;\n•\nThe loss of key customers or suppliers, including as a result of any actual or perceived conflicts of interest;\n•\nDifficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;\n•\nDifficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business;\n•\nFor strategic investments in which we do not acquire 100% of the target company, the other equity holders may have various governance rights and minority protections, including consent rights over certain actions taken by the company, and these may result in additional costs, including from continuing to operate the target company on a standalone basis;\n•\nThe effects of diverting leadership’s attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of target companies;\n•\nPotentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations, strategic investments and/or divestitures;\n•\nPotential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or investment or post-closing deterioration in the target company's business;\n•\nDifficulties relating to assimilating the leadership, personnel, benefits, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities;\n•\nDifficulties retaining key personnel of the target company;\n•\nIncreased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities;\n•\nIncreased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial and non-financial (e.g., climate-related) reporting and internal controls;\n•\nThe potential for claims for damages by the sellers of any business if we enter into an acquisition agreement that we do not ultimately consummate, or if disputes arise post-closing relating to post-closing covenants or payment obligations; and\n•\nThe risks discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors that may relate to the activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition.\nWhile we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses and/or insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity, or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses.\nIf our leadership is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy with respect to acquisitions and/or strategic investments, our operating results could be harmed. Moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition or investment targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. Existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions and/or strategic investments. Future acquisitions and/or strategic investments may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all. Acquisitions and/or strategic investments may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures create various business risks and uncertainties during the pendency of the transaction.\nConsummation of any merger, strategic investment or divestiture is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including one or more of the following: (i) due diligence and its associated time and cost commitments, (ii)\nPage 38\nboard and shareholder approval, (iii) regulatory approvals, (iv) the absence of any legal restraint that would prevent the consummation of the transaction, (v) the absence of material adverse conditions which can prevent the consummation of the transaction, and (vi) compliance with covenants and the accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the transaction agreement, among others. One or more of these conditions may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the transaction may not be consummated or may be significantly delayed. In such case, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock may decline, particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be consummated or will be consummated within a particular timeframe.\nFurthermore, most transactions require the Company to incur substantial expense associated with closing and if the transaction is not consummated, we will incur these expenses without realizing the expected benefits. The pursuit of the transaction will also require management attention and use of internal resources that would otherwise be focused on general business operations. In addition, customers’ uncertainty about the effect of the transaction may have an adverse effect on the ability to win customer contracts or could cause existing clients to seek to change existing business relationships. Employee morale due to the uncertainties associated with the transaction could also be negatively affected. Any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating a transaction, including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the transaction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may make minority investments that subject us to risks and uncertainties outside of our control.\nFrom time to time, the Company may make minority investments in the equity securities of companies that we do not control. Minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the minority investment.\nTo the extent we hold only a minority equity interest in a company, we may lack affirmative control rights, which may diminish our ability to influence the company’s affairs in a manner intended to enhance the value of our investment in the company. We could incur losses if the majority stakeholders or the management of the company takes risks or otherwise acts in a manner that does not serve our interests.\nIn addition, we could be subject to reputational harm if the company in which the investment is made makes business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with management or employees of the company in which the investment is made, or its other stockholders.\nIn most cases, the companies in which we make investments will have indebtedness or equity securities or may be permitted to incur indebtedness or to issue equity securities, which rank senior to our investment. We also may make investments in early-stage companies that depend on venture funding and are not profitable. In the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made, holders of debt instruments and securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our investment.\nWe may also enter into separate commercial arrangements with these companies, whether before, concurrently with, or after making a minority investment. In certain cases, the commercial arrangement may be a driving factor behind our investment. We cannot assure you that that the commercial arrangement will further our business strategy as we expected. We may not realize all the economic benefits expected from the commercial agreement or realize the expected return on our investments.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance\nPast and future non-financial environmental, health, and safety-related laws and regulations could impose significant additional costs and liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety-related laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances, and human health and safety. These laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. Violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities.\nPage 39\nVarious U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. These laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. The liability under these laws may be joint and several. We have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. The discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nHealth, safety, and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically, and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. Changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. Failure to comply with any environmental, health, or safety laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, exposes us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with any governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business, including data privacy and security, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import-export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition. For example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires compliance with all export and import laws and regulations. Although we have policies and procedures to comply with U.S. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the Company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts, and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business.\nIn addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which requires us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state and local government permits and approvals. These permits or approvals are subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals subjects us to the risk of penalties or other liabilities, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances; strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Climate Change and ESG\nClimate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPage 40\nClimate change related events, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, freezing conditions, and other natural disasters, may have both immediate and long-term impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks regardless of where we conduct our business. For example, a catastrophic natural disaster could negatively impact any of our office locations and the locations of our customers. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business is critical to our operations. Accordingly, a natural disaster has the potential to disrupt our and our customers’ businesses and may cause us to experience work stoppages, project delays, financial losses and additional costs to resume operations, including increased insurance costs or loss of coverage, legal liability and reputational losses.\nFurther, the risks caused by climate change span across the full spectrum of the markets we serve. Our end-to-end services span advanced manufacturing, cities & places, energy, environmental, life sciences, transportation and water. The direct physical risks that climate change poses to infrastructure through chronic environmental changes, such as rising sea levels and temperatures, and acute events, such as hurricanes, droughts and wildfires, is common to each of these markets. Infrastructure owners could face increased costs to maintain their assets, which could result in reduced profitability and fewer resources for strategic investment. These types of physical risks could in turn lead to transitional risks (i.e., the degree to which society responds to the threat of climate change), such as market and technology shifts, including decreased demand for our services and solutions, reputational risks, such as how our values and practices regarding a low carbon transition are viewed by external and internal stakeholders, and policy and legal risks, such as the extent to which low carbon transitions are driven by the governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate around the globe, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nGrowing public concern about climate change has resulted in the increased focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and climate change issues. Governmental policies designed to address climate change could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, climate legislation across all geographies poses a similar risk to us and our clients as we operate globally. However, further policy changes and climate legislation could also increase the overall demand for our services as our clients and partners work to comply with such policies, such as by decarbonizing their industries, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and developing integrated and sustainable solutions, which could have a positive impact on our business. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers.\nWe may also incur additional expenses as a result of U.S. and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding GHG emissions, and broader ESG-related factors. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of both climate change and these broader matters.\nWe may be unable to achieve our climate commitments and targets.\nAt Jacobs, we have committed to do our part to help solve the climate crisis by setting ambitious climate commitments and targets, including our goals to remain carbon neutral for our operations and business travel and reach net-zero for our entire value chain by 2040. However, achievement of our climate commitments and targets is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to execute our operational strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes; the availability and cost of alternative fuels, global electrical charging infrastructure, off-site renewable energy and other materials and components; unforeseen design, operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates or requirements relating to GHG emissions, carbon costs or climate-related goals; labor-related regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third party contractors; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions; the actions of competitors and competitive pressures and an acquisition of or merger with another company that has not adopted similar carbon goals or whose progress toward reaching its carbon goals is not as advanced as ours.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our operational strategies and achieve our climate commitments and targets.\nPage 41\nWhile our climate commitments and targets are ambitious, we believe that they are realistic and achievable. We have also developed a roadmap for implementation of our carbon reduction goals and our global emissions reduction trajectory suggests that we continue on a pathway to meet our targets. However, we also recognize that some of our emission reductions over the past few years may have been primarily the result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our roadmap recognizes these anomalies, and we are putting measures in place to establish a going-forward trajectory to attain our commitments. However, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be successful. Failure to achieve our climate commitments and targets could damage our reputation and our customer and other stakeholder relationships. If we are unable to meet our climate commitments and targets and appropriately address sustainability enhancement, we may lose investors, customers, or partners, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our reputation may be negatively affected, and it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing and conflicting expectations from governmental organizations, clients, investors, suppliers and partners, communities and our employees with respect to our ESG and diversity and inclusion-related practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nThere is increased scrutiny from governmental organizations, clients, and employees on companies’ environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) practices and disclosures, including with respect to inclusion and diversity. If our ESG practices, including our goals for inclusion and diversity, do not meet evolving rules and regulations or stakeholder expectations and standards (or if we are viewed negatively based on positions we do or do not take or work we do or do not perform or cannot publicly disclose for certain clients and industries), then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain leading experts, employees and other professionals and our ability to attract new business and clients could be negatively impacted, as could our attractiveness as an investment, service provider, employer, or business partner. Similarly, any failure or perceived failure in our efforts to execute our ESG strategy or our diversity and inclusion strategy and achieve our current or future related goals, targets, and objectives, or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines expected by stakeholders or at all, could also result in similar negative impacts. Organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed rating processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, and unfavorable ratings of our ESG efforts may lead to negative investor sentiment, diversion of investment to other companies, and difficulty in hiring skilled employees. In addition, complying or failing to comply with existing or future federal, state, local, and foreign legislation and regulations applicable to our ESG efforts, which may conflict with one another, could cause us to incur additional compliance and operational costs or actions and suffer reputational harm, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Credit Markets\nWe rely in part on liquidity from our credit facilities to fund our business. Restrictions in our credit facilities and other indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\nWe are currently a borrower under several credit facilities and our subsidiary, Jacobs Engineering Inc., has issued notes pursuant to an indenture with respect to which Jacobs has provided a guarantee. These facilities and indenture contain customary covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to incur certain liens and indebtedness. We are also subject to certain financial covenants in our credit facilities, including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. A breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under one or more of our credit facilities or indentures and limit our ability to do further borrowing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may be prohibited from undertaking actions that are necessary or desirable to maintain or expand our business. Additionally, if it becomes necessary to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, or if we are unable to refinance at all, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates.\nOur business may be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.\nWe depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. Instability in the credit markets in the U.S. or abroad, and continued inflation and rising interest rates could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. This situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our\nPage 42\nexisting indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIn addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. Disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients’ ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients. In addition, clients may be unable to fund new projects, may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in North America, Europe, South America, Australia and Asia. Some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. In addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. Although none of our lenders or the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that such events may occur in the future. If any such events were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access cash, which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts.\nIn line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers. These instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. If a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit, we cannot pursue that project. Historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the Company's credit-worthiness. Because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding, or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. There can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. In addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase and our net income and cash flows to correspondingly decrease.\nBorrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. In the past year, inflation and other factors have resulted in an increase in interest rates generally, which has impacted our borrowing costs. Even though interest rates have moderated in recent months, if interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness referred to above would increase even if the principal amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. We are also currently party to, and in the future, we may enter into additional, interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments, in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nIn addition, our credit facilities reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the primary benchmark rate for our variable rate indebtedness. SOFR is a relatively new reference rate and with a limited history, and changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates. As a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our variable rate indebtedness is difficult to predict.\nWe have also included sustainability-linked key performance indicators (\"KPIs\") in our credit facilities and certain of our senior notes, with KPI targets that include improving gender diversity and, in the case of the senior notes, reducing\nPage 43\nGHG emissions. Failure to achieve such targets could result in an interest rate step up on the debt, which would cause an increase in our debt payment obligations and could negatively impact our reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Corporate Structure\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts, which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock. Fluctuations are caused by a number of factors, including:\n•\nLegal proceedings, disputes and/or government investigations;\n•\nFluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers;\n•\nThe number and significance of projects executed during a quarter;\n•\nUnanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits;\n•\nThe timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments;\n•\nDelays incurred in connection with a project;\n•\nChanges in prices of commodities or other supplies;\n•\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nWeather conditions that delay work at project sites;\n•\nThe timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives;\n•\nThe decision by the Board of Directors to begin or cease paying a dividend, and the expectation that if the Company pays dividends, it will declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future;\n•\nNatural disasters or other crises;\n•\nStaff levels and utilization rates;\n•\nChanges in prices of services offered by our competitors; and\n•\nGeneral economic and political conditions.\nThere can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid, and intend to continue paying, regular quarterly dividends. The declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price.\nIn the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership, and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture, the value of stock is subject to fluctuation.\nOne method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. If we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the Company.\nIn addition, if we receive stock or other equity securities in connection with a sale or divestiture of a business, the value of such stock will fluctuate and/or be subject to trading restrictions. Stock price changes may result from, among other things, changes in the business, operations or prospects of the issuer prior to or following the transaction, litigation or regulatory considerations, general business, market, industry or economic conditions, the ability to sell all or a portion of the stock based on current market conditions, and other factors both within and beyond our control. In addition, if the stock received is valued in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the value of such stock will also fluctuate based on foreign currency rates.\nPage 44\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.\nWe are a Delaware corporation. Certain anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. In addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. For example:\n•\nOnly our Board of Directors can fill vacancies on the board;\n•\nThere are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and\n•\nOur Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares.\nThese types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. Accordingly, shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nWe are a holding company. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries. We depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us to fund our operations.\nWe are a holding company. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries, which are separate and distinct legal entities. Therefore, we are reliant on the operations of our subsidiaries to fund (whether by dividend, distribution or loan) holding company operations, including our ability to pay dividends and service any indebtedness of the holding company. In addition, we cannot assure you that the agreements governing the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments of dividends or other obligations of the holding company. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions or loans to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and monetary transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Furthermore, payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings."

    "text": "We maintain a cybersecurity program, designed to proactively identify, assess, manage, mitigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats. Our Cybersecurity Organization develops, implements, and maintains this program, which is documented in our global cybersecurity policy. The underlying controls of the cybersecurity program are based on recognized best practices and standards for cybersecurity and information technology and is aligned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework (“CSF”) and the International Organization Standardization (“ISO”) 27001 Information Security Management System Requirements. Cybersecurity is an important and integrated part of our enterprise risk management program that identifies, monitors and mitigates business, operational and legal risks. Our cybersecurity risk management process is integrated into our overall risk management process, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the risk management process to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational and financial risk areas.\nWe regularly assess the threat landscape and take a holistic view of cybersecurity risks, with a layered cybersecurity strategy based on prevention, detection and mitigation. Our cybersecurity program maintains assessment protocols for proactively evaluating potential cybersecurity impacts and risks, supported by incident response procedures. We employ systematic processes to manage cybersecurity risks, including through cybersecurity audits, interconnectivity with business networks, system access controls and monitoring, and data back-up and recovery. Our cloud environments undergo continuous assessment, with firewall and backup systems designed to support operational resilience. We employ a Zero Trust Security framework that requires identity verification for network access, complemented by regular system assessments and monitoring. Our security controls include identity management programs, data loss prevention protocols, and threat detection capabilities. Our controls undergo regular review and updates based on threat intelligence, ensuring adaptability to merging threats. Similarly, our incident response program is regularly tested and updated to address emerging threat landscapes. To ensure organization-wide security awareness, cybersecurity training is mandatory and issued to all employees annually. Cybersecurity awareness is also included across other training programs, including our annual Code of Conduct and privacy training programs.\nThird-party risk management is a critical component of our security strategy. We maintain oversight of service providers through a proactive monitoring approach, leveraging a cybersecurity questionnaire and security and privacy\nPage 45\naddenda to our contracts where applicable. We evaluate third party providers for maintenance of effective security management programs, compliance with information handling and asset management protocols, and require prompt notification of known or suspected cyber incidents.\nTo validate our security posture, we engage independent external parties to conduct regular penetration testing and security audits, and to provide cybersecurity consulting services. We maintain ISO 27001 certification for our global enterprise. Additionally, our IT General Controls (ITGC) undergo annual testing through Sarbanes-Oxley audits, which examine security controls relating to system changes, access management, system configurations, and data backup processes.\nOur Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of cybersecurity and information security risk, which it manages as part of our enterprise risk management program. Specifically, the Board is assisted by the Audit Committee and the ESG and Risk Committee, which oversees our cybersecurity risk exposures and the steps taken by management to monitor and mitigate cybersecurity risks, and reports to the Board. Throughout the year, our senior executives, including our Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\"), provide regular briefings to the full Board, the Audit Committee and the ESG and Risk Committee. These presentations cover technology trends, regulatory developments, disclosure requirements, legal issues, policies and practices, threat environment assessments, and ongoing security measures to prevent, detect, and respond to critical threats. The Board, the Audit Committee and the ESG and Risk Committee regularly discuss cybersecurity and information security risks with our senior executives. As part of our cybersecurity governance, we also utilize a Cybersecurity Steering Committee comprised of executive management, operational leaders, and cross-functional teams. Generally, this committee meets quarterly, or more frequently as appropriate, to review, assess and direct decisions related to cybersecurity and information systems matters.\nOur cybersecurity program is led by our CISO, who reports to our Chief Information Officer (CIO). Our CISO is informed about and monitors prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security team, many of whom have decades of experience and hold certifications such as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional or Certified Information Security Manager, and through the use of technological tools and software and engagement with external consultants. Our CISO has extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk and holds the following certifications:  Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), am FINRA Licensed (with a Series 99), and an Oracle Cloud Certified Professional (OCP). Our CISO and CIO regularly report directly to the Board, the Audit Committee and the ESG and Risk Committee on our cybersecurity program and efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate incidents. In addition, in the event of an incident, we intend to follow our incident response procedures that include notification processes to inform senior management and the Board of Directors and provide ongoing updates regarding any such incident until it has been remediated as appropriate.\nOur operations are subject to cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access, system failures, and breaches that could originate from both internal networks and through third-party suppliers and service providers. While we have not experienced a material impact on our business strategy, results of operations and/or financial condition resulting from cybersecurity threats or previous cybersecurity incidents, such events have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition, including by damaging or interrupting access to our information systems or networks, compromising confidential or otherwise protected information, destroying or corrupting data, or otherwise disrupting our operations. We continuously monitor our networks for unauthorized access attempts and maintain defensive measures; however, the dynamic nature of cyber threats means we cannot guarantee prevention of all potential future incidents that could materially impact our business operations, financial condition, or strategic objectives. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we also rely on providers of third-party products, services, and networks, with whom we may share data and services, and who may be unable to effectively defend their digital technologies and services against attack."

    "text": "Page 49\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn order to better understand the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, a reader of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing long-term professional services, engineering and construction-type contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2-\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Accounting for Contracts\nThe Company recognizes engineering, procurement, and construction contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer in accordance with ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n. Contracts that include engineering, procurement and construction services are generally accounted for as a single deliverable (a single performance obligation). In some instances, the Company’s services associated with a construction activity are limited only to specific tasks such as customer support, consulting or supervisory services. In these instances, the services are typically identified as separate performance obligations.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method, based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs. Estimated contract costs include the Company’s latest estimates using judgments with respect to labor hours and costs, materials, and subcontractor costs. The percentage-of-completion method (an input method) is the most representative depiction of the Company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer. Subcontractor materials, labor and equipment and, in certain cases, customer-furnished materials and labor and equipment are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent (e.g., the company integrates the materials, labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer or is otherwise primarily responsible for fulfillment and acceptability of the materials, labor and/or equipment). Under the typical payment terms of our engineering, procurement and construction contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals (e.g., biweekly or monthly) and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing, depending on the contract.\nFor service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time using the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method. In some instances where the Company is standing ready to provide services, the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the service period. Under the typical payment terms of our service contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing, depending on the contract.\nDirect costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts, including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects. The level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors, including the amount of pass-through costs we incur during a period. On those projects where we are acting as principal for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs (and we refer to such costs as “pass-through costs”).\nAccounting for Pension Plans\nThe accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. The actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded status of the respective plans are provided in Note 13-\nPension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPage 50\nThe expected rates of return on plan assets ranged from 5.3% to 7.6% for fiscal 2024 and range from 4.6% to 7.8% for fiscal 2025. We believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2025 reflects the long-term returns expected on the plans’ assets, considering recent market conditions, projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans’ assets, and the expected real rates of market returns. The discount rates used to compute plan liabilities ranged from 3.8% to 6.9% in fiscal 2024 and range from 3.4% to 7.0% in fiscal 2025. These assumptions represent the Company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled.\nChanges in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. For example, if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) at September 27, 2024 was lower or higher by 1.0%, the PBO would have been higher or lower, respectively, at that date by approximately $158.7 million for non-U.S. plans, and by approximately $21.0 million for U.S. plans. If the expected return on plan assets was lower or higher by 1.0%, the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2024 would be higher or lower, respectively, by approximately $13.1 million for non-U.S. plans, and by approximately $2.9 million for U.S. plans. Differences between\nactuarial assumptions and actual performance (i.e., actuarial gains and losses) that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensi\nve income (loss) and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the reasonableness of the actuarial assumptions used.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nIn connection with the PA Consulting investment in March 2021, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interests, representing the interest holders' initial 35% equity interest in the form of preferred and common shares of PA Consulting. The preferred shares are entitled to a cumulative annual compounding 12% dividend based on the outstanding preferred share subscription price. These noncontrolling interest holders have certain option rights to put the preferred and common share interests back to the Company at a value based on the fair value of PA Consulting (the redemption values). The primary inputs and assumptions impacting the fair value of PA Consulting include projections of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and discount rates applied thereto. Additionally, the Company has an option to call the interests for certain individual shareholders in certain circumstances. Because the interests are redeemable at the option of the holders and not solely within the control of the Company, the Company has classified the interests in redeemable noncontrolling interests in the mezzanine section of its Consolidated Balance Sheet at their redemption values. The optional redemption features may become exercisable no earlier than five years from the March 2, 2021 closing date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events.\nThe Company has deemed these interests probable of becoming redeemable in the future and requiring their measurement at the greater of (i) the redemption amount that would be paid if settlement occurred at the balance sheet date, or (ii) the historical value resulting from the original acquisition date fair value plus the impact of any earnings or loss attribution amounts, including dividends.\nThe fair value of the PA Consulting redeemable noncontrolling interest is determined using a combination of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the projected discounted cash flows of PA Consulting. Under the market approach, the fair value is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to PA Consulting, with the fair value estimated based on those companies' valuation multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nLitigation, Investigations, and Insurance\nIn the normal course of business, we make contractual commitments, and on occasion we are a party in litigation or arbitration proceedings. The litigation in which we are involved primarily includes personal injury claims, professional liability claims, and breach of contract claims. We are also routinely subject to investigations and audits.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for most insurable aspects of our business and operations. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits depending upon the type of insurance and include certain conditions and exclusions which insurance companies may raise in response to any claim that the Company brings. We have also elected to retain a portion of certain losses, claims and liabilities that occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs and utilize a number of internal financing mechanisms for these self-insurance arrangements including the operation of certain captive insurance entities. As a result, we may be subject to a future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured. We intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of the contracts which the Company enters with its clients. Our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result, one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise.\nPage 51\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include amounts representing our probable estimated liability relating to such claims, litigation, audits, and investigations. Our estimates of probable liabilities require us to make assumptions related to potential losses regarding our determination of amounts considered probable and estimable.\nThe Company believes, after consultation with counsel, that such litigation, U.S. government contract-related audits, investigations and claims, and income tax audits and investigations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, beyond amounts currently accrued.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. We recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date.\nThe goodwill carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is tested annually for possible impairment, and on an interim basis if indicators of possible impairment exist. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure. In performing the annual impairment test, we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the beginning of the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.\nWe evaluate impairment of goodwill either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or by performing a quantitative assessment. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and circumstances affecting the reporting unit. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and after considering the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will perform a quantitative fair value test.\nU.S. GAAP does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units. Any valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others.\nWe use income and market approaches to test our goodwill for possible impairment which requires us to make estimates and judgments. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units. The Company’s discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) for a peer group of companies representative of the Company’s respective reporting units. Under the market approach, the fair values of our reporting units are determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units; the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies. In assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired, we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated.\nIt is possible that changes in facts and circumstances, judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value, including with respect to market conditions and the economy, could change, resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future. The fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties.\nFor the 2024 fiscal year, we performed a quantitative impairment test of the DVS reporting unit at the beginning of the fourth quarter and determined that the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. For the remaining reporting units, we determined that the fair values significantly exceeded their carrying values and an analysis beyond the qualitative level was not considered necessary.\nIntangible assets with finite lives that arise from business acquisitions are amortized based on the period over which the contractual or economic benefit of the intangible assets are expected to be realized or on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the underlying assets. These primarily consist of customer relationships, contracts and backlog, developed technology and trade names. We assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to overall operations. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss.\nPage 52\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022\n(In thousands, except per share information)\nNote: Earnings per share amounts may not add due to rounding.\nPage 53\n2024 Overview\nNet earnings attributable to the Company from continuing operations for fiscal 2024 were $612.8 million (or $4.79 per diluted share), an increase of $233.7 million, or 61.6%, from $379.1 million (or $3.05 per diluted share) for the prior year. The current year results reflected higher year-over-year operating profit of $16.0 million, which benefited from favorable year-over-year underlying operating results, primarily in the Infrastructure & Advanced Facilities (\"I&AF\") segment, as discussed below in the\nSegment Financial Information\nsection. Further, current year results were favorably impacted by $186.9 million in pre-tax mark-to-market gains associated with our invest\nment in Amentum stock recorded in connection with the Separation Transaction (see Note 14-\nDiscontinued Operations\n).\nThe favorable underlying operating performance was achieved despite higher year over year pre-tax Restructuring and other charges and transaction costs due primarily to expenses incurred relating to the Separation Transaction amounting to $144.2 million (primarily professional services and employee separation costs), compared to fiscal 2023 amounts of $142.5 million mainly associated with the Company's Restructuring and other charges and transaction costs relating to expenses incurred in conjunction with the real estate transformation rescaling initiatives and the PA Consulting restructuring program charges (primarily employee separation costs) and expenses incurred relating to the Separation Transaction (primarily professional services). See Note 17-\nRestructuring and Other Charges.\nNet interest expense was favorable by $8.5 million in the current year compared to the prior year due primarily to the Company's higher levels of cash and lower overall levels of outstanding debt compared to fiscal 2023.\nMiscellaneous net income was favorable by $231.9 million for the current year compared to the corresponding fiscal 2023 amount, due mainly to $186.9 million in pre-tax mark-to-market gains associated with the Company's invest\nment in Amentum stock, as well as\na $35.2 million realized gain on interest rate swaps settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which is further discussed in Note 18-\nCommitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments.\nIncome taxes were higher in the current year by $30.2 million due primarily to $55.8 million tax expense from higher year-over-year pre-tax book income. The overall higher income tax expense was offset by a $61.6 million discrete income tax benefit related to the election to treat an Australian subsidiary as a corporation versus a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, which resulted in the derecognition of a deferred tax liability in fiscal year 2024. Also, a net tax benefit of $39.4 million was recorded in fiscal year 2023 relating to the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions.\nFinally, year-over-year net earnings impacts associated with redeemable noncontrolling interests were lower by $(6.6) million and were attributable mainly to lower after-tax earnings results in our PA Consulting investment compared to the prior year.\nNet earnings attributable to Jacobs from discontinued operations for fiscal 2024 were $193.3 million (or $1.54 per diluted share), a decrease of $93.4 million, or\n32.6%\n, from $286.7 million (or $2.25 per diluted share) compared to the prior year due mainly to higher charges associated with the Separation Transaction in the current year.\nBacklog at September 27, 2024 was $21.8 billion, up $4.0 billion, from $17.8 billion for the prior year primarily driven by new business awards in our Americas business. New prospects and new sales remain strong, and the Company continues to have a positive outlook for many of the industry groups and sectors in which our clients operate.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023\nRevenues for the year ended September 27, 2024 were $11.50 billion, an increase of $0.65 billion, or 6.0%, from $10.85 billion for the prior year. The increase in revenues was due mainly to improved performance of our I&AF business, as well as higher revenues year over year in our PA Consulting business. The I&AF business benefited primarily from stronger performance in its Advanced Facilities and international business operations. Our revenues for fiscal 2024 were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of $77.0 million in our international businesses, as compared to an unfavorable impact of $175.3 million for the last fiscal year.\nPage 54\nGross profit for the year ended September 27, 2024 was $2.83 billion, up $121.9 million, or 4.5%, from $2.71 billion for the prior year. The Company's increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to higher revenues as mentioned above, with slight margin impacts from year over year mix and personnel cost impacts. Our gross profit margins showed consistent trends year over year at 24.6% and 25.0% for the years ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. Overall project mix impacts in our portfolios, personnel costs and utilization trends primarily in the PA Consulting business had mostly offsetting impacts on our overall margin trends year over year.\nSee\nSegment Financial Information\ndiscussion for further information on the Company’s results of operations at the operating segment level.\nSelling, general & administrative expenses for the year ended September 27, 2024 were $2.14 billion, an increase of $105.9 million, or 5.2%, from $2.03 billion for the prior year. The current year's results were impacted by Restructuring and other charges of $163.4 million in separation activities (mainly professional services and employee separation costs) relating to the Separation Transaction in comparison to prior period costs of $61.1 million. Further our SG&A expenses were impacted by slight increases in other department spend and personnel costs. Lastly, SG&A expenses were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of $2.1 million for the year ended September 27, 2024 as compared to favorable impacts of $58.9 million for fiscal 2023.\nNet interest expense for the year ended September 27, 2024 was $134.6 million, a decrease of $8.5 million from $143.1 million for the prior year. The decrease in net interest expense for the fiscal year 2024 was due primarily to the Company's higher levels of cash and lower overall levels of outstanding debt compared to the last fiscal year.\nMiscellaneous income, net for the year ended September 27, 2024 was income of $219.5 million, favorable by $231.9 million as compared to $(12.4) million for the prior year. The increase in income from fiscal 2023 was due primarily to $186.9 million in mark-to-market gains associated with our investment in Amentum stock in connection with the Separation Transaction and a $35.2 million realized gain on interest rate swaps settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nNet earnings attributable to Jacobs from discontinued operations for fiscal 2024 were $193.3 million (or $1.54 per diluted share), a decrease of $93.4 million, or\n32.6%\n, from $286.7 million (or $2.25 per diluted share) for the last year. Included in the current year results from discontinued operations is $98.3 million in costs related to the Separation Transaction and approximately $18 million in pre-tax non-cash charges associated with one-time inventory write downs.\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests including redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended\nSeptember 27, 2024\nof\n$33.0 million\nand\n$40.5 million\nfor the corresponding period last year. The year over year changes were primarily due to lower net earnings results in our PA Consulting investment compared to the prior year periods.\nFiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022\nRevenues for the year ended September 29, 2023 were $10.85 billion, an increase of $1,068.3 million, or 10.9%, from $9.78 billion from fiscal 2022. The increase in revenues was due mainly to improved performance of our I&AF business, as well as higher revenues year over year in our PA Consulting business. The I&AF business benefited primarily from stronger performance in its Advanced Facilities and international business operations. Additionally, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2023 were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $175.3 million in our international businesses, as compared to an unfavorable impact of $277.3 million for the corresponding period last fiscal year.\nGross profit for the year ended September 29, 2023 was $2.71 billion, up $130.9 million, or 5.1%, from $2.58 billion for fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 gross profit was favorable due to higher revenue as mentioned above and impacts from cost reductions associated mainly with first quarter 2023 changes in employee benefit programs, which were partly offset by higher spend in company technology platforms and other personnel and corporate cost increases. Our gross profit margins were approximately 25.0% for the years ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Project mix impacts in our portfolios, higher personnel costs and lower utilization trends primarily in the PA Consulting business impacted our fiscal 2023 margins, partly offset by new program startups won in fiscal 2023.\nSee\nSegment Financial Information\ndiscussion for further information on the Company’s results of operations at the operating segment level.\nPage 55\nSelling, general & administrative expenses for the year ended September 29, 2023 were $2.03 billion, a decrease of $5.7 million, or 0.3%, from $2.04 billion for fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 results were impacted by Restructuring and other charges of $61.1 million in separation activities (mainly professional services and employee separation costs) relating to the Separation Transaction and by higher incentives of $46.2 million. Fiscal 2022 was impacted by the final pre-tax $91.3 million settlement of the Legacy CH2M Matter, net of previously recorded reserves, mentioned above and approximately $27 million in third party recoveries was recorded as receivables reducing SG&A. Fiscal 2023 results were also impacted by decreases in real estate related costs, as well as other department spend decreases due in part to the Company's transformation initiatives. Lastly, SG&A expenses benefited from favorable foreign exchange impacts of $58.9 million for the year ended September 29, 2023 as compared to favorable impacts of $90.7 million for fiscal 2022.\nNet interest expense for the year ended September 29, 2023 was $143.1 million, an increase of $47.2 million from $95.9 million for fiscal 2022.The increase in net interest expense year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year period. The increase was offset in part by $6.3 million net interest benefit during fiscal 2023 related to the release of interest accruals associated with the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions.\nMiscellaneous income (expense), net for the year ended September 29, 2023 was expense of $12.4 million, a decrease of $45.9 million as compared to $33.5 million in income for fiscal 2022. The increase in expense from fiscal 2022 was due primarily to an increase in pension costs associated with higher interest rate impacts in fiscal 2023 along with comparatively unfavorable foreign exchange gains and losses in fiscal 2023. Additionally, fiscal 2022 benefited primarily from a $5.1 million gain related to a lease termination.\nNet earnings attributable to Jacobs from discontinued operations for fiscal 2023 were $286.7 million (or $2.25 per diluted share), a decrease of $3.2 million, or\n1.1%\n, from $289.9 million (or $2.24 per diluted share) for the corresponding prior year period.\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests including redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended\nSeptember 29, 2023\nof\n$40.5 million\nand\n$57.0 million\nfor the corresponding period last year. The year over year changes were primarily due to lower net earnings results in our PA Consulting investment compared to the prior year periods.\nOn February 4, 2022, the Company acquired StreetLight Data, Inc. (\"StreetLight\") and on November 19, 2021, a subsidiary of Jacobs acquired BlackLynx (\"BlackLynx\"). For further discussion, see Note 16-\nOther Business Combinations.\nPage 56\nThe following table reconciles total income tax expense on continuing operations using the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the consolidated income tax expense on continuing operations shown in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and (dollars in thousands):\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company implemented restructuring initiatives relating to the Separation Transaction. The Company incurred approximately $42.0 million and $17.5 million in the years ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively, in pre-tax cash charges in connection with these initiatives. These actions, which are expected to be substantially completed before the end of fiscal 2025, are expected to result in estimated gross annualized pre-tax cash savings of approximately $120 million to $147 million. We will likely incur additional charges under this program through fiscal 2025, which are expected to result in additional savings in future periods.\nDuring third quarter fiscal 2023, the Company approved a plan to improve business processes and cost structures of our PA Consulting investment by reorganizing senior management and reducing headcount. In connection with these initiatives, which are expected to be substantially completed in early fiscal 2025, the Company incurred approximately $6.4 million and $14.3\nmillion in the years ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively, in pre-tax cash charges. These activities are expected to result in estimated gross annualized pre-tax cash savings of approximately $50 million to $65 million.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company implemented restructuring and cost reduction initiatives relating to the formation of the reporting and operating segment, Divergent Solutions, which were substantially completed in fiscal 2023.\nPage 57\nThe Company incurred approximately $6.0 million in pre-tax cash charges in connection with these initiatives during the year ended September 29, 2023. These actions are expected to result in estimated gross annualized pre-tax cash savings of approximately $15.6 million to $19.1 million.\nDuring fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2023, the Company implemented further real estate rescaling efforts that were associated with its fiscal 2020 transformation program relating to real estate. These activities were substantially completed in fiscal 2023. In connection with these efforts, the Company has incurred $45.7 million and $69.7 million in the years ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, in pre-tax mainly non-cash charges. These actions resulted in non-cash savings related mainly to the future amortization of lease right-of-use assets over the remaining lease terms. Additionally, the objective of these initiatives was to create a modern, flexible work platform tailored to employees’ needs due to globalization and digital advances and to create total emissions savings that will be realized as we continue to optimize our real estate footprint.\nRefer to Note 17–\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nfor further information regarding restructuring and integration initiatives.\nPage 58\nSegment Financial Information\nThe following tables present total revenues and segment operating profit for each reportable segment (in thousands) and includes a reconciliation of segment operating profit to total U.S. GAAP operating profit by including certain corporate-level expenses and expenses relating to the Restructuring other charges (as defined in Note 17 -\nRestructuring and Other Charges\n)\nand transaction costs (in thousands).\nIn evaluating the Company’s performance by operating segment, the chief operating decision maker (\" CODM\") reviews various metrics and statistical data for Infrastructure & Advanced Facilities and PA Consulting but focuses primarily on revenues and operating profit. In addition, the Company attributes each segment's specific incentive compensation plan costs to the segments. The methods for recognizing revenue, incentive fees, project losses and change orders are consistent among the segments.\nInfrastructure & Advanced Facilities\nPage 59\nFiscal 2024 vs. 2023\nFiscal 2023 vs. 2022\nPA Consulting\nFiscal 2024 vs. 2023\nFiscal 2023 vs. 2022\nPage 60\nBacklog Information\nBacklog represents revenue we expect to realize for work to be completed by our consolidated subsidiaries and our proportionate share of work to be performed by unconsolidated joint ventures. Because of variations in the nature, size, expected duration, funding commitments, and the scope of services required by our contracts, the amount and timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues includes significant estimates and can vary greatly between individual contracts.\nConsistent with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client, including our U.S. government work. While management uses all information available to determine backlog, at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues.\nBecause certain contracts (e.g., contracts relating to large Engineering, Procurement & Construction (\"EPC\") projects as well as national government programs) can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award, and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over several fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we have presented our backlog on a year-over-year basis, rather than on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis.\nPlease refer to Item 1A-\nRisk Factors\n, above, for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts.\nThe following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in millions):\nBacklog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the U.S. federal government and its agencies totaled approximately $2.4 billion (or 11.1% of total backlog), $2.6 billion (or 14.7% of total backlog) and $2.3 billion (or 13.2% of total backlog) at September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Most of our federal government contracts require that services be provided beyond one year. In general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts).\nWe estimate that approximately $5.71 billion, or 26.2%, of total backlog at September 27, 2024 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year.\nConsolidated backlog differs from the Company’s remaining performance obligations as defined by ASC 606 primarily because of contract change orders or new wins not yet processed and our national government contracts where our policy is to generally include in backlog the contract award, whether funded or unfunded excluding certain option periods while our remaining performance obligations represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Additionally, the Company does not include our proportionate share of backlog related to unconsolidated joint ventures in our remaining performance obligations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt September 27, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.14 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $2.11 billion of available borrowing capacity under our $2.25 billion revolving credit agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). We finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations.\nPage 61\nCash and cash equivalents at September 27, 2024 represented an increase of $373.9 million from $770.9 million at September 29, 2023, the reasons for which are described below. The following table presents selected cash flow information for the respective periods shown:\nOur net cash flow provided by operations of $1.05 billion during fiscal 2024 was favorable by $79.9 million in comparison to the cash flow provided by operations of $974.8 million for the corresponding prior year. The year-over-year increase in cash from operations is due mainly to higher cash generated from net earnings (as adjusted for non-cash income statement charges that reflect favorable net impacts mainly in accrued liabilities, prepaid expenses and other deferred liabilities) and favorable accounts receivable collections, offset in part by lower performance in other net working capital performance primarily due to higher year over year cash income tax payments and payments related to the Separation Transaction.\nOur net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2024 was $127.2 million, compared to cash used for investing of $145.7 million in the prior year, with this change due primarily to decreases in additions to property and equipment in the current year.\nPage 62\nOur net cash used for financing activities for the fiscal year ended 2024 of $751.6 million resulted mainly from $495.3 million direct decrease in reported cash on hand in our SpinCo business deconsolidation, $402.7 million of cash used for share repurchases, and $142.8 million in dividends to shareholders. These uses of cash were offset by $374.9 million in net proceeds from borrowings. Cash used for financing activities in the prior year was $1.09 billion, due primarily to net repayments of borrowings of $616.6 million, cash used for share repurchases of $265.7 million, $128.4 million in dividends paid to shareholders and $58.9 million in net PA Consulting related redeemable noncontrolling interests repurchase and issuance activity.\nAt September 27, 2024, the Company had approximately $164.8 million in cash and cash equivalents held in the U.S. and $980.0 million held outside of the U.S. (primarily in the U.K., India, Canada, the Eurozone, Australia and the Middle East region), which is used primarily for funding operations in those regions. Other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the U.S. (see Note 7-\nIncome Taxes\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the U.S.\nThe Company had $306.2 million in letters of credit outstanding at September 27, 2024. Of this amount, $0.5 million was issued under the Revolving Credit Facility and $305.7 million was issued under separate, committed and uncommitted letter-of-credit facilities.\nIn connection with the Separation Transaction, during the fourth quarter, Jacobs received a cash payment of approximately $911 million from SpinCo which was subsequently used for the repayment of debt, which was inclusive of the outstanding short term 2020 Term Loan Facility totaling $834.9 million. Jacobs is expected to realize additional value through the disposition of its retained equity stake in the combined company within 12 months. Please refer to Note 14 -\nDiscontinued Operations\nfor more details.\nAdditionally, the Company reclassified $870.4 million of debt from long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt in the fourth quarter, associated with the 2021 Term Loan Facility - GBP Portion, which is due on September 1, 2025.\nOn February 6, 2023, the Company refinanced its Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities, and on February 16, 2023, the Company issued $500.0 million in bonds. On August 18, the Company issued $600.0 million in bonds. See Note 9 -\nBorrowings\nfor further discussion relating to the terms of the 5.90% Bonds, th\ne 6.35%\nBonds, the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities following the issuances and refinancing.\nOn April 12, 2022, the Company paid cash of AUD640 million, or approximately $475 million using mid-April 2022 exchange rates, which represented the final settlement of Legacy CH2M Matter. For more information, refer to Note 19-\nContractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations and Insurance\n.\nOn February 4, 2022, the Company acquired StreetLight Data, Inc. (\"StreetLight\"). StreetLight is a pioneer of mobility analytics who uses its data and machine learning resources to shed light on mobility and enable users to solve complex transportation problems. The Company paid total base consideration of approximately $190.7 million in cash and issued $0.9 million in equity and $5.2 million in in-the-money stock options to the former owners of StreetLight. The Company also paid off StreetLight's debt of approximately $1.0 million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition.\nOn November 19, 2021, Jacobs acquired BlackLynx, a provider of high-performance software, to complement Jacobs' portfolio of digital solutions. The Company paid total base consideration of approximately $235.4 million in cash to the former owners of BlackLynx. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company also paid off BlackLynx's debt of approximately $5.3 million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition.\nWe believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected cash requirements for our operations, investing activities including acquisitions, if any, and financing activities such as debt servicing, share buybacks and dividends, for the next twelve months. This is based on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our borrowing capacity and our continuing cash from operations.\nWe were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at September 27, 2024.\nPage 63\nSupplemental Obligor Group Financial Information\nOn February 16, 2023, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jacobs Solutions Inc. (together, the \"Obligor Group\"), completed an offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% Bonds, due 2033 and on August 18, 2023, completed an offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Bonds, due 2028 (the “Bonds”). The Bonds are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company (the “Guarantees”). The Bonds and the Guarantees were offered pursuant to prospectus supplements, dated February 13, 2023 and August 15, 2023, respectively, to the prospectus dated February 6, 2023, that forms a part of the Company and JEGI’s automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File Nos. 333-269605 and 333-269605-01) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, set forth below is the summarized financial information for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between Jacobs and JEGI and (ii) equity in the earnings from and investments in all other subsidiaries of the Company that do not guarantee the registered securities of either Jacobs or JEG. This summarized financial information (in thousands) has been prepared and presented pursuant to Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes\n, (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, provides qualitative and quantitative updates to the Company's effective income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures, among others, in order to enhance the transparency of income tax disclosures, including consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disaggregation by jurisdiction of income taxes paid. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is also permitted. ASU\nPage 64\n2023-09 will be effective for the Company's\nannual fiscal 2026 period\n.\nThe Company has identified and is implementing changes to processes and internal controls to meet the standard’s updated reporting and disclosure requirements.\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting, (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items to reconcile to segment profit or loss, and the title and position of the entity’s CODM.

ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments in this update are required to be applied on a retrospective basis. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for the Company's\nannual fiscal 2025 period.\nThe Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nASU 2023-06,\nDisclosure Improvements\n: Amendments - Codification Amendments in Response to the Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the standard to introduce changes to US GAAP that originate in either SEC Regulation S-X or S-K, which are rules about the form and content of financial reports filed with the SEC. The provisions of the standard are contingent upon instances where the SEC removes the related disclosure provisions from Regulation S-X and S-K. The Company does not expect that the application of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures."

In the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nPlease see the Note 9-\nBorrowings\nin Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on Page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facilities and certain other debt obligations are subject to variable rate interest which could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates. As of September 27, 2024, we had an aggregate of $1.13 billion in outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities. Interest on amounts borrowed under these agreements is subject to adjustment based on the C\nompany’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facilities). Depending on the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Faci\nlities bear interest at a SOFR rate plus a margin of between 0.975% and 1.725% or a base rate plus a margin of between 0% and 0.625% including applicable margins while borrowings denominated in British pounds under these respective facilities bear interest at an adjusted SONIA rate plus a margin of between 0.908% and 1.6580%.\nAdditionally, our Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facilities and 5.90% Bonds due 2033 have interest rates subject to potential increases relating to certain ESG metrics as stipulated in the related agreements and as discussed in Note 9 -\nBorrowings\n. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024,\nin connection with the Separation Transaction,\nthe Company repaid the outstanding USD and GBP portion of the 2020 Term Loan Facility.\nHowever, as discus\nsed in Note 18 -\nCommitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instrument\ns, we have swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $200.0 million in place to convert the variable rate interest-based liabilities associated with a corresponding amount of our debt into fixed interest rate liabilities, leaving $0.93 billion in principal amount subject to variable interest rate risk. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with the Separation Transaction, the Company terminated two interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of $554.7 million. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, we entered into two treasury lock arrangements with an aggregate notional value of $500.0 million, which were settled in second quarter fiscal 2023. See Note 18 -\nCommitments and Conting\nencies and Derivative Financial Instrument\ns.\nFor the year ended September 27, 2024, our weighted average floating rate borrowings that are subject to floating rate exposure were approximately $1.4 billion. If floating interest rates had increased by 1.00%, our interest expense for the year ended September 27, 2024 would have increased by approximately $14.1 million.\nPage 65\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. We follow the provisions of ASC No. 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\nin accounting for our derivative contracts. The Company has $827.3 million\nin notional value of exchange rate sensitive instruments at September 27, 2024. See Note 18 -\nCommitments and\nContingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments\nfor discussion."

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are those controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of September 27, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the Evaluation Date were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining for the Company adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date based on the framework established in\n“Internal Control—Integrated Framework,”\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date was effective.\nThe Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, which audited the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2024, as stated in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPage 66\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nThe Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed or operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met. The design of the Company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints, and that the benefits of such control systems must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions."

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nDescription of Business and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nJacobs Solutions Inc. (\"Jacobs\" or \"the Company\") is a leading global professional services company that designs and deploys technology-centric solutions to solve many of the world’s most complex challenges. The services Jacobs provides to end markets fall into the following\ntwo\noperating segments: Infrastructure & Advanced Facilities and our investment in PA Consulting Group Limited (\"PA Consulting\"). See Note 20-\nSegment Information\n.\nFrom advisory and consulting, feasibility, planning, design, program and lifecycle management, Jacobs provides end-to-end services in advanced manufacturing, cities & places, energy, environmental, life sciences, transportation and water. Jacobs provides its services through offices and subsidiaries located primarily in North America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, New Zealand and Asia. Jacobs provides its services under cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts, with fixed-price contracts comprised mainly of professional services arrangements and in some limited cases, construction.\nThe percentage of revenues realized from each of these types of contracts for the fiscal years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 was as follows:\nBasis of Presentation, Definition of Fiscal Year, and Other Matters\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") and include the accounts of Jacobs Solutions Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates which it controls. On August 29, 2022, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEGI), the predecessor to Jacobs Solutions Inc., implemented a holding company structure, which resulted in Jacobs Solutions Inc. becoming the parent company of, and successor issuer to, JEGI (the \"Holding Company Reorganization\"). Prior to the implementation date, the Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JEGI and its subsidiaries and affiliates which it controlled. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30 (determined on the basis of the number of workdays) and, accordingly, an additional week of activity is added every five-to-six years. Fiscal 2020 included an extra week of activity.\nOn September 27, 2024, Jacobs Solutions Inc. (\"Jacobs\") completed the previously announced Reverse Morris Trust transaction pursuant to which (i) Jacobs first transferred its Critical Mission Solutions business (“CMS”) and portions of its Divergent Solutions (“DVS”) business (referred to herein as the Cyber & Intelligence business (“C&I”) and together with CMS referred to as the “SpinCo Business”), to Amazon Holdco Inc., a Delaware corporation, that was subsequently renamed Amentum Holdings, Inc. (“SpinCo”) (the “Separation”), (ii) Jacobs then effectuated a spin-off of SpinCo by distributing\n124,084,108\nshares of SpinCo common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share (the “SpinCo Common Stock”) by way of a pro rata distribution to its shareholders such that each holder of shares of Jacobs common stock, par value $\n1.00\nper share, (the “Jacobs Common Stock”) was entitled to receive\none\nshare of SpinCo Common Stock for each share of Jacobs common stock held as of the record date, September 23, 2024 (the “Distribution”), and (iii) finally, Amentum Parent Holdings LLC merged with and into SpinCo, with SpinCo surviving the merger (the “Merger” and together with the Separation and the Distribution, the “Separation Transaction”).\nAs a result of the Separation, substantially all SpinCo Business-related assets and liabilities have been separated and distributed (the \"Disposal Group\"). The Company determined that the Disposal Group should be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20,\nDiscontinued Operations\nbecause their disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. As such, the financial results of the SpinCo Business are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings as well as relevant disclosures as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, current and non-current assets and liabilities of the Disposal Group are reflected as held for spin in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 29, 2023 and no amounts remain held for spin as of September 27, 2024. See Note 14-\nDiscontinued Operations\nfor more information.\nF-9\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOn February 4, 2022, the Company acquired StreetLight Data, Inc. (\"StreetLight\"). StreetLight is a pioneer of mobility analytics who uses its data and machine learning resources to shed light on mobility and enable users to solve complex transportation problems. The Company paid total base consideration of approximately $190.8 million in cash and issued $0.9 million in equity and $5.2 million in in-the-money stock options to the former owners of StreetLight. The Company also paid off StreetLight's debt of approximately $1.0 million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition. The Company has recorded its final purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition, which is summarized in Note 16-\nOther Business Combinations.\nOn November 19, 2021, Jacobs acquired BlackLynx, a provider of high-performance software, to complement Jacobs' portfolio of digital solutions. The Company paid total base consideration of approximately $235.4 million in cash to the former owners of BlackLynx. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company also paid off BlackLynx's debt of approximately $5.3 million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition. The Company has recorded its final purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition, which is summarized in Note 16-\nOther Business Combinations.\n2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Accounting for Contracts\nEngineering, Procurement & Construction Contracts, Service Contracts and Software Contracts\nThe Company recognizes engineering, procurement, and construction contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer in accordance with ASC Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n. Contracts which include engineering, procurement and construction services are generally accounted for as a single deliverable (a single performance obligation) and are no longer segmented between types of services. In some instances, the Company’s services associated with a construction activity are limited to specific tasks such as customer support, consulting or supervisory services. In these instances, the services are typically identified as separate performance obligations.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method, based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method (an input method) is the most representative depiction of the Company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer. Subcontractor materials, labor and equipment and, in certain cases, customer-furnished materials and labor and equipment are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent (e.g., the company integrates the materials, labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer or is otherwise primarily responsible for fulfillment and acceptability of the materials, labor and/or equipment). The Company recognizes revenue, but not profit, on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced, fabricated, or constructed for a project. Changes to total estimated contract cost or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level. Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred unless they are expected to be recovered from the client. Project mobilization costs are generally charged to project costs as incurred when they are an integrated part of the performance obligation being transferred to the client. Under the typical payment terms of our engineering, procurement and construction contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals (e.g., biweekly or monthly) and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing, depending on the contract.\nFor service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time using the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method. Service contracts that include multiple performance obligations are segmented between types of services. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. In some instances where the Company is standing ready to provide services, the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the service period. Under the typical payment terms of our service contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing, depending on the contract.\nRevenue for certain contracts related to the sale of software licenses is recognized at a point in time, typically at the time of delivery, in accordance with ASC 606. The software license sale will be treated as a performance obligation separate and distinct from any related service and maintenance.\nF-10\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDirect costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts, including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects. The level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors, including the amount of pass-through costs we incur during a period. On those projects where we are acting as principal for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs (and we refer to such costs as “pass-through costs”).\nBack charges to suppliers or subcontractors are recognized as a reduction of cost when it is determined that recovery of such cost is probable, and the amounts can be reliably estimated. Disputed back charges are recognized when the same requirements described above have been satisfied.\nVariable Consideration\nThe nature of the Company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and unpriced change orders; awards and incentive fees; and liquidated damages and penalties. The Company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value (i.e., the sum of a probability-weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount. Factors considered in determining whether revenue associated with claims (including change orders in dispute and unapproved change orders in regard to both scope and price) should be recognized include the following: (a) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim, (b) additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company’s performance, (c) claim-related costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed, and (d) evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable. If the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met, revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred and only up to the amount of consideration that is probable of not being reversed.\nThe Company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its engineering and construction contracts. The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the Company’s work on the project. Historically, warranty claims have not resulted in material costs incurred for which the Company was not compensated for by the customer.\nSee Note 3-\nRevenue Accounting for Contracts\nfor further discussion.\nJoint Ventures and VIEs\nAs is common to the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures. Although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients, the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners, or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures. Many of these joint ventures are formed for a specific project. The assets of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of cash and receivables (representing amounts due from clients), and the liabilities of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners (for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts) and other subcontractors. In general, at any given time, the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients. Very few of our joint ventures have employees or third-party debt or credit facilities. The debt held by the joint ventures is non-recourse to the general credit of Jacobs.\nThe assets of a joint venture are available for use for the obligations of the particular joint venture and not for general operations of the Company. Our risk of loss on these arrangements is usually shared with our partners. The liability of each partner is usually joint and several, which means that each partner may become liable for the entire risk of loss on the project. Furthermore, on some of our projects, the Company has granted guarantees which may encumber both our contracting subsidiary company and the Company for the entire risk of loss on the project. The Company is unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under outstanding performance guarantees related to joint venture projects due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the nature and extent of any contractual defaults by our joint venture partners, resource availability, potential performance delays caused by the defaults, the location of the projects, and the terms of the related contracts. See Note 19 -\nContractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations and Insurance\nfor further discussion.\nF-11\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nMost of the joint ventures are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIE”) because they lack sufficient equity to finance the activities of the joint venture. The Company uses a qualitative approach to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, which considers factors that indicate a party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture’s economic performance. These factors include the composition of the governing board, how board decisions are approved, the powers granted to the operational manager(s) and partner that holds that position(s), and to a certain extent, the partner’s economic interest in the joint venture. The Company analyzes each joint venture initially to determine if it should be consolidated or unconsolidated.\n•\nConsolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE or holds the majority of voting interests of a non-VIE (and no significant participative rights are available to the other partners).\n•\nUnconsolidated if the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE or does not hold the majority of voting interest of a non-VIE.\nOur unconsolidated joint ventures (including equity method investments) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable, and impairment losses are recognized for such investments if there is a decline in fair value below carrying value that is considered to be other-than-temporary.\nSee Note 8-\nJoint Ventures, VIEs and Other Investments\nfor further discussion.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented at “fair value.” Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the date fair value is determined (the “measurement date”). When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider only those assumptions we believe a typical market participant would consider when pricing an asset or liability. In measuring fair value, we use the following inputs in the order of priority indicated:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, such as (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; (ii) quoted prices in markets that have insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (e.g., less active markets); and (iii) model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated with, observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe net carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables and short-term debt approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. See Note 9-\nBorrowings\nfor a discussion of the fair value of long-term debt.\nCertain other assets and liabilities, such as forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements we purchased as cash-flow hedges discussed in Note 18-\nCommitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments\nand the Company's investment in Amentum ordinary shares discussed in\nNote 14- Discontinued Operations\nare required to be carried in our Consolidated Financial Statements at Fair Value.\nThe fair value of the Company’s reporting units (used for purposes of determining whether there is an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill) is determined using an income and market approach. Both approaches require us to make certain estimates and judgments. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units. Under the market approach, the fair values of our reporting units are determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units; the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization associated with the guideline companies. In assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired, we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated.\nWith respect to equity-based compensation (i.e., share-based payments), we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Like all option-pricing models, the Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including (i) the expected volatility of the market price\nF-12\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nof the underlying stock, and (ii) the expected term of the award, among others. Accordingly, changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause different fair values to be assigned to our future stock option awards. For restricted stock awards (including restricted stock units) containing service and performance conditions, fair value is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected level of achievement for any performance conditions.\nThe fair values of the assets owned by the various pension plans that the Company sponsors are determined based on the type of asset, consistent with U.S. GAAP. Equity securities are valued by using market observable data such as quoted prices. Publicly traded corporate equity securities are valued at the last reported sale price on the last business day of the year. Securities not traded on the last business day are valued at the last reported bid price. Fixed income investment funds categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers, or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Real estate consists primarily of common or collective trusts, with underlying investments in real estate. These investments are valued using the best information available, including quoted market price, market prices for similar assets when available, internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate, or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Management values insurance contracts and hedge funds using actuarial assumptions and certain values reported by fund managers.\nFair value measurements relating to our business combinations are made primarily using Level 3 inputs including discounted cash flow and to the extent applicable, Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Fair value for the identified intangible assets is generally estimated using inputs primarily for the income approach using the multiple period excess earnings method and the relief from royalties method. The significant assumptions used in estimating fair value include (i) revenue projections of the business, including profitability, (ii) attrition rates and (iii) the estimated discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. Other personal property assets, such as furniture, fixtures and equipment, are valued using the cost approach, which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the asset less depreciation. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation and the significant assumptions used include projections of revenues and probabilities of meeting those projections. Key inputs to the valuation of the noncontrolling interests include projected cash flows and the expected volatility associated with those cash flows.\nThe fair values for the asset groups relating to the impairment assessment of long-lived assets (see Note 10-\nLeases\n) were estimated primarily using discounted cash flow models (income approach) with Level 3 inputs. The significant assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods and discount rates that reflects the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows.\nThe methodologies described above and elsewhere in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements may produce a fair value measure that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes Level 3 valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement.\nCash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months to be cash equivalents.\nCash equivalents at September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 consisted primarily of money market mutual funds and overnight bank deposits.\nReceivables, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nReceivables include amounts billed, net and unbilled receivables. Amounts billed, net consist of amounts invoiced to clients in accordance with the terms of our client contracts and are shown net of an allowance for expected credit losses. We anticipate that substantially all of such billed amounts will be collected over the next twelve months.\nUnbilled receivables and other, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time in connection with our client contracts, are reclassified to amounts billed when they are billed under the terms of the contract. We anticipate that substantially all of such unbilled amounts will be billed and collected over the next twelve months.\nF-13\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nContract assets represent unbilled amounts where the right to payment is subject to more than merely the passage of time and includes performance-based incentives and services provided ahead of agreed contractual milestones. Contract assets are transferred to unbilled receivables when the right to consideration becomes unconditional and are transferred to amounts billed upon invoicing.\nContract liabilities represent amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized to date. We anticipate that substantially all such amounts will be earned over the next twelve months.\nProperty, Equipment, and Improvements\nProperty, equipment and improvements are carried at cost, and are shown net of accumulated depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Depreciation and amortization are computed primarily by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the related lease. Estimated u\nseful lives range from\n20\nto\n40\nyears for buildings, from\n3\nto\n10\nyears for equipment and from\n1\nto\n14\nyears for leasehold improvements.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; instead, on an annual basis we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for possible impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of those assets.\nFor purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure. We have determined that our operating segments are also our reporting units based on management’s conclusion that the components comprising each of our operating segments share similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria in accordance with ASC 350.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter each year. We begin with the qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the quantitative assessment described below.\nIf it is determined through the evaluation of events or circumstances that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company then compares the fair value of the related reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized\n. For the 2024 fiscal year, we performed a quantitative impairment test of the historical DVS reporting unit as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. For the remaining reporting units, we determined that the fair values significantly exceeded their carrying values and an analysis beyond the qualitative level was not considered necessary.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets other than goodwill principally consist of right-of-use (ROU) lease assets, property, equipment and improvements, and finite-lived intangible assets. These long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment for each of our asset groups in accordance with ASC 360 by first identifying whether indicators of impairment exist. If such indicators are present, we assess long-lived asset groups for recoverability based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows. For asset groups where the recoverability test fails, the fair value of each asset group is then estimated and compared to its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which an asset group’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nForeign Currencies\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, it is necessary to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, revenues and expenses of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates for the applicable periods being translated while the assets and liabilities of operations outside the U.S. are generally translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The net effect of foreign currency translation adjustments is included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nF-14\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nShare-Based Payments\nWe measure the value of services received from employees and directors in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value is recognized as a non-cash cost on a straight-line basis over the period the individual provides services, which is typically the vesting period of the award with the exception of awards containing an internal performance measure, such as Earnings Per Share growth and Return on Invested Capital, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period subject to the probability of meeting the performance requirements and adjusted for the number of shares expected to be earned. The cost of these awards is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nOur cash balances and cash equivalents are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, Africa and Asia. In the normal course of business, and consistent with industry practices, we grant credit to our clients without requiring collateral. Concentrations of credit risk is the risk that, if we extend a significant amount of credit to clients in a specific geographic area or industry, we may experience disproportionately high levels of default if those clients are adversely affected by factors particular to their geographic area or industry. Concentrations of credit risk relative to trade receivables are limited due to our diverse client base, which includes the U.S. federal government and multi-national corporations operating in a broad range of industries and geographic areas. Additionally, in order to mitigate credit risk, we continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our major commercial clients.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 842,\nLeases (\"ASC 842\")\n. ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. A lease exists when a contract conveys to the customer the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The definition of a lease embodies two conditions: (1) there is an identified asset in the contract, and (2) the customer has the right to control the use of the identified asset. Lessees are required to classify leases as either finance or operating leases. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nThe Company’s right-of use assets and lease liabilities relate to real estate, project assets used in connection with long-term construction contracts, IT assets and vehicles. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of less than\none year\nto\nnineteen years\n. T\nhe Company’s lease obligations are primarily for the use of office space and are primarily operating leases. Certain of the Company’s leases contain renewal, extension, or termination options. The Company assesses each option on an individual basis and will only include options reasonably certain of exercise in the lease term. The Company generally considers the base term to be the term provided in the contract. None of the Company’s lease agreements contain material options to purchase the leased property, material residual value guarantees, or material restrictions or covenants.\nLong-term project asset and vehicle leases (leases with terms greater than twelve months), along with all real estate and IT asset leases, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid. Because the Company primarily acts as a lessee and the rates implicit in its leases are not readily determinable, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate on the lease commencement date to calculate the present value of future lease payments. Certain leases include payments that are based solely on an index or rate. These variable lease payments are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability and are initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date. Other variable lease payments, such as payments based on use and for property taxes, insurance, or common area maintenance that are based on actual assessments are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability and are expensed as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments, the calculation of the ROU asset also includes any deferred rent, lease prepayments and initial direct costs of obtaining the lease, such as commissions.\nCertain lease contracts contain non-lease components such as maintenance and utilities. The Company has made an accounting policy election, as allowed under ASC 842-10-15-37 and discussed above, to capitalize both the lease component and non-lease components of its contracts as a single lease component for all of its right-of-use assets.\nF-15\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nShort-term project asset and vehicle leases (project asset and vehicle leases with an initial term of twelve months or less or leases that are cancellable by the lessee and lessor without significant penalties) are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The majority of the Company’s short-term leases relate to equipment used on construction projects. These leases are entered into at agreed upon hourly, daily, weekly or monthly rental rates for an unspecified duration and typically have a termination for convenience provision. Such equipment leases are considered short-term in nature unless it is reasonably certain that the equipment will be leased for a term greater than twelve months.\nPensions\nWe use certain assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the assets and liabilities of our pension plans. These assumptions involve discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. Changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material effect on the plans’ liabilities and the projected pension expense.\nWe use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net gains or losses in excess of ten percent of the larger of the pension benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. The period of amortization is the average remaining service of active participants who are expected to receive benefits under certain plans and the average remaining future lifetime of plan participants for certain plans.\nWe measure our defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the month closest to their fiscal year end, which is September 27, 2024 as the alternative measurement date in accordance with FASB guidance ASU 2015-04, Compensation Retirement Benefit (Topic 715):\nPractical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer’s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Asset\n. This guidance allows employers with fiscal year ends that do not coincide with a calendar month end to make an accounting policy election to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the month closest to their fiscal year end.\nF-16\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nIn connection with the PA Consulting investment in March 2021, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interests, representing the interest holders'\n35\n% equity interest in the form of preferred and common shares of PA Consulting. The preferred shares are entitled to a cumulative annual compounding\n12\n% dividend based on the outstanding preferred share subscription price. These noncontrolling interest holders have certain option rights to put the preferred and common share interests back to the Company at a value based on the fair value of PA Consulting (the redemption values). The primary inputs and assumptions impacting the fair value of PA Consulting include projections of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and discount rates applied thereto. Additionally, the Company has an option to call the interests for certain individual shareholders in certain circumstances. Because the interests are redeemable at the option of the holders and not solely within the control of the Company, the Company classified the interests in redeemable noncontrolling interests within its Consolidated Balance Sheet at their redemption values. The optional redemption features may become exercisable no earlier than\nfive years\nfrom the March 2, 2021 closing date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events.\nThe Company has deemed these interests probable of becoming redeemable in the future and requiring their measurement at the greater of (i) the redemption amount that would be paid if settlement occurred at the balance sheet date, or (ii) the historical value resulting from the original acquisition date fair value plus the impact of any earnings or loss attribution amounts, including dividends. The fair value of the PA Consulting redeemable noncontrolling interest is determined using a combination of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the projected discounted cash flows of PA Consulting. Under the market approach, the fair value is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to PA Consulting; the fair value is estimated based on the valuation multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nFurther, to the extent redemption values exceed historical values of the interests, changes in redemption amounts are recognized as changes to redeemable noncontrolling interests with an offsetting change in consolidated retained earnings. Additionally, particular to the preference share and in certain circumstances the ordinary share components of redeemable noncontrolling interests, such changes in consolidated retained earnings could also be reflected as a corresponding adjustment to net earnings attributable to Jacobs for purposes of the calculation of consolidated earnings per share attributable to common shareholders.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our consolidated income tax expense using the asset and liability method prescribed by U.S.\nGAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. If and when we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realized for its full amount, we will recognize and record a\nvaluation allowance with a corresponding charge to earnings. Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the normal course of business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome\n(including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the U.S., and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the U.S.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") contains a provision which subjects a U.S. parent of a foreign subsidiary to current U.S. tax on its global intangible low–taxed income (“GILTI”). The GILTI income is eligible for a deduction, which lowers the effective tax rate of GILTI to 10.5% for calendar years 2018 through 2025 and 13.125% after 2025. The Company will report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI.\nContractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations and Insurance\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. We record in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees, litigation and insurance claims. Guarantees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 460-10,\nGuarantees\n, at fair value at the inception of the guarantee. We perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for both insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective\nF-17\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nbalance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In addition, as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the U.S. federal government, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations and procurement practices. We adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations.\nBusiness Combinations\nU.S. GAAP requires that the purchase price paid for business combinations accounted for using the acquisition method be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective fair values. The Company makes certain estimates and judgments relating to other assets and liabilities acquired as well as any identifiable intangible assets acquired.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to employ estimates and make assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities; the revenues and expenses reported for the periods covered by the financial statements; and certain amounts disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although such estimates and assumptions are based on management’s most recent assessment of the underlying facts and circumstances utilizing the most current information available and past experience, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated periodically and adjusted accordingly.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes\n, (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, provides qualitative and quantitative updates to the Company's effective income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures, among others, in order to enhance the transparency of income tax disclosures, including consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disaggregation by jurisdiction of income taxes paid. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is also permitted. ASU 2023-09 will be effective for the Company's\nannual fiscal 2026 period\n.\nThe Company has identified and is implementing changes to processes and internal controls to meet the standard’s updated reporting and disclosure requirements.\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting, (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items to reconcile to segment profit or loss, and the title and position of the entity’s CODM. The amendments in this update also expand the interim segment disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments in this update are required to be applied on a retrospective basis. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for the Company's\nannual fiscal 2025 period.\nThe Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nASU 2023-06,\nDisclosure Improvements\n: Amendments - Codification Amendments in Response to the Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the standard to introduce changes to US GAAP that originate in either SEC Regulation S-X or S-K, which are rules about the form and content of financial reports filed with the SEC. The provisions of the standard are contingent upon instances where the SEC removes the related disclosure provisions from Regulation S-X and S-K. The Company does not expect that the application of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n3.\nRevenue Accounting for Contracts\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nF-18\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOur revenues are principally derived from contracts to provide a diverse range of technical, professional, and construction services to a large number of industrial, commercial, and governmental clients. We provide a broad range of engineering, design, and architectural services; construction and construction management services; operations and maintenance services; and technical, digital, process, scientific and systems consulting services. We provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located primarily in North America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, Africa, and Asia. We provide our services under cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Our contracts are with many different customers in numerous industries. Refer to Note 20 -\nSegment Information\nfor additional information on how we disaggregate our revenues by reportable segment.\nThe following table further disaggregates our revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nThe following table presents the revenues earned directly or indirectly from the U.S. federal government and its agencies, expressed as a percentage of total revenues:\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities represent amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized to date. Revenue recognized for the year ended September 27, 2024 that was previously included in the contract liability balance on September 29, 2023 was $\n521\nmillion. Revenue recognized for the year ended September 29, 2023 that was previously included in the contract liability balance on September 30, 2022 was $\n449\nmillion.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe Company’s remaining performance obligations as of September 27, 2024 represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. The Company had approximately $\n13.7\nbillion in remaining performance obligations as of September 27, 2024. The Company expects to recognize\n53\n% of our remaining performance obligations within the next\ntwelve months\nand the remaining\n47\n% thereafter. The majority of the remaining performance obligations after the first twelve months are expected to be recognized over a four-year period.\nAlthough our remaining performance obligations reflect business volumes that are considered to be firm, normal business activities including scope adjustments, deferrals or cancellations may occur that impact volume or expected timing of their recognition. Remaining performance obligations are adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and project deferrals, as appropriate.\nF-19\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n4.\nEarnings Per Share and Certain Related Information\nBasic and Diluted Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines EPS for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. Net earnings used for the purpose of determining basic and diluted EPS is determined by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities and the preferred redeemable noncontrolling interests redemption value adjustment associated with the PA Consulting transaction in fiscal 2024.\nF-20\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the Company launched an accelerated share repurchase program by advancing $250 million to a financial institution in a privately negotiated transaction, with final non-cash settlement on the program during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 of 342,054 shares.\nF-21\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe 2020 Repurchase Authorization expired on January 15, 2023. On January 25, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an incremental share repurchase program of up to $\n1.0\nbillion of the Company's common stock, to expire on January 25, 2026 (the \"2023 Repurchase Authorization\"). At September 27, 2024, the Company had $\n472.2\nmillion remaining under the 2023 Repurchase Authorization.\nThe following table summarizes repurchase activity under the 2020\nRepurchase Authorization during fiscal 2023\nthrough expiration during the second\nfiscal quarter of 2023:\n(1)\nIncludes commissions paid and excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and calculated at the average price per share.\nThe following table summarizes the activity under the 2023\nRepurchase Authorization\nduring fiscal 2024:\n(1)\nIncludes commissions paid and excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and calculated at the average price per share.\nOur share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to purchase any shares. Share repurchases may be executed through various means including, without limitation, accelerated share repurchases, open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or otherwise. The authorization for the share repurchase programs may be terminated, increased or decreased by the Company’s Board of Directors in its discretion at any time. The timing, amount and manner of share repurchases may depend upon market conditions and economic circumstances, availability of investment opportunities, the availability and costs of financing, currency fluctuations, the market price of the Company's common stock, other uses of capital and other factors.\nCommon and Preferred Stock\nJacobs is authorized to issue\ntwo\nclasses of capital stock designated “common stock” and “preferred stock” (each has a par value of $\n1.00\nper share). The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. The number of shares to be included in a series as well as each series’ designation, relative powers, dividend and other preferences, rights and qualifications, redemption provisions and restrictions are to be fixed by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time each series is issued. Except as may be provided by the Company’s Board of Directors in a preferred stock designation, or otherwise provided for by statute, the holders of shares of common stock have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters requiring stockholder action. The holders of shares of common stock are entitled to dividends if and when declared by the Company’s Board of Directors from whatever assets are legally available for that purpose.\nDividends\nOn September 26, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $\n0.29\nper share of the Company’s common stock, which was paid on November 22, 2024, to shareholders of record on the close of business on October 25, 2024.

This change in the valuation allowances is attributable primarily to a $\n10.3\nmillion valuation allowance increase due to the change in the realizability of foreign tax credits, a $\n51.2\nmillion increase due to a capital loss in Australia, offset by a $\n20.3\nmillion valuation allowance decrease as a result of expiring foreign tax credits and a $\n26.0\nmillion net operating loss utilization for other foreign assessable income, with an increase of $\n2.2\nmillion related to various other items.\nAt September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, the Company's domestic and international net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards totaled $\n915.6\nmillion and $\n918.7\nmillion, resulting in an NOL deferred tax asset of $\n259.3\nmillion and $\n265.4\nmillion, respectively. The Company's net operating losses have various expiration periods between 2025 and indefinite periods. At September 27, 2024, the Company has foreign tax credit carryforwards of $\n42.4\nmillion (which has a partial valuation allowance of $\n25.1\nmillion) with $\n9.5\nmillion expected to expire in 2025 and the remaining by 2033.\nF-27\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC.

The decision as to the amount of unremitted earnings that we intend to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries considers items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, and expected cash requirements in the U.S. As of September 27, 2024, we had not recognized a deferred tax liability on approximately $\n194.4\nmillion of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose additional taxes. The Company also has various long-term foreign currency denominated intercompany loans not anticipated to be settled in the foreseeable future, which are considered indefinitely reinvested as\nF-28\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nthey are viewed as part of the Company’s net investment in the subsidiary. The unrecognized deferred tax liability (the amount payable if distributed) for both the unremitted earnings and intercompany loans, which are indefinitely reinvested, is approximately $\n15.5\nmillion.\nIn December 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development “\"OEC”\") released the Pillar Two Model Rules (also referred to as the global minimum tax or Global Anti-Base Erosion “\"GloBE”\" rules), which were designed to ensure large multinational enterprises pay a minimum 15 percent level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction in which they operate. Several jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted these rules, which are effective for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending September 26, 2025. The Company is continually monitoring developments and evaluating the potential impacts. At this time, the Company does not anticipate a material impact to income tax expense as a result of implementation of these rules.\nThe Company accounts for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. It accounts for interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as interest and penalties reported above the line (i.e., not as part of income tax expense). The main driver of the current year increase relates to uncertain tax positions on R&D credits, which is offset by the release of uncertain tax positions whose statute of limitation expired during FY24. At September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, if recognized, $\n27.1\nmillion and $\n28.4\nmillion, respectively, would affect the Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate. The Company had $\n22.6\nmillion and $\n37.7\nmillion in accrued interest and penalties at September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The Company estimates that, within twelve months, we may realize a decrease in our uncertain tax positions of approximately $\n4.9\nmillion as a result of concluding various tax audits and closing tax years.\nThe amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by tax jurisdictions around the world. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities worldwide, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, India, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of September 27, 2024, the Company has certain US tax returns open to audit from 2009 through 2011 and 2019 through 2023. For the jurisdictions outside the US, primarily UK and Australia, various returns are open for audit for tax years 2014 through 2023. Although the Company believes the reserves established for the tax positions are reasonable, the outcome of tax audits could be materially different, both favorably and unfavorably.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, for continuing operations, for the years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nF-29\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC.

There are no consolidated VIEs that have debt or credit facilities.\nSummary financial information of consolidated VIEs is as follows (in millions):\nUnconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method or proportionate consolidation. Proportionate consolidation is used for joint ventures that include unincorporated legal entities and activities of the joint venture are construction-related. For those joint ventures accounted for under proportionate consolidation, only the Company’s pro rata share of assets, liabilities, revenue, and costs are included in the Company’s balance sheet and results of operations.\nFor the proportionate consolidated VIEs, the carrying value of assets and liabilities was $\n138.8\nmillion and $\n138.0\nmillion as of September 27, 2024, respectively, and $\n113.6\nmillion and $\n119.3\nmillion as of September 29, 2023, respectively. For those joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, the Company's investment balances for the joint venture is included in other noncurrent assets: miscellaneous on the balance sheet and the Company’s pro rata share of net income is included in revenue. In limited cases, there are basis differences between the equity in the joint venture and Jacobs' investment created when Jacobs purchased their share of the joint venture. These basis differences are amortized based on an internal allocation to underlying net assets, excluding allocations to goodwill. Our investments in equity method joint ventures on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 were a net asset of $\n36.6\nmillion and $\n32.1\nmillion, respectively. During the years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023, and September 30, 2022, we recognized income from equity method joint ventures of $\n11.9\nmillion, $\n3.1\nmillion, and $\n8.1\nmillion, respectively.\nAccounts receivable from unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for under the equity method is $\n12.3\nmillion and $\n11.4\nmillion as of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively.\nF-30\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC.

The credit extensions under the Revolving Credit Facility can be funded in U.S dollars, British Sterling, Euros, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Swedish Krona, Singapore dollars and other agreed upon alternative currencies. The Revolving Credit Agreement also provides for a financial letter of credit sub facility of $\n400.0\nmillion, permits performance letters of credit, and provides for a $\n100.0\nmillion sub facility for swing line loans. Letters of credit are subject to fees based on the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio and Debt Rating, whichever is more favorable to the Company.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement amended and restated the second amended restated credit agreement dated March 27, 2019, by and among JEGI and certain of its subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks and financial institutions, in order to, among other things, (a) extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to February 6, 2028, (b) replace and adjust interest rates based on market conditions and incorporate a sustainability-linked pricing adjustment, (c) revise the commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility to a range of\n0.10\n% to\n0.25\n% depending on the higher of the pricing level associated with JEGI's Debt Rating or the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, (d) increase the Consolidated Leverage Ratio financial covenant to\n3.50\n:1.00 (subject to temporary increases to\n4.00\n:1.00 following the closing of certain material acquisitions), (e) eliminate the net worth financial covenant and (f) add the Company as a guarantor of the obligations of JEGI and its subsidiaries under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nThe Company and JEGI maintain an unsecured delayed draft term loan facility (the “2021 Term Loan Facility”) established under an amended and restated term loan agreement dated February 6, 2023 (the \"Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement\"), by and among the Company and JEGI and a syndicate of banks and financial institutions.

These initiatives resulted in the abandonment of certain leased office spaces and the establishment of a formal plan to sublease certain other leased spaces that will no longer be utilized by the Company. In connection with the Company’s actions related to these initiatives, the Company evaluated certain of its lease right-of-use assets and related property, equipment and leasehold improvements for impairment under ASC 360.\nAs a result of the analysis, the Company recognized impairment losse\ns of $\n46.7\nmillion and $\n76.1\nmillion\nfor the fiscal years ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, which are included in\nselling, general and administrative expenses\nin the accompanying statements of earnings.

The 2023 SIP provides for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, share appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees. The 1999 ODSP provides for awards of shares of common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units and grants of non-qualified stock options to our outside (i.e., nonemployee) directors. Together the 2023 SIP and 1999 ODSP plans are known as the \"Stock Incentive Plans\".

An award of an option or SAR is granted on a\n1\n-to-1 basis (“Not Fungible”). Effective January 24, 2023, at which time the 2023 SIP was adopted, all awards are granted on a 1-to-1 basis.\nIn connection with the Separation Transaction, outstanding awards under the Stock Incentive Plans were converted into adjusted Jacobs awards for employees who continued employment with Jacobs after the closing and all employees who separated from employment prior to the closing or Amentum awards for CMS and C&I employees who transferred to Amentum and, in each case, the adjustment methodology was intended to preserve the value of the awards immediately prior to the Separation Transaction when measured immediately after the Separation Transaction. The outstanding Jacobs awards will continue to have the same terms and conditions. The adjustment to the awards did not result in material incremental compensation expense.\nAt September 27, 2024, the amount of compensation cost relating to non-vested awards not yet recognized in the financial statements is approximately $\n80.3\nmillion.

Such plans cover substantially all of our domestic, nonunion employees in the U.S. and are qualified under Section 401(k) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Similar plans outside the U.S. cover various groups of employees of our international subsidiaries and affiliates. Several of these plans allow the Company to match, on a voluntary basis, a portion of the employee contributions.\nThe following table presents the Company’s contributions to these savings plans for the years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nOur non-qualified deferred compensation programs provide benefits payable to directors, officers, and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future dates, upon retirement, or death. The plans are unfunded; therefore, benefits are paid from the general assets of the Company. Participants' cash deferrals earn a return based on the participants' selection of investments in several hypothetical investment options. Participants are also able to defer stock based compensation in the plans, which must remain invested in Company stock and are distributed in shares of Jacobs common stock. Since no investment diversification is permitted, changes in the fair value of Jacobs' common stock are not recognized. For the deferred compensation held in company stock, the number of shares needed to settle the liability is included in the denominator in both the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.\nThe following table presents the amount charged to (income)/expense for the Company’s deferred compensation plans for the years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nThe following table presents the amount relating to assets held as deferred compensation arrangement investments for the years ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 (in thousands):\nDeferred compensation arrangement investments are comprised primarily of the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and pooled-investment funds. The fair value of the pooled investment funds is derived using Level 2 inputs.\n13.\nPension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans\nCompany-Only Sponsored Plans\nWe sponsor various defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans covering employees of certain U.S. and international subsidiaries. The pension plans provide pension benefits that are based on the employee’s compensation and years of service. Our funding policy varies by country and plan according to applicable local funding requirements and plan-specific funding agreements.\nThe accounting for pension and other post retirement benefit plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic benefit cost and the value of the plans’ assets and benefit obligations. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. The discount rates used in valuing the plans' benefit obligations were determined with reference to high quality corporate and government bonds that are appropriately matched to the duration of each plan's obligations. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally based on using country-specific simulation models which select a single outcome for expected return based on the target asset allocation. The expected long-term rates of return used in the valuation are the annual average\nF-41\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC.

In general, investment allocations are determined by each plan’s trustees and/or investment committees. The objectives of the plans’ investment policies are to (i) maximize returns while preserving capital; (ii) provide returns sufficient to meet the current and long-term obligations of the plan as the obligations become due; and (iii) maintain a diversified portfolio of assets so as to reduce the risk associated with having a disproportionate amount of the plans’ total assets invested in any one type of asset, issuer or geography.

Restructuring initiatives were also implemented during fiscal 2023 relating to our investment in PA Consulting, which are expected to be substantially completed in early fiscal 2025, and the DVS segment reorganization, which is substantially completed. While restructuring activities for each of these programs are comprised mainly of employee termination costs, the separation activities and costs are primarily related to the engagement of outside services, dedicated internal personnel and other related costs dedicated to the Company's Separation Transaction.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company implemented certain restructuring and integration initiatives relating to the acquisitions of (i) BlackLynx, Inc. (“BlackLynx”) in November 2021, and (ii) StreetLight Data, Inc. (“StreetLight”) in February 2022. Also, during fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, the Company implemented further real estate rescaling\nF-54\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nefforts that were associated with its fiscal 2020 transformation program relating to real estate and other staffing initiatives. These initiatives are substantially completed.\nAs part of the Company's acquisition of CH2M Hill Companies, Ltd. (\"CH2M\") during fiscal 2018, the Company implemented certain restructuring plans that were comprised mainly of severance and lease abandonment programs as well as integration activities involving the engagement of professional services and internal personnel dedicated to the Company's integration management efforts. The activities of these initiatives have been substantially completed.\nCollectively, the above-mentioned restructuring activities are referred to as “Restructuring and other charges”.\nThe following table summarizes the impacts of the Restructuring and other charges by operating segment for the years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands):\n(1)\nThe years ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 included $\n163.4\nmillion and $\n61.1\nmillion of restructuring and other charges mainly relating to the Separation Transaction (primarily professional services and employee separation costs) and $\n6.4\nmillion and $\n14.3\nmillion in restructuring and other charges relating to the Company's investment in PA Consulting (primarily employee separation costs), respectively. Included in the years ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were $\n49.1\nmillion and $\n77.0\nmillion in charges associated mainly with real estate impairments, the majority of which related to Infrastructure & Advanced Facilities. For the year ended September 30, 2022, amounts included $\n91.3\nmillion pre-tax related to the final settlement of the Legacy CH2M Matter (as defined in Note 19-\nContractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations and Insurance\n), net of previously recorded reserves and approximately $\n27\nmillion in third party recoveries was recorded as receivables reducing SG&A.\n(2)\nThe year ended September 27, 2024 includes a $\n35.2\nmillion\nrealized gain on interest rate swaps settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.

As such, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts and interest rate hedging contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies and interest rates.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company entered into\ntwo\ntreasury lock agreements which had a total notional value of $\n500\nmillion to manage its interest rate exposure to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt before December 2023. On February 13, 2023, the Company settled these treasury lock agreements and issued the\n5.90\n% Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $\n500\nmillion, which resulted in the receipt of cash and a pre-tax gain of $\n37.4\nmillion, which is being amortized to interest expense and recognized over the term of the\n5.90\n% Bonds. See Note 9-\nBorrowings\nfor further discussion relating to the terms of the\n5.90\n% Bonds\n.\nThe unrealized net gain on these instruments was $\n23.6\nmillion and $\n26.5\nmillion, net of tax, and is included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2020 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate exposure on our variable rate loans. By entering into the swap agreements, the Company converted the LIBOR and SONIA rate based liabilities into fixed rate liabilities, for periods ranging from\nfive\nto\nten years\n.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with the Separation Transaction, the Company terminated\ntwo\ninterest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of $\n554.7\nmillion for a realized a gain of $\n35.2\nmillion. This realized gain previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income was recognized in miscellaneous income (expense) in the current period as the related interest payments are no longer expected to occur. As of September 27, 2024, the Company has\none\noutstanding instrument with a notional value of $\n200.0\nmillion.\nThe fair value of the interest rate swaps at September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 was $\n23.0\nmillion and $\n102.6\nmillion, respectively, included within miscellaneous other assets on the consolidated balance. The unrealized net gain on these interest rate swaps as of September 27, 2024  and September 29, 2023 was $\n17.4\nmillion and $\n77.2\nmillion, respectively, net of tax, and was included in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nAdditionally, in fiscal 2020, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement with a notional value of $\n127.8\nmillion to manage the interest rate and foreign currency exposure on our USD borrowings by a European subsidiary. By entering into the cross currency swap, the Company converted the LIBOR rate based borrowing in USD to a fixed rate Euro liability for three and a half years.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company paid down the borrowings hedged by the cross currency swap and settled the cross currency swap agreement.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the aggregate liability amounts denominated in U.S. dollars transitioned from underlying LIBOR benchmarked rates to the SOFR and the terms of the swaps were amended accordingly. The swaps were designated as cash-flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n.\nF-56\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAdditionally\n,\nthe Company held foreign exchange forward contracts in currencies that support our operations, including British Pound, Australian Dollar and other currencies, with notional values of\n$\n827.3\nmillion\nat September 27, 2024 and\n$\n857.7\nmillion\nat September 29, 2023. The length of these contracts currently ranges from\none\nto\ntwelve months\n. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts at September 27, 2024 was\n$\n15.3\nmillion\n, of which\n$\n15.8\nmillion\nis included within current assets and\n$(\n0.5\n) million\nis included within current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 27, 2024. The fair value of the contracts as of September 29, 2023 was\n$\n9.5\nmillion, of which $\n16.1\nmillion\nis included within current assets and\n$(\n6.6\n) million\nis included within current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 29, 2023. Associated income statement impacts are included in miscellaneous income (expense) in the consolidated statements of earnings for both periods.\nThe fair value measurements of these derivatives are being made using Level 2 inputs under ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement\n, as the measurements are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. We are exposed to risk from credit-related losses resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments. We perform credit evaluations of our counterparties under forward exchange and interest rate contracts and expect all counterparties to meet their obligations. We have not experienced credit losses from our counterparties.\nLetters of Credit\nAt September 27, 2024, the Company had issued and outstanding approximately $\n306.2\nmillion in LOCs and $\n2.3\nbillion in surety bonds. Of the outstanding LOC amount, $\n0.5\nmillion has been issued under the Revolving Credit Facility and $\n305.7\nmillion\nare issued under separate, committed and uncommitted letter-of-credit facilities.\n19.\nContractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations and Insurance\nIn the normal course of business, we make contractual commitments (some of which are supported by separate guarantees) and on occasion we are a party in a litigation or arbitration proceeding. The litigation or arbitration in which we are involved primarily includes personal injury claims, professional liability claims and breach of contract claims. Where we provide a separate guarantee, it is strictly in support of the underlying contractual commitment. Guarantees take various forms including surety bonds required by law, or standby letters of credit (\"LOC\" and also referred to as “bank guarantees”) or corporate guarantees given to induce a party to enter into a contract with a subsidiary. Standby LOCs are also used as security for advance payments or in various other transactions. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from an arbitrary date to completion of our work (e.g., engineering only) to completion of the overall project. See Note 18-\nCommitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments\nfor more information surrounding LOCs and surety bonds.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for most insurable aspects of our business and operations. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits depending upon the type of insurance and include certain conditions and exclusions which insurance companies may raise in response to any claim that is asserted by or against the Company. We have also elected to retain a portion of certain losses, claims and liabilities that occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs and utilize a number of internal financing mechanisms for these self-insurance arrangements, including the operation of certain captive insurance entities. As a result, we may be subject to a future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured. We intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of the contracts which the Company enters with its clients. Our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result, one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise.\nAdditionally, as a contractor providing services to the U.S. federal government, we are subject to many types of audits, investigations and claims by, or on behalf of, the government including with respect to contract performance, pricing, cost allocations, procurement practices, labor practices and socioeconomic obligations. Furthermore, our income, franchise and similar tax returns and filings are also subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states within the United States, as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the United States.\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include amounts representing our probable estimated liability relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, audits and investigations. We perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us, as well as for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our\nF-57\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nconsolidated results of operations. Insurance recoveries are recorded as assets if recovery is probable and estimated liabilities are not reduced by expected insurance recoveries.\nThe Company believes, after consultation with counsel, that such guarantees, litigation, U.S. government contract-related audits, investigations and claims and income tax audits and investigations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, beyond amounts currently accrued.\nIn 2012, CH2M HILL Australia PTY Limited, a subsidiary of CH2M, entered into a\n50\n/50 integrated joint venture with Australian construction contractor UGL Infrastructure Pty Limited. The joint venture entered into a Consortium Agreement with General Electric and GE Electrical International Inc. The Consortium was awarded a subcontract by JKC Australia LNG Pty Limited (\"JKC\") for the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of a\n360\nMW Combined Cycle Power Plant for INPEX Operations Australia Pty Limited at Blaydin Point, Darwin, NT, Australia (the \"Legacy CH2M Matter\"). The subcontract was terminated in January 2017. In or around August 2017, the Consortium commenced an arbitration. On April 12, 2022, JKC and the Consortium entered into a confidential deed of settlement (“Settlement Agreement”). Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, CH2M, as guarantor of CH2M Australia PTY Limited’s obligations with respect to the subcontract with JKC, made a cash payment to JKC in April 2022 of AUD\n640\nmillion (or approximately $\n475\nmillion using mid-April 2022 exchange rates). As a result of the settlement agreement, additional pre-tax charges of $\n91.3\nmillion were recorded during the year ended September 29, 2022 for this matter (over amounts previously reserved and reported in long-term Other Deferred Liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet). The Settlement Agreement provided for a release of claims between JKC and each member of the Consortium, and in connection with this agreement the members of the Consortium also waived all claims against each other and their respective parent guarantors relating to the project.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a receivable for certain expected third-party recoveries equal to approximately $\n27\nmillion before tax. The Company received the payment during fiscal 2023\n.\n20.\nSegment Information\nPrior to the Separation Transaction, the Company's\nfour\noperating segments were comprised of its\ntwo\nglobal lines of business (\"LOBs\"): Critical Mission Solutions (\"CMS\") and People, Places Solutions (\"P&PS\"), its business unit Divergent Solutions (\"DVS\") and its majority investment in PA Consulting. Subsequent to the Separation Transaction, the SpinCo businesses are now presented as discontinued operations for all periods and therefore not reflected in the segment disclosures below. For further information, refer to Note 14-\nDiscontinued Operations\n. In addition, the Company reorganized its operating and reporting structure whereby results for the formerly known P&PS operating segment and the portion of the DVS business and other supporting corporate expenses not conveying with the Disposal Group are now reported together, as Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities (\"I&AF\").\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the (“CODM”) and evaluates the performance of each of these segments and make appropriate resource allocations among each of the segments. For purposes of the Company’s goodwill impairment testing, it has been determined that the Company’s operating segments are also its reporting units based on management’s conclusion that the components comprising each of its operating segments share similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria for reporting units in accordance with ASC 350,\nIntangibles-Goodwill and Other\n.\nFinancial information for each segment is reviewed by the CODM to assess performance and make decisions regarding the allocation of resources. The CODM evaluates the operating performance of our operating segments using segment operating profit. The Company incurs certain SG&A that relate to its business as a whole which are not allocated to the segments.\nThe following tables present total revenues and segment operating profit from continuing operations for each reportable segment (in thousands) and includes a reconciliation of segment operating profit to total U.S. GAAP operating profit by including Restructuring and other charges (as defined in Note 17\n-Restructuring and Other Charges\n) and\nF-58\nJACOBS SOLUTIONS INC.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nF-63\nF-64\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1987.\nDallas, Texas\nNovember 25, 2024\nF-65\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Jacobs Solutions Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Jacobs Solutions Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Jacobs Solutions Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nDallas, Texas\nNovember 25, 2024"
