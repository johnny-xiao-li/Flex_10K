    "text": "General\nJohnson Controls International plc, headquartered in Cork, Ireland, is a global leader in smart, healthy and sustainable buildings, serving a wide range of customers in more than 150 countries. The Company’s products, services, systems and solutions advance the safety, comfort and intelligence of spaces to serve people, places and the planet. The Company is committed to helping its customers win and creating greater value for all of its stakeholders through its strategic focus on buildings.\n3\nJohnson Controls was originally incorporated in the state of Wisconsin in 1885 as Johnson Electric Service Company to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings and was renamed Johnson Controls, Inc. in 1974. In 2005, Johnson Controls acquired York International, a global supplier of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (\"HVAC\") and refrigeration equipment and services. Following this acquisition, Johnson Controls continued to expand its portfolio of building related product and service offerings for residential and commercial customers. In 2016, Johnson Controls, Inc. and Tyco International plc (\"Tyco\") completed their combination (the \"Merger\"), combining Johnson Controls' portfolio of building efficiency solutions with Tyco’s portfolio of fire and security solutions. Following the Merger, Tyco changed its name to “Johnson Controls International plc.”\nIn 2016, the Company completed the spin-off of its automotive business into Adient plc, an independent, publicly traded company. In 2019, the Company closed the sale of its Power Solutions business, completing the Company’s transformation into a pure-play building technologies and solutions provider.\nIn 2024, the Company announced that it was evaluating its non-core product lines in connection with its objective to be a pure-play provider of technologies and solutions for commercial buildings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Air Distribution Technologies business included within its Global Products segment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Residential and Light Commercial (\"R&LC\") HVAC business to Robert Bosch GmbH (“Bosch”). The R&LC HVAC business includes the Company's North America ducted business and Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning Holding (UK) Ltd., the Company’s global residential joint venture with Hitachi Global Life Solutions, Inc. (“Hitachi”), of which the Company owns 60% and Hitachi owns 40%. The sale of the R&LC HVAC business is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\nThe Company is a global leader in engineering, manufacturing, commissioning and retrofitting building products and systems, including residential and commercial HVAC equipment, industrial refrigeration systems, controls, security systems, fire-detection systems and fire-suppression solutions. The Company further serves customers by providing technical services, including maintenance, management, repair, retrofit and replacement of equipment (in the HVAC, industrial refrigeration, security and fire-protection space), and energy-management consulting. The Company's OpenBlue digital software platform enables enterprises to better manage their physical spaces by combining the Company's building products and services with cutting-edge technology and digital capabilities to enable data-driven “smart building” services and solutions. The Company partners with customers by leveraging its broad product portfolio and digital capabilities powered by OpenBlue, together with its direct channel service and solutions capabilities, to deliver outcome-based solutions across the lifecycle of a building that address customers’ needs to improve energy efficiency, enhance security, create healthy environments and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company conducts its business through four business segments:\n•\nBuilding Solutions North America\nwhich operates in the United States and Canada;\n•\nBuilding Solutions EMEA/LA\nwhich operates in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America;\n•\nBuilding Solutions Asia Pacific\nwhich operates in Asia Pacific; and\n•\nGlobal Products\nwhich operates worldwide.\nThe Building Solutions segments:\n•\nDesign, sell, install and service HVAC, controls, building management, refrigeration, integrated electronic security and integrated fire-detection and suppression systems; and\n•\nProvide energy-efficiency solutions and technical services, including data-driven \"smart building\" solutions as well as inspection, scheduled maintenance, and repair and replacement of mechanical and controls systems.\nThe Global Products segment designs, manufactures and sells:\n•\nHVAC equipment, controls software and software services;\n•\nRefrigeration equipment and controls;\n•\nFire protection and suppression; and\n•\nSecurity products, including intrusion security, anti-theft devices, access control, and video surveillance and management systems.\n4\nThe Company’s segments provide products and services primarily to commercial, institutional, industrial, data center, and governmental customers.\nFor more information on the Company’s segments, refer to Note 19, \"Segment Information,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nProducts, Systems, Services and Solutions\nThe Company sells and installs its commercial HVAC equipment and systems, control systems, security systems, fire-detection and fire suppression systems, equipment and services primarily through its extensive direct channel, consisting of a global network of sales and service offices. Significant sales are also generated through global third-party channels, such as distributors of air-conditioning, controls, security and fire-detection and suppression products. The Company’s large base of current customers leads to significant repeat business for the maintenance, retrofit and replacement markets. The Company is also able to leverage its installed base to generate sales for its service business. Trusted building brands, such as YORK®,  Metasys®, Ansul, Frick®, FM:Systems®, PENN®, Sabroe®, Silent-Aire®, Simplex® and Grinnell®, together with the breadth and depth of the products, systems and solutions offered by the Company, give it what it believes to be the most diverse portfolio in the building technology industry.\nThe Company has developed software platforms, including on-premises platforms and cloud-based software services, and integrated its products and services with digital capabilities to provide data-driven solutions to create smarter, safer and more sustainable buildings. The Company's OpenBlue platform enables enterprises to better manage their physical spaces delivering sustainability, new occupant experiences, safety and security by combining the Company’s building expertise with cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning-powered service solutions such as remote diagnostics, predictive maintenance, workplace management, compliance monitoring and advanced risk assessments. The Company leverages its product portfolio and service network, together with digital and data-driven technologies to offer integrated and customizable solutions focused on delivering outcomes to customers, including OpenBlue Buildings-as-a-Service, OpenBlue Net Zero Buildings-as-a-Service and OpenBlue Healthy Buildings. These services are generally designed to generate recurring revenue for the Company as it supports its customers in achieving their desired outcomes.\nIn fiscal 2024, products and systems accounted for 70% of sales from continuing operations and services accounted for 30% of sales from continuing operations.\nCompetition\nThe Company conducts its operations through a significant number of individual contracts that are either negotiated or awarded on a competitive basis. Key factors in the award of contracts include system and service performance, quality, price, design, reputation, technology, application engineering capability, availability of financing and construction or project management expertise. Competitors for HVAC equipment, security, fire-detection, fire suppression and controls in the residential and non-residential marketplace include many local, regional, national and international providers. Larger competitors include Honeywell International, Inc.; Siemens Smart Infrastructure, an operating group of Siemens AG; Schneider Electric SA; Carrier Global Corporation; Trane Technologies plc; Daikin Industries, Ltd.; Lennox International, Inc.; GC Midea Holding Co, Ltd. and Gree Electric Appliances, Inc. In addition, the Company competes in a highly fragmented building services market. The Company also faces competition from a diverse range of established companies, start-ups and other emerging entrants to the buildings industry in the areas of digital services, software as a service and the Internet of Things. The loss of any individual contract or customer would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nBusiness Strategy\nThe Company’s business strategy is to sustain and expand its position as a leader in commercial building technology and solutions by offering a full spectrum of products and solutions for commercial customers across the globe. In 2024, the Company acted to optimize its core commercial buildings portfolio with the sale of its Air Distribution Technologies business and the entry into a definitive agreement to sell its R&LC HVAC business. Following these portfolio optimization actions, the Company’s core strategy remains focused on creating growth platforms, driving operational improvements and creating a high-performance, customer-centric culture.\nThe Company has strong positions in attractive and growing end-markets across HVAC, controls, fire, security and services, enhanced by its comprehensive product portfolio and substantial installed base. The Company believes that it is well positioned to capitalize on the emerging and prevalent trends in the commercial buildings industry, including data centers, sustainable buildings, healthy buildings/indoor environmental quality and smart buildings. To capitalize on these trends, the Company\n5\nremains focused on maintaining leading positions in delivering commercial building products, systems and solutions through its direct and indirect channels, as well as enabling growth through digital, to develop and leverage the breath of its portfolio to drive attachment, offer differentiated services and solutions over the building lifecycle and generate recurring revenue. In furtherance of these goals, the Company has four strategic priorities:\nCapitalize on Key Growth Vectors:\nData centers, sustainable buildings, healthy buildings/indoor environmental quality and smart buildings represent key growth opportunities for the Company. The Company seeks to leverage its existing portfolio breadth and investments in product development, combined with the expansion of its digital products and capabilities powered by OpenBlue, to offer differentiated solutions and innovative deal structures to help customers achieve their objectives. The Company intends to expand its capabilities by investing in products and technologies, as well as expanding its partnerships, to power innovation that will allow it to provide differentiated services that are tailored to its customers’ desired outcomes.\nBringing Value Across the Building Lifecycle\n: The Company provides system and service solutions that maximize the opportunities around the lifecycle of the building, delivering outcomes to the customer that save energy, reduce emissions and optimize building lifecycle costs while improving the overall occupant experience. The Company’s ability to drive direct, integrated solutions within multiple domains enables opportunities for attachment, cross-selling, recurring revenue, and developing long term relationships with customers from installation to service, retrofit, and replacement.\nAccelerate in High Growth Digital Services, Regions and Verticals\n: The Company is focused on transforming its large service business through digital technology, further enabled by the Company’s installed base, domain expertise and global coverage. The Company is focused on developing and deploying connected equipment, systems and controls that will support the provision of digital services and solutions. The Company further intends to expand its presence in high growth regions and invest in high growth verticals within the markets it serves, including healthcare, commercial offices/campus, education and data centers.\nSustain a High-Performance, Customer-Centric Culture\n: The Company recognizes that developing talent and creating positive customer experiences is central to accomplishing its business strategies. The Company is investing in its talent to build a diverse workforce that is digital capable, solutions oriented and focused on continuous learning and growth. The Company aims to leverage its talent capabilities and training to create a customer-focused culture to drive customer loyalty and decisions.\nTo realize these priorities, the Company is leveraging its technology leadership, comprehensive product portfolio, global presence, substantial installed base and strong channels to monetize the lifecycle opportunities of systems, service, retrofit and replacement which are established and delivered by the Company’s direct field businesses and third-party channels across the globe. The Company is augmenting its strategic priorities with disciplined execution, productivity enhancements and sustainable cost management to create a path to realize expanded margins and enhanced profitability.\nBacklog and Orders\nBacklog and orders are additional metrics that are meant to provide management with a deeper level of insight into the progress of specific strategic and growth initiatives. Backlog is applicable to sales of products and systems and services and totaled $15.2 billion at September 30, 2024, including both the Building Solutions and Global Products segments. Orders provide management with a signal of customer demand for the Company's products and services, as well as an indication of future revenues and performance. However, the timing and conversion of backlog and orders are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks and are not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year.\nThe following table summarizes backlog and orders for the Building Solutions segments:\n(1)\nChange is compared to September 30, 2023 (backlog) and the year ended September 30, 2023 (orders) and excludes the impact of mergers, acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency.\n6\nRemaining performance obligations were $21.1 billion at September 30, 2024. Differences between the Company’s remaining performance obligations and backlog are primarily due to:\n•\nRemaining performance obligations include large, multi-purpose contracts to construct hospitals, schools and other governmental buildings, which are services to be performed over the building's lifetime with average initial contract terms of 25 to 35 years for the entire term of the contract versus backlog which includes only the lifecycle period of these contracts which approximates five years;\n•\nRemaining performance obligations exclude service contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts that are cancellable without substantial penalty versus backlog which includes short-term and cancellable contracts; and\n•\nRemaining performance obligations include the full remaining term of service contracts with substantial termination penalties versus backlog which includes only one year for all outstanding service contracts.\nThe Company reports backlog, which it believes is a useful measure of evaluating the Company's operational performance and relationship to total orders.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials used by the Company’s businesses in connection with their operations include steel, aluminum, brass, copper, polypropylene and certain fluorochemicals used in fire suppression agents. The Company also uses semiconductors and other electronic components in the manufacture of its products. During fiscal 2022 and portions of fiscal 2023, the Company experienced material cost increases due to global inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, increased demand and other regulatory and macroeconomic factors. The collective impact of these trends were favorable to revenue due to increased demand and price increases to offset inflation, while negatively impacting margins due to supply chain disruptions and cost pressures. However, throughout fiscal 2023 and 2024, the Company experienced improved margins as supply chain disruptions eased and higher priced backlog was converted to sales, as discussed in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Although the Company has seen its supply chain normalize, the Company could experience further disruptions, shortages and price inflation in the future, the effect of which will depend on the Company’s ability to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of these events. In fiscal 2025, commodity prices and availability could fluctuate throughout the year and could significantly affect the Company’s results of operations. For a more detailed description of the risks related to the availability of raw materials, components and commodities, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIntellectual Property\nGenerally, the Company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business. The Company protects its intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. The Company works actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to the Company's products, services, software, solutions, and branding. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by contracts, licenses, confidentiality or other agreements.\nThe Company owns numerous U.S. and non-U.S. patents (and their respective counterparts), the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products. Internal development allows the Company to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over its products and services. While the Company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, no single patent, or group of patents, is critical to the success of the business. The Company, from time to time, grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others.\nThe Company’s trademarks, certain of which are material to its business, are registered or otherwise legally protected in the U.S. and many non-U.S. countries where products and services of the Company are sold. The Company, from time to time, becomes involved in trademark licensing transactions.\nMost works of authorship produced for the Company, such as computer programs, catalogs and sales literature, carry appropriate notices indicating the Company’s claim to copyright protection under U.S. law and appropriate international treaties.\n7\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety Matters\nLaws addressing the protection of the environment and workers’ safety and health govern the Company’s ongoing global operations. They generally provide for civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive and remedial relief, for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where Company-related materials have been released into the environment.\nA portion of the Company’s products consume energy and use refrigerants. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change has resulted in more regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulations tend to be implemented under global, national and sub-national climate objectives or policies, and target the global warming potential (“GWP”) of refrigerants, equipment energy efficiency, and the combustion of fossil fuels as a heating source. The Company continues to invest in its product portfolio to meet or exceed emerging emissions regulations and standards.\nThe Company has expended substantial resources globally, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance. Certain of the Company’s businesses are, or have been, engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment. The Company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances.\nThe Company’s operations and facilities have been, and in the future may become, the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with environmental laws and worker safety laws or for the remediation of Company-related substances released into the environment. Such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance, abatement or remediation programs and, in some cases, payment of penalties. In addition, governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating perfluorooctane sulfonate (\"PFOS\"), perfluorooctanoic acid (\"PFOA\"), and/or other per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS\"), which were contained in certain of the Company's legacy firefighting foam products. These regulations include declining emission standards and limits set as to the presence of certain compounds. See Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters.\nGovernment Regulation and Supervision\nThe Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in areas such as consumer protection, government contracts, international trade, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax, licensing and others. For example, most U.S. states and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Company operates have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries. The Company's security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals. Wireline and wireless telephone companies in the U.S. are regulated by the federal and state governments. In addition, government regulation of fire safety codes can impact the Company's fire businesses. The Company’s businesses may also be affected by changes in governmental regulation of refrigerants, PFAS, energy efficiency standards, noise regulation and product safety regulations, including changes related to hydro fluorocarbons/emissions reduction efforts, energy conservation standards and the regulation of fluorinated gases. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which the Company conducts its business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect the Company's worldwide operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the Company's business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRegulatory Capital Expenditures\nThe Company’s efforts to comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable to its business and products often results in capital expenditures. The Company makes capital expenditures to design and upgrade its fire and security products to comply with or exceed standards applicable to the alarm, fire suppression and security industries. The Company also makes capital expenditures to meet or exceed energy efficiency standards and comply with applicable regulations, including the regulation of refrigerants, hydro fluorocarbons/emissions reduction efforts and the regulation of fluorinated gasses, particularly with respect to the Company’s HVAC products and solutions. The Company’s ongoing environmental compliance program also results in capital expenditures. Regulatory and environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions; however, expenditures in fiscal 2024 related solely to regulatory compliance were not material. It is management’s expectation that the amount of any future capital expenditures related to compliance with any individual regulation or grouping of related regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year. See Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters.\n8\nHuman Capital Management\nOverview and Governance\nThe development of a High-Performance Culture enables the Company to achieve its purpose to build smarter, healthier, and more sustainable tomorrows. The Company’s strategic drivers provide the direction that guides its workforce toward a culture of continuous improvement and innovation to exceed customers’ expectations and provide solutions for global challenges in the building systems industry.\nThe responsibility to develop and maintain a High-Performance Culture is owned, embedded and executed throughout the Company. The Chief Human Resources Officer (\"CHRO\") is responsible for establishing the Company’s strategy to drive a High-Performance Culture and ensuring its execution across the Company. The Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the Board of Directors is the primary overseer of the Company’s High-Performance Culture strategy and execution, ensuring that the Company presents an employee value proposition that supports retention and the attraction of external talent. The Governance and Sustainability Committee is the primary overseer of employee health and safety. The Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), the CHRO, the General Counsel, the Vice President of Global Environment Health & Safety, the Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and other senior leaders within the Company are responsible for the execution of the strategy and engage with the Compensation and Talent Development Committee, the Governance and Sustainability Committee and the full Board of Directors on the critical components driving the Company’s High-Performance Culture, including discussions of future of work, human capital trends, processes and practices, diversity, equity and inclusion, health and safety, talent development, company culture and succession planning. Key components driving the Company’s High-Performance Culture include:\nHealth and Safety\nHealth and Wellness, Safety and Environment are the three pillars of the Company’s Zero Harm vision. The Company’s health and safety programs are designed around global standards with appropriate variations addressing multiple jurisdictions and regulations, specific hazards and unique working environments of the Company’s manufacturing, service, systems, and headquarter operations.\nThe Company requires each of its locations to perform regular safety audits to ensure proper safety policies, program procedures, analyses and training are in place. In addition, the Company engages an independent third-party conformity assessment and certification vendor to audit selected operations for adherence to its global health and safety standards. Cultural and values-based safety initiatives have been deployed within the Company to sustain and further enhance performance.\nThe Company utilizes a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its operations. Lagging indicators include the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate (\"TRIR\") and the Lost Time (or Lost Workday) Incident Rate (\"LTIR\") based upon the number of incidents per 100 employees (or per 200,000 work hours). In fiscal 2024, the Company had a TRIR of 0.34 and a LTIR of 0.13.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nThe Company is dedicated to creating a workplace where diversity is celebrated, where every employee feels included and valued, and where equitable practices are the norm. The Company aims to foster a culture of innovation, collaboration, and respect that drives its success in the global marketplace. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) is a component of the Company’s strategy to drive a High-Performance Culture, recognized as adding value to the Company’s creation and delivery of innovative high performing products and enabling solutions to its customers’ toughest problems. The Company has elevated its focus on ‘equity’ to enable all employees to have access to the opportunities, resources, support and networks they need to develop and succeed. The Company empowers employees to take an active role in creating a culture that values uniqueness, celebrates creativity and drives innovation. The Company encourages employees to enable an inclusive culture through active participation in Business Resource Groups (\"BRGs\") - employee-led voluntary organizations of people with similar interests, experiences, or demographic characteristics. The Company continues to increase participation in its BRG chapters worldwide across eleven categories: African American, Asia Pacific, LGBTQ+, Emerging Leaders, Hispanic, Disabilities, Veterans, Women, Sustainability, Parents and Caregivers, and Mindful Living. Each BRG is open to all employees and sponsored and supported by senior leaders across the enterprise. The Company’s BRG structure includes monthly learning series, an active recruitment platform, an innovation hub, community engagement and feedback sessions. The Company also engages BRGs to support the acquisition and development of diverse talent internally and externally.\n9\nThe Company is committed to enabling employees to bring their authentic selves to work each day, which in turn adds value, fosters creativity, and inspires change across the organization. The Company recognizes that it is its people that make the Company exceptional. The Company has developed robust policies and strategies to support this vision in its operations and its communities, including strategies addressing social impact and employee experience. The Company is committed to the implementation of its DEI mission, vision and roadmap including a focus on employee experience, business resource groups, learning and development and external impact.\nThe Company recognizes that fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment requires ongoing commitment, accountability, and continuous improvement. The Company regularly assesses its progress, recognizes employee contributions, and holds leaders accountable for driving DEI initiatives. The Company also creates mechanisms for open dialogue and feedback from employees to ensure that everyone’s voices are heard.\nThe Company has implemented several measures that focus on ensuring accountabilities exist for fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment:\n•\nDiversity Objectives:\nThe CEO and other senior leaders have diversity and inclusion objectives in their annual performance goals.\n•\nAttracting Diverse Talent:\nBRGs are instrumental in positively impacting the attraction of diverse talent to the Company. BRGs support these efforts through external engagement and support of talent acquisition sourcing initiatives. The Company’s global flagship Future Leaders Internship Program continues to expand the diversity of its outreach and focus on the skills needed to advance the Company’s growth initiatives. In 2024, the Company, in response to employee feedback, launched the Mindful Living and Parents and Caregivers Together (\"PACT\")  BRG groups. Interest and enthusiasm has been strong, and the new BRGs are growing membership at the fastest pace of any BRG group.\n•\nHonoring Employee Contributions:\nThe Company’s Diversity Distinction Awards serve as a recognition and encouragement for workforce contributions to the Company’s DEI efforts. Awarded to eight employees three times per year, the nomination driven Diversity Distinction Awards have become a highly regarded recognition of employee’s contribution  to the progress of the Company’s DEI journey.\nTalent Development\nThe Company must ensure the continued development and advancement of its employees to maintain a High-Performance Culture. The Company has adopted a continuous improvement approach to talent development, working to support employees’ growth while defining the skills and capabilities the organization will need in future years. To assess current enterprise capabilities and define future needs, strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur on a planned cadence annually – globally and across all business areas. The Company continues to provide opportunities for its employees to grow their careers, with more than half of open management positions filled internally during fiscal 2024.\nThe Company believes that high performance is an outcome of an employee’s ability to change, adapt, and grow their capabilities throughout their career. This talent development approach includes self and multi-rater assessments, functional and leadership competency models, providing employees a personalized approach to their development planning and skill acquisition. The Company emphasizes real-life, real-time learning that enables each employee to meet the demands of challenging and changing work and focuses on reinforcing key principles that are designed to support an individual’s effectiveness in his or her current job and in their future development. The Company provides technical and leadership training to employees, customers and suppliers who work for or with the Company’s products and services.\nThe Company’s focus on employee development has been structured over the last several years through programs designed to imbed essential skills with employees and reinforce strategic goals aligning with the Company’s culture, including:\n•\nDigital Transformation:\nIn support of Company’s growth strategy, the Company is investing in developing digital leadership with personalized and targeted training programs designed to create digitally capable leaders, salespersons, engineers and technicians.\n•\nDiversity and Inclusion:\nThe Company has developed a structured diversity and inclusion education curriculum across the levels and stages of individuals' careers to develop and align employees with the Company’s diversity and inclusion strategy and values. The Dimensions training program is designed to develop careers of under-represented talent and a toolkit for managers to guide their self-led inclusion efforts.\nIn fiscal 2024, the program was expanded\n10\nbeyond North America to a global audience. The Company’s flagship Women in Leadership (\"WIL\") program continues to grow in participation with a total increase of 162% since inception in 2022.\nThe program is demonstrating measurable impact with 28% of original cohort participants being promoted since program completion.\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company offered a robust curriculum of almost 225,000 activities that were completed by employees, consisting of videos, courses, e-learning, documentation, articles and books, including over 4,000 active (in person or virtual) learning courses. In fiscal 2024, over 1.17 million learning activities were completed by over 81,000 employees (excluding non-wired). The total learning hours consumed by employees was 1.58 million hours, averaging almost 20 hours per employee including time invested in formal learning and standard time invested in self-paced reading or video consumption.\nOrganizational Engagement\nThe Company measures the engagement of its employees using a quarterly pulse survey initially launched in fiscal 2023. The engagement survey provides managers with their own data dashboard to view their own engagement results and can be utilized by managers at all levels to understand how to improve the Company’s culture and employee engagement. Managers are provided with resources to interpret their results and plan their actions following each survey.\nEmployee Population and Demographics\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company employed approximately 94,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 35,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 59,000 were outside the United States. Approximately 22,000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and the Company believes that its relations with its labor unions are generally positive.\n(1)\nMale and female data represents all employees globally. Minority data represents U.S. employees only.\nSeasonal Factors\nCertain of the Company's sales are seasonal as the demand for residential air conditioning equipment and services generally increases in the summer months. This seasonality is mitigated by the other products and services provided by the Company that have no material seasonal effect.\nResearch and Development Expenditures\nRefer to Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for research and development expenditures. The Company has committed to invest a substantial portion of its new product research and development in climate and efficiency-related innovation to develop sustainable products and services. The Company invests in enhancements to the capabilities of its product lines and services to support its strategy, meet consumer preferences and achieve regulatory compliance. This includes investments in the development of the Company’s OpenBlue platform and related service offerings, digital product capabilities, energy efficient products, and low GWP refrigerants and technology.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, definitive proxy statements on Schedule 14A, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of the Company’s Internet website at http://www.johnsoncontrols.com as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.

    "text": "Provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.” The disclosure of a risk should not be interpreted to imply that such risk has not already materialized. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes are immaterial may also impair the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur future growth is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new products, services and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.\nOur future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire, manufacture and bring competitive, and increasingly complex, products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively. Our ability to develop or acquire new products, services and technologies requires the investment of significant resources. These acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies, products or services on a timely basis. Further, we must continue to effectively adapt our products and services to a changing technological and regulatory environment to drive growth and defend against disruption caused by competitors, regulators or other external forces impacting our business and operations. If we are unable to be agile and responsive to disruption in the development of new products, services and technologies, including technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nEven after introduction, new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products. Further, as we integrate emerging and rapidly evolving technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning into our products and services, we may not be able to anticipate or identify vulnerabilities, design flaws or security threats resulting from the use of such technology and develop adequate protection measures. As a result, these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer. We must also attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products, particularly with respect to our digital services and solutions business and OpenBlue software platform. The laws and regulations applicable to our products, and our customers’ product and service needs, change from time to time, and regulatory changes may render our products and technologies noncompliant or result in new or enhanced regulatory scrutiny. In addition, the markets for our products, services and technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. The failure of our technology, products or services to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors, the introduction of new competitors to the market with new or innovative product offerings or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues, increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to increase organizational effectiveness through the execution of our operating model and organizational improvements may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our business.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are dependent upon our ability to execute on our operating model and drive organizational improvement. We seek to develop and maintain a high-performance, customer centric culture and commercial organization characterized by continuous efficient and timely customer service, customer support, and customer intimacy enabling long-term customer loyalty. Our ability to successfully implement our operating model includes our ability to organize our operations around our commercial strategy through organizational improvements and implementing incentive programs that promote and reward the effective execution of our strategy. If we are unable to successfully implement and execute our operating model, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe seek to drive organizational improvement through a variety of actions, including restructuring and integration activities, digital transformation, strategic initiatives, business portfolio reviews, productivity initiatives, functionalization, incentive programs, training, executive management changes, and business and operating model assessments. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company committed to a multi-year restructuring plan to address stranded costs and further right-size its global operations as a result of previously announced portfolio optimization transactions. The Company’s ability to execute the most significant aspects of the restructuring plan will be dependent on the timing of the close of the R&LC HVAC business divestiture transaction. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, including a delay in the completion of the R&LC HVAC business divestiture, additional unexpected costs, loss of customer relationships, realization of fewer than\n12\nestimated productivity improvements, increased change fatigue, organizational strain and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed, and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, our failure to effectively implement our operating model and manage organizational changes may lead to increased attrition of customers and employees and harm our ability to attract and retain key talent.\nOur business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a high-performance, customer-centric and diverse management team and workforce. Continuous efficient and timely customer service, customer support and customer intimacy are essential to enabling customer loyalty and driving our financial results. Our growth strategies require that we pivot to new talent capability investments and build the workforce of the future, with an emphasis on developing skills in digital and consultative, outcome-based selling. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership and talent capacity with the necessary skillset and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives, execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership. Any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nThe nature of our business requires us to maintain a labor force that is sufficiently large enough to support our manufacturing operations to meet customer demand, as well as provide on-site services and project support for our customers. This includes recruiting, hiring and retaining skilled trade workers to support our direct channel field businesses. We have in the past, and could in the future, experience shortages for skilled or unskilled labor. The impacts of such labor shortages could limit our ability to scale our operations to meet increased demand and convert backlog into revenue, which could negatively impact our growth and results of operations.\nIn July 2024, we announced that George Oliver, our Chief Executive Officer, had informed the Board of his plan to retire and requested that the Board initiate the Company’s Chief Executive Officer succession plan. If we are unable to identify and retain a qualified successor for Mr. Oliver and successfully implement our Chief Executive Officer succession plan, then we could experience disruption in the setting and execution of our operational and strategic objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We also may have difficulty attracting and recruiting, or retaining, qualified senior leadership during the pendency of our search for a new Chief Executive Officer.\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact our results.\nProduct and service quality issues could harm customer confidence in our company and our brands. If certain of our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding quality, safety or performance, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and we could be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. In addition, when our products fail to perform as expected, we are exposed to warranty, product liability, personal injury and other claims. We have experienced such quality issues in the past and may experience such issues in the future.\nWe cannot be certain that our quality controls and procedures will reveal defects in our products or their raw materials, which may not become apparent until after the products have been placed in use in the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that products will have defects, which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance and require a product recall or field corrective action. Such remedial actions can be expensive to implement and may damage our reputation, customer relationships and market share. We have conducted product recalls and field corrective actions in the past and may do so again in the future.\nIn many jurisdictions, product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery. If any such claims or contribution requests or requirements exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, a recall or claim could require us to review some or all of our product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other products, which could result in a significant disruption to our business and which could have a further adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claims in the future, that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims or that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recall, repair and replacement costs.\n13\nCybersecurity incidents impacting our IT systems and digital products could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and materially and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT and data security infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new systems or integrate existing systems, they may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems, which\nare vulnerable to increased risks, including the risk of security breaches, system failures and disruptions,\nand implementing necessary upgrades. In addition,\ncertain of our employees work remotely at times, which increases our vulnerability to cybersecurity and other IT risks.\nIf we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system as a result of increased burdens placed on our IT infrastructure or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers, including cloud providers. These threats and incidents originate from many sources globally, including threats from sophisticated nation-state actors and organized criminal groups, and include malware in the form of computer viruses, ransomware, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, adware, scareware, rogue software, and programs that act against the computer user. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, IT systems or networks are constantly evolving and may not be recognized until launched against a target. We and third parties utilize vendors to support our business and operations have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, which add to the risks to our IT systems (including our cloud services providers’ systems), internal networks, our customers’ systems and the information that they store and process. In September 2023, we experienced a cybersecurity incident consisting of unauthorized access, data exfiltration and deployment of ransomware by a third party to a portion of our internal IT infrastructure. We have and may continue to incur significant costs in connection with the cybersecurity incident, including infrastructure investments or remediation efforts. The incident could also cause reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions and fines levied by governmental organizations, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. There can be no assurance that additional unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur or that we will not suffer material losses in the future. We could also experience similar consequences from future cybersecurity incidents. Other potential consequences could include the theft of intellectual property and the diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nOur customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. We deploy countermeasures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate cybersecurity threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, monitoring of our IT networks and systems, maintenance of backup and protective systems and the incorporation of cybersecurity design throughout the lifecycle of our products. Despite these efforts, we have experienced, and will likely continue to experience, attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers’, databases or systems. Cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, have resulted, and may in the future result, in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Such incidents have remained, and could in the future remain, undetected for an extended period of time, and the losses arising from such incidents could exceed our available insurance coverage for such matters. In addition, security breaches impacting our IT systems have in certain cases resulted in, and in the future could result in, a risk of loss or unauthorized disclosure or theft of information, which could lead to enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory or governmental audits, investigations and possible liability.\nAn increasing number of our products, services and technologies, including our OpenBlue software platform, are delivered with digital capabilities and accompanying interconnected device networks, which include sensors, data, building management systems and advanced computing and analytics capabilities. If we are unable to manage the lifecycle cybersecurity risk in development, deployment and operation of our digital platforms and services, they could become susceptible to cybersecurity incidents and lead to third-party claims that our product failures have caused damages to our customers. This risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products and the role they play in managing building systems.\n14\nData privacy, identity protection and information security compliance may require significant resources and presents certain risks.\nWe collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, customer data, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, our business and our products may be vulnerable to security incidents, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or errors that could potentially lead to compromising such data, improper use of our products, systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. During September 2023, we experienced a cybersecurity event consisting of unauthorized access, data exfiltration and deployment of ransomware by a third party to a portion of our internal IT infrastructure. The actual or perceived risk of theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, employee or other data as a result of the cybersecurity incident, as well as non-compliance with applicable industry standards or our contractual or other legal obligations or privacy and information security policies regarding such data, could result in costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions. We could face similar consequences in the future if we, our suppliers, channel partners, customers or other third parties experience the actual or perceived risk of theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of data, including as a result of employee error or malfeasance, or as a result of the imaging, software, security and other products we incorporate into our products. Such an event could lead customers to select the products and services of our competitors. Both the cybersecurity incident and similar future incidents could harm our reputation, cause unfavorable publicity or otherwise adversely affect certain potential customers’ perception of the security and reliability of our services as well as our credibility and reputation, which could result in lost sales.\nWe operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, proposed regulations restricting the use of biometric security technology could impact the products and solutions offered by our security business. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.\nSome of our contracts do not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. While we maintain general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions, such coverage might not be adequate or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of customer data, that such coverage will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are incorporating artificial intelligence technologies into our products, services and processes. These technologies may present business, compliance and reputational risks.\nRecent technological advances in artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine-learning technology both present opportunities and pose risks to us. If we fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving technological developments in AI, our competitive position and business results may suffer. The introduction of these technologies, particularly generative AI, into internal processes and/or new and existing offerings may result in new or expanded risks and liabilities, including due to enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, compliance issues, ethical concerns, confidentiality or security risks, as well as other factors that could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial results. In addition, our personnel could, unbeknownst to us, improperly utilize AI and machine learning-technology while carrying out their responsibilities. The use of AI in the development of our products and services could also cause loss of intellectual property, as well as subject us to risks related to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, data privacy and cybersecurity. The use of artificial intelligence can lead to unintended consequences, including generating content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate, misleading or otherwise flawed, or that results in unintended biases and discriminatory outcomes, which could harm our reputation and business and expose us to risks related to inaccuracies or errors in the output of such technologies. We also face risks of competitive disadvantage if our competitors more effectively use AI to drive internal efficiencies or create new or enhanced products or services that we are unable to compete against.\n15\nInfringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of third parties, could negatively affect us.\nWe rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, know-how, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology, trade secrets or know-how. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate. While we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how, business strategy and other proprietary information, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. From time to time, we resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings can be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. For those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired, the product is generally open to competition. Products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we are, from time to time, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. The litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties, and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position. Intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on our global direct installation channel for a significant portion of our revenue. Failure to maintain and grow the installed base resulting from direct channel sales could adversely affect our business.\nUnlike many of our competitors, we rely on a direct sales channel for a substantial portion of our revenue. The direct channel provides for the installation of fire and security solutions, and HVAC equipment manufactured by us. This represents a significant distribution channel for our products, creates a large installed base of our fire and security solutions and HVAC equipment, and creates opportunities for longer term service, monitoring, solutions and retrofit revenue over the lifecycle of the building. If we are unable to maintain or grow this installation business, whether due to changes in economic conditions, a failure to anticipate changing customer needs, a failure to introduce innovative or technologically advanced solutions, or for any other reason, our installation revenue could decline, which could in turn adversely impact our product pull-through and our ability to grow service, monitoring, solutions and retrofit revenue.\nGlobal climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business.\nThe effects of climate change create financial and operational risks to our business. For example, the effects of climate change could impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing, exacerbate existing risks to our supply chain and increase insurance and other operating costs. These factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and disruptions that could result in increased prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change has resulted in more regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulations tend to target the global warming potential (“GWP”) of refrigerants, equipment energy efficiency, and the combustion of fossil fuels. Many of our products consume energy and use refrigerants. Regulations which seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions present a risk to our global products business, predominantly our HVAC business, if we do not adequately prepare and refresh our product portfolio. As a result, we have and may in the future be required to make increased research and development and other capital expenditures to meet new regulations and standards. Further, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards through regulation, market-based emissions policies or consumer preference that we may not be able to timely meet due to the required level of capital investment or technological advancement. While we have been committed to continuous improvements to our product portfolio to meet and exceed anticipated regulations and preferences, there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will reflect our product development investments.\n16\nThere continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Such regulatory uncertainty extends to incentives, which if discontinued, could adversely impact the demand for energy efficient buildings, and could increase costs of compliance. These factors may impact the demand for our products, obsolescence of our products and our results of operations.\nFailure to achieve our public sustainability commitments could negatively affect our reputation and business.\nAs of the date of this filing, we have made several public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, including commitments to achieve net zero carbon emissions for Scope 1 and 2 by 2040 and the establishment of science-based targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions from our operations and Scope 3, category 11 emissions from the use of sold products in the operations of our customers. Although we intend to meet these commitments, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational and capital costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. We may determine that it is in the best interest of our company and our shareholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current commitments based on economic, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we are unable to meet these commitments, we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups and other stakeholders, which could adversely impact the perception of our brand and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, which could in turn adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ability of suppliers to deliver raw materials, parts and components to our manufacturing facilities, and our ability to manufacture and deliver services without disruption, could affect our results of operations.\nWe use a wide range of materials (primarily steel, copper and aluminum) and components (including semiconductors and other electronic components) in the global production of our products, which come from numerous suppliers around the world. Because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers, we are subject to supply and pricing risk. Our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns, transportation delays, work stoppages, labor relations, labor shortages, global geopolitical instability, price inflation, governmental regulatory and enforcement actions, intellectual property claims against suppliers, financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy, information technology failures, and hazards such as fire, earthquakes, flooding, or other natural disasters. For example, during 2022 and 2023 we experienced the following supply chain issues, due to economic, political and other factors largely beyond our control: increased input material costs and component shortages; supply chain disruptions and delays and cost inflation. In addition, some of our subcontractors have experienced supply chain and labor disruptions, which have and could in the future impact\nour ability to timely complete projects and convert our backlog. Such disruptions have and could in the future interrupt our ability to\nmanufacture or obtain certain products and components, thereby adversely impacting our ability to provide products to customers and realize expected profit margins. We could experience the reoccurrence of similar or new disruptions in the future, the effect of which will depend on our ability to successfully mitigate the impact of these disruptions. Any such disruption could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMaterial supply shortages and delays in deliveries, along with other factors such as price inflation, can also result in increased pricing. While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. The inability to timely convert our backlog due to supply chain disruptions subjects us to pricing risk due to cost inflation occurring between the generation of backlog and its conversion into revenue. If we are unable to effectively manage the impacts of price inflation and timely convert our backlog, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could materially and adversely be affected.\nA material disruption of our operations due to catastrophic or geopolitical events, particularly at our monitoring and/or manufacturing facilities, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIf our operations, particularly at our monitoring facilities and/or manufacturing facilities, were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, pandemics, climate change, cybersecurity incidents, power outages, fires, explosions, abrupt political change, armed conflict, terrorism, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes, labor shortages or other reasons, we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals, fill customer orders, convert our backlog, collect revenue and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers, which could adversely affect our financial performance. These events may also cause us to experience increased costs and reduced productivity. For\n17\nexample, our recent cybersecurity incident caused disruptions to our operations, adversely affecting our financial performance in early fiscal 2024. Further, the occurrence or reoccurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInterruptions to production could increase our costs and reduce our sales. Any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders, which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition. We maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, cybersecurity insurance to mitigate losses resulting from cybersecurity incidents, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business may be adversely affected by work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force.\nWe employ approximately 94,000 people worldwide. Approximately 23% of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently, no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees or our employees generally, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor. Additionally, a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Work stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products.\nRisks Relating to Strategic Transactions\nWe may not realize the benefits of our ongoing efforts to simplify our portfolio.\nWe continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines. Recently, we have been engaged in a strategic evaluation of our non-core product lines, leading to the divestiture of our Air Distribution Technologies business and the entry into a definitive agreement to divest our R&LC HVAC business. Divestitures such as these involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business. We may also experience unfavorable reaction to the divestiture by customers, competitors, suppliers and employees, making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships. Some divestitures, including the divestiture of our R&LC HVAC business, are or may be dilutive to earnings and we may not be successful in executing restructurings and other actions to minimize or offset dilution. We may also fail to successfully complete divestitures, achieve the strategic objectives of divestitures or not realize such objectives within the expected time frame, including our objective to simplify our portfolio to be a pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions for commercial buildings. With respect to the R&LC HVAC business divestiture, there can be no assurance whether and when the closing conditions will be satisfied or waived, and whether the strategic benefits and expected financial impact of the divestiture will be achieved. In addition, divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In the event we are unable to successfully divest a business or product line, we may be forced to wind down such business or product line, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot provide assurance as to whether we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line, and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may also result in a diversion of management attention, operational difficulties and losses.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or joint ventures.\nWe expect acquisitions of businesses and assets, as well as joint ventures (or other strategic arrangements), to play a role in our future growth and our ability to build capabilities in our products and services. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or joint venture targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or form joint ventures, or manage the timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our\n18\nbusinesses. Competition for acquisition opportunities may rise, thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions.\nAcquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrences, equity issuances, operating losses and expenses and may be dilutive to earnings. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including: the diversion of management attention to integration matters; difficulties in integrating operations and systems; challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures; difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel; challenges in successfully integrating and operating businesses with different characteristics than our current core businesses; challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects; contingent liabilities (including contingent tax liabilities and earn-out obligations) that are larger than expected; and potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquired companies. The goodwill and intangible assets recorded in past acquisitions were significant, and in future acquisitions could be significant, and impairment of such assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with joint venture investments may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have entered into several joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we may compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner’s consent to take certain actions. Our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. Additionally, the financial performance of our joint ventures has resulted in, and in the future could result in, the Company having to record losses or impairments of our investment. These risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions\nSome of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and, accordingly, demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries.\nMuch of the demand for our products, services and solutions is driven by\ncommercial, institutional, industrial, data center, governmental and residential\nconstruction, industrial facility expansion, retrofit activity, maintenance projects and other capital investments in buildings within the sectors that we serve. Construction and other capital investment projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, localized demand for real estate and availability of credit\n, public funding or other sources of financing\n. Some of the real estate markets we serve are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand. In addition, most real estate developers rely heavily on project financing in order to initiate and complete projects. Declines in real estate values and increases in prevailing interest rates could lead to significant reductions in the demand for and availability of project financing, even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction. These factors could in turn temper demand for new building products and solutions and have a corresponding impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLevels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance are dependent on general economic conditions, economic conditions within specific industries we serve, expectations of future market behavior and available financing. The businesses of many of our industrial customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns. During such economic downturns, customers in these industries tend to delay major capital projects, including greenfield construction, maintenance projects and upgrades. Additionally, demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy, component and commodity prices, commodity and component availability and fluctuating demand forecasts, as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning, which may reduce demand for our products and services as projects are postponed or cancelled. Increases in prevailing interest rates or disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could significantly raise the cost of new debt for our customers. Any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a\n19\nnegative effect on investment in large capital projects, including necessary maintenance and upgrades, even during periods of favorable end-market conditions.\nMany of our customers inside and outside of the industrial and commercial sectors, including governmental and institutional customers, have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue have been negatively impacted by adverse or stagnant economic conditions, including sustained increases in interest rates. These budgetary constraints have in the past, and may in the future, reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers.\nReduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks associated with our non-U.S. operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant operations in a number of countries outside the U.S., some of which are located in emerging markets. Long-term economic and geopolitical uncertainty in any of the regions of the world in which we operate, such as Asia, South America, the Middle East, Europe and emerging markets, could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from our operations to cover our capital needs and debt service requirements. During fiscal year 2024, our results of operations were impacted by continued softening of economic conditions in China, negatively impacting the performance of the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment. The continuation of economic weakness in China or in other regions could adversely impact our financial performance in such regions, as well as our consolidated financial performance.\nIn addition, as a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are therefore subject to non-U.S. currency risks and non-U.S. exchange exposure. While we employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure, these activities do not insulate us completely from those exposures. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the U.S. and adversely impact the comparability of results from period to period. During 2022 through 2024, we experienced a reduction in revenue and profits as a result of the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar could continue to adversely impact our revenue and profit in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThere are other risks that are inherent in our non-U.S. operations, including the potential for changes in socio-economic conditions, laws and regulations, including anti-trust, labor and environmental laws, and monetary and fiscal policies; the ability to enforce rights, collect revenues and protect assets in foreign jurisdictions; protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures, or impact trade volumes; unsettled or unstable political conditions; international conflict; government-imposed plant or other operational shutdowns; backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions; corruption; natural and man-made disasters, hazards and losses; violence, civil and labor unrest, and possible terrorist attacks. These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign trade policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nGeopolitical tensions and trade disputes can disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of our products. This could cause our products to be more expensive for customers, which could reduce the demand for or attractiveness of such products. In addition, a geopolitical conflict in a region where we operate could disrupt our ability to conduct business operations in that region. Countries also could adopt restrictive trade measures, such as tariffs, laws and regulations concerning investments and limitations on foreign ownership of businesses, taxation, foreign exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations and the repatriation of earnings and controls on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, any of which could adversely affect our operations and supply chain and limit our ability to offer our products and services as intended. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials (either directly or through our suppliers) could have an impact on our competitive position, business operations and financial results. For example, the U.S., China and other countries continue to implement restrictive trade actions, including tariffs, export controls, sanctions, legislation favoring domestic investment and other actions impacting the import and export of goods, foreign investment and foreign operations in jurisdictions in which we operate. These kinds of restrictions could be adopted with little to no advanced notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate the adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty\n20\nsurrounding trade or other international disputes also could have a negative impact on customer confidence and willingness to spend money, which could impair our future growth. Any of these events could increase the cost of our products, create disruptions to our supply chain and impair our ability to effectively operate and compete in the countries where we do business.\nEconomic, political, credit and capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance, our ability to grow or sustain our business and our ability to access the capital markets.\nWe compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets. Global economic and political conditions affect each of our primary businesses and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. Recessions, economic downturns, price instability, inflation, slowing economic growth and social and political instability in the industries and/or markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance in future periods, result in future restructuring charges, and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our business. For example, recent and ongoing macroeconomic and political instability caused by rising interest rates, global supply chain disruptions, inflation, ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine as well as Israel and Hamas, geopolitical tensions and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have and could continue to adversely impact our results of operations. Other consequences arising from ongoing conflicts, the further escalation of geopolitical tensions globally and their effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted. This may include economic sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, expansion of current conflicts, energy instability, retaliatory action by governments, supply chain disruptions, disruption to local markets, increased cybersecurity attacks against us, our third-party service providers and customers, collateral consequences from cyber conflicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure. and increased tensions among countries in which we operate. Our failure to adequately react to these and other political and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our business beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide. A worldwide economic downturn and/or disruption of the credit markets could reduce our access to capital necessary for our operations and executing our strategic plan. In addition, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, increased capital costs due to increases in global interest rates. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, or if costs of capital increased significantly due to increased interest rates, lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors; then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nVolatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIncreases in commodity costs can negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on such orders are typically fixed; therefore, in the short-term, our ability to adjust for changes in certain commodity prices is limited. In these cases, if we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through price increases to our customers on new orders, then such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply-based fixed-price contracts, we use commodity hedge contracts to minimize overall price risk associated with our anticipated commodity purchases. Unfavourability in our hedging programs during a period of declining commodity prices could result in lower margins as we reduce prices to match the market on a fixed commodity cost level. Additionally, to the extent we do not or are unable to hedge certain commodities and the commodity prices substantially increase, such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDuring fiscal 2022 and 2023, we at times experienced increased commodity costs as a result of global macroeconomic trends, including global price inflation, supply chain disruption and international conflict. We\ncould experience further cost fluctuations in the future, which\ncould negatively impact our results of operations to the extent we are unable to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of increased costs.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nOur businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations.\nOur operations and employees are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local licensing laws, codes and standards and similar foreign laws, codes, standards and regulations. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses. Competition or other regulatory investigations can continue for several years, be costly to defend and can result in\n21\nsubstantial fines. If laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and various non U.S. governmental agencies, including applicable export controls, anti-trust, customs, currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations, laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets, and laws governing certain materials that may be in our products. No assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations.\nWe are also subject to a complex network of tax laws and tax treaties that impact our effective tax rate. For more information on risks related to tax regulation, see “Risks Related to Tax Matters” below.\nWe cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are subject to requirements relating to environmental and safety regulations and environmental remediation matters which could adversely affect our business, results of operation and reputation.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, solid and hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal, and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future, which could increase costs of compliance, decrease demand for  our products, create reputational harm or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials. For example, our Tyco Fire Protection Products business discontinued the production and sale of fluorinated firefighting foams in fiscal 2024, including Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (\"AFFF\") and related products, and has transitioned to non-fluorinated foam alternatives.\nFederal, state and local authorities also regulate a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, health, safety laws governing employee injuries, and permitting requirements in addition to the environmental matters discussed above. If we are unable to adequately comply with applicable health and safety regulations and provide our employees with a safe working environment, we may be subject to litigation and regulatory action, in addition to negatively impacting our ability to attract and retain talented employees. New legislation and regulations may require us to make material changes to our operations, resulting in significant increases to the cost of production. Additionally, violations of environmental, health and safety laws are subject to civil, and, in some cases, criminal sanctions. As a result of these uncertainties, we may incur unexpected interruptions to operations, fines, penalties or other reductions in income which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws around the world.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and require that companies maintain accurate books and records. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and local customs and practices that can be inconsistent with anti-bribery laws. We cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will preclude reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third-party intermediaries. Where we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, or if we are subject to allegations of any such violations, we have and will investigate the allegations and from time to time as necessary may engage outside counsel to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of such compliance matters, which also could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n22\nWe are subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the U.S. government.\nOur customers include many U.S. federal, state and local government authorities. Doing business with the U.S. federal, state and local governments subjects us to certain particular risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations. Agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for failure to perform under the applicable contract. We are subject to potential government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations, which can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been made in the past that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that have moved their corporate location abroad. We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.\nRisks Related to Litigation\nPotential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.\nWe have projects underway at multiple current and former manufacturing and testing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties, including our Fire Technology Center and Stanton Street manufacturing facility located in Marinette, Wisconsin. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including arsenic, solvent, oil, metal, lead, PFOS, PFOA and/or other per- and polyfluorinated substances (\"PFAS\") and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and structure decontamination and demolition, including asbestos abatement. Governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating PFAS, which is contained in certain of the Company's legacy firefighting foam products. These regulations include declining emission standards and limits set as to the presence of certain compounds. Because of uncertainties associated with environmental regulation and environmental remediation activities at sites where we may be liable, future expenses that we may incur to remediate identified sites and resolve outstanding litigation could be considerably higher than the current accrued liability on our consolidated statements of financial position, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we have been named, along with others, in a number of class action and other lawsuits relating to the use of fire-fighting foam products by the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. military and others for fire suppression purposes and related training exercises. It is difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure represented by these matters. Such claims may also negatively affect our reputation. See Note 21, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters.\nWe are party to asbestos-related product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries, along with numerous other third parties, are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components. We cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits on satisfactory terms in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief. Unfavorable rulings, judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 21, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters.\nLegal proceedings in which we are, or may be, a party may adversely affect us.\nWe are currently, and may in the future, become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers, intellectual property matters, third party liability, including product liability claims, and employment claims. In addition, we may be exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions, or system failure, in our fire and security businesses than may not be inherent in other businesses. In particular, because many of our fire and security products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property, we may have greater exposure to\n23\nlitigation risks than other businesses. The nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures. As a result, such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Tax Matters\nFuture potential changes to the tax laws could adversely affect us and our affiliates.\nLegislative and regulatory action may be taken in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, which, if ultimately enacted, could result in an increase in our effective tax rate. For example, if the U.S or other jurisdictions override tax treaties upon which we rely, or broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a U.S. resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals and such changes could have a prospective or retroactive application. However, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in Ireland or limiting Johnson Controls International plc’s ability, as an Irish company, to take advantage of tax treaties with the U.S., we could be subject to increased taxation, potentially significant expense, and/or other adverse tax consequences.\nIn October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\")/G20 inclusive framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Inclusive Framework) published a statement updating and finalizing the key components of a two-pillar plan on global tax reform which has now been agreed upon by the majority of OECD members. Pillar One allows countries to reallocate a portion of residual profits earned by multinational enterprises (\"MNE\"), with an annual global revenue exceeding €20 billion and a profit margin over 10%, to other market jurisdictions. The adoption of Pillar One and its potential effective date remain uncertain. Pillar Two requires MNEs with an annual global revenue exceeding €750 million to pay a global minimum tax of 15%. The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2025. We are continuing to evaluate the impact on future periods of Pillar Two, including legislative updates and adoption by additional countries, which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate.\nFuture potential changes to the U.S. tax laws could result in us being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") may not agree that we should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nBecause Johnson Controls International plc is organized under the laws of Ireland, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, Section 7874 of the Code (\"Section 7874\") provides an exception to this general rule under which a non-U.S. incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. The IRS may assert that, as a result of the Merger, Johnson Controls International plc should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS may also assert that the ability of our U.S. affiliates to utilize U.S. tax attributes, such as net operating losses and certain tax credits, to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions may be limited under Section 7874. The application of these rules could result in significant additional U.S. tax liability. In addition, a retroactive change to U.S. tax laws in this area could change the tax classification of Johnson Controls International plc. If it were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation.\nBased on the terms of the Merger, we currently expect that Section 7874 does not apply to us or our affiliates as a result of the Merger. However, determining the applicability of Section 7874 is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties. Thus, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the position that Johnson Controls International plc should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes or that Section 7874 does not otherwise apply.\nChanges to the U.S. model income tax treaty could adversely affect us.\nOn February 17, 2016, the U.S. Treasury released a revised U.S. model income tax convention (the \"new model\"), which is the baseline text used by the U.S. Treasury to negotiate tax treaties. If any or all of the modifications to the model treaty are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business, they could, among other things, cause double taxation, increase audit risk and substantially increase our worldwide tax liability. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific modifications to the model treaty, and we cannot provide assurance that any such modifications will not apply to us.\n24\nNegative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to additional changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on our statement of financial position, and the future sale of certain businesses could potentially result in the reversal of outside basis differences that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, changes in tax laws in the U.S., Ireland or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position and our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of income.\nWe are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities. Negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation\nIrish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nIt may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.\nAs an Irish company, Johnson Controls is governed by the Irish Companies Acts, which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Johnson Controls International plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.\nTransfers of Johnson Controls ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty.\nFor the majority of transfers of Johnson Controls ordinary shares, there is no Irish stamp duty. However, Irish stamp duty is payable for certain share transfers. A transfer of Johnson Controls ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially (i.e., through the Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\")) to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially is not subject to Irish stamp duty (unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares). A transfer of Johnson Controls ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly (i.e., not through DTC) to any buyer, or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly, may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer. A shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to Johnson Controls transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and, at the time of the transfer, there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares.\nWe currently intend to pay, or cause one of our affiliates to pay, stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially. In other cases, Johnson Controls may, in its absolute discretion, pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty. Johnson Controls Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that, in the event of any such payment, Johnson Controls (i) may seek reimbursement from the buyer, (ii) may have a lien against the Johnson Controls ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and (iii) may set-off the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares. Parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in Johnson Controls ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by Johnson Controls.\n25\nDividends paid by us may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.\nIn certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, we will be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 25%) from dividends paid to our shareholders. Shareholders that are residents in the U.S., European Union countries (other than Ireland) or other countries with which Ireland has signed a tax treaty (whether the treaty has been ratified or not) generally should not be subject to Irish withholding tax so long as the shareholder has provided certain Irish dividend withholding tax forms. However, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares.\nDividends received by investors could be subject to Irish income tax.\nDividends paid in respect of Johnson Controls ordinary shares generally are not subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax, unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Johnson Controls.\nJohnson Controls shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Johnson Controls.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services, or who purchase goods and services from us, will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress. If third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us, we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us. In such events, we may incur losses, or our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected.\nRisks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nSignificant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates, mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and the amounts of contributions we must make to our defined benefit plans in future periods. Because we mark-to-market our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis, large non-cash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when a remeasurement event occurs. Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon, among other factors, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations.\nA variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our business.\nAny of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our business: loss of, changes in, or failure to perform under guaranteed performance contracts with our major customers; cancellation of, or significant delays in, projects in our backlog; delays or difficulties in new product development; our ability to recognize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions, downgrades in the ratings of our debt, material increases to our level of indebtedness, products and services that we are unable to pass on to the market; changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their building control systems; and natural or man-made disasters or losses that impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers."

    "text": "Cybersecurity Strategy and Risk Management\nThe Company faces a wide variety of cybersecurity threats ranging from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (\"IT\") systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the Company, its products, its customers, supply chain and/or its third-party service providers, including cloud providers. These threats and incidents originate from many sources globally.\nThe Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards, and procedures apply to all users, creating awareness of threats and the importance of information security and cybersecurity across the Company’s workforce. The policies and standards were created using elements of recognized standards such as ISO 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for the overall enterprise and ISA/IEC 62443 for automation and control system products. The Company has implemented cybersecurity policies throughout its operations, including designing and incorporating cybersecurity into the development process for its products and services. The Company’s enterprise risk management (“ERM”) process considers cybersecurity threat risks alongside other significant risks as part of the Company’s overall risk assessment process.\nThe Company\nleverages\nmultiple channels to promote cybersecurity topics, deliver targeted initial\nand refresher training for all users, and conduct an annual mandatory global information security training campaign with certification, which is translated into 20 languages, and ongoing awareness campaigns.\nThese elements are designed to maintain\na risk aware culture.\nThe Company\nmaintains a 24 x 7 operations center that monitors the Company’s IT environment, and coordinates the investigation and remediation of alerts. As cybersecurity events occur, the cybersecurity team focuses on responding to and containing the threat and minimizing impact. In the event of an incident, the cybersecurity team assesses, among other factors, supply chain and manufacturing disruption, data and personal information loss, business operations disruption, projected cost and potential for reputational harm, with participation from technical, legal and law enforcement support, as appropriate.\nThe Company’s\nvulnerability management program conducts assessments with specified frequencies for specific asset types to validate\nsystem health against known threats. The Company\nleverages multiple tools, which are routinely updated with new\nthreat\nsignatures, to continually respond to evolving threats identified as part of its threat detection capability. The Company\nalso\nmaintains a cybersecurity insurance policy.\nThe Company engages with third parties to perform security assessments of its technology environment to perform penetration testing and maturity assessment as well as providing services to support threat analysis and incident detection and response.\nCybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of the Company’s third-party product and service providers. The Company performs due diligence on third parties that have access to its critical systems and data and whose products and services are integrated into the Company’s products. Contractual undertakings and oversight are put in place,\nbased on the results of the risk\nassessment\nto manage\nand reduce the cybersecurity risk associated with such third-party providers. Such undertakings may\ninclude requirements to comply with administrative, technical\nand physical safeguards to provide notification of cyber incidents involving the Company’s systems or data and agreements to be subject to cybersecurity audits, which the Company conducts\nas appropriate\n.\nThe Company requires compliance with appropriate certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.) depending on the offering, region of use, and other factors.\nDuring the weekend of September 23, 2023, the Company experienced a cybersecurity incident impacting its internal\nIT infrastructure and applications. The incident caused disruptions and limitation of access to portions of the Company's business applications supporting aspects of the Company's operations and corporate functions. The impact of the incident included lost and deferred revenues, primarily attributable to order processing and\nlogistics disruptions and delays,\nand expenses\nassociated with the response to, and remediation of, the incident. Further, the cybersecurity incident caused disruptions to certain of the Company’s billing systems, which negatively impacted cash provided from continuing operations primarily during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The overall impact of the cybersecurity incident did not have a material impact on net income, net of insurance recoveries, or cash flows from operations for the full year fiscal 2024.\nCybersecurity Governance\nThe Company’s Board of Directors (the \"Board”) has oversight of the management of the most significant risks facing the Company, including cybersecurity. The Board receives information technology and cybersecurity updates from senior management, including the Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) and Chief Technology Officer, several times per year. These updates cover the cybersecurity risks facing the Company’s enterprise information\n27\ntechnology environment, as well as the Company’s digital products and services. Regular oversight of cybersecurity matters is further delegated by the Board to the Governance and Sustainability Committee.\nThe Governance and Sustainability Committee provides a deeper level of oversight through quarterly engagements with senior management, including the Chief Information Officer and CISO, to review the Company’s cybersecurity program, including the highest risk areas and key mitigation strategies.\nThe Company maintains a Cybersecurity Steering Committee (\"CSC\") designed to ensure effective governance of risks associated with the Company’s use of information and technology assets and demonstrate effective governance of cybersecurity risk. The CSC is chaired by the CISO, and includes the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Information Officer, and other senior representatives from the Company’s business segments and functions. The CSC meets quarterly to monitor the current risk landscape and active risk reduction efforts. Through this review and monitoring activity, the CSC oversees effective governance of IT Risk Management in the Enterprise IT Portfolio, drives accountability and transparency of control effectiveness, and facilitates risk remediation and mitigation in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.\nThe CISO is appointed by the Chief Information Officer and is responsible for cybersecurity risk management across the Company. The CISO leads a global enterprise security team responsible for enterprise-wide security strategy, architecture, engineering, and operations. The Cybersecurity Steering Committee has granted authority to the CISO to pause or stop business processes during the execution of cybersecurity incident response duties if they deem it necessary. The CSC maintains approval authority for the Company’s Enterprise Information Security Policy.\nThe CISO has over 20 years of technology experience including cybersecurity, infrastructure, architecture, and data and analytics in highly regulated industries including healthcare and aviation\nand defense. The CISO has an undergraduate degree in\nComputer Information Systems\n."

    "text": "General\nJohnson Controls International plc, headquartered in Cork, Ireland, is a global leader in smart, healthy and sustainable buildings, serving a wide range of customers in more than 150 countries. The Company’s products, services, systems and solutions advance the safety, comfort and intelligence of spaces to serve people, places and the planet. The Company is committed to helping its customers win and creating greater value for all of its stakeholders through its strategic focus on buildings.\nThe Company is a global leader in engineering, manufacturing, commissioning and retrofitting building products and systems, including residential and commercial HVAC equipment, industrial refrigeration systems, controls, security systems, fire-detection systems and fire-suppression solutions. The Company further serves customers by providing technical services, including maintenance, management, repair, retrofit and replacement of equipment (in the HVAC, industrial refrigeration, controls, security and fire-protection space), energy-management consulting. The Company's OpenBlue digital software platform enables enterprises to better manage their physical spaces by combining the Company's building products and services with cutting-edge technology and digital capabilities to enable data-driven “smart building” services and solutions. The Company partners with customers by leveraging its broad product portfolio and digital capabilities, powered by OpenBlue, together with its direct channel service and solutions capabilities, to deliver outcome-based solutions across the lifecycle of a building that address customers’ needs to improve energy efficiency, enhance security, create healthy environments and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on September 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years. This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity of the Company on a continuing operations basis for the year ended September 30, 2024 and should be read in conjunction with Item 8, the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nMacroeconomic Trends\nMuch of the demand for the Company’s products and solutions is driven by construction, facility expansion, retrofit and maintenance projects within the commercial, institutional, industrial, data center, governmental and residential sectors. Construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, localized demand for real estate and the availability of credit, public funding or other financing sources. Positive or negative fluctuations in construction, industrial facility expansion, retrofit activity, maintenance projects and other capital investments in buildings within the sectors that the Company serves, as well as availability of credit, financing or funding for such projects, could have a corresponding impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. During fiscal 2024, the Company observed continued softening of economic conditions in China, negatively impacting the performance of the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment. The Company expects economic conditions in China to stabilize in fiscal 2025, however, if conditions do not stabilize, results of the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment could be negatively impacted.\nAs a result of the Company’s global presence, a significant portion of its revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is therefore subject to non-U.S. currency risks and non-U.S. exchange exposure. While the Company employs financial instruments to hedge some of its transactional foreign exchange exposure, these activities do not insulate it completely from those exposures. In addition, the currency exposure from the translation of non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are not able to be hedged. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could increase or reduce the Company’s profit margin, respectively, and impact the comparability of results from period to period. During fiscal 2024, revenue and profits were negatively impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company continues to observe trends demonstrating increased interest and demand for its products and services that enable smart, safe, efficient and sustainable buildings, particularly within verticals including data centers, government, healthcare and higher education. This demand is driven in part by capital investment, government tax incentives, building performance standards and regulations designed to limit emissions and combat climate change. In particular, legislative and regulatory initiatives such as the U.S. Climate Smart Buildings Initiative, U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive include provisions designed to fund and encourage investment in decarbonization and digital technologies for buildings. This demand is supplemented by an increase in commitments in both the public and private sectors to reduce emissions and/or achieve net zero emissions. The Company seeks to capitalize on these trends to drive growth by developing\n32\nand delivering technologies and solutions to create smart, sustainable and healthy buildings. The Company is investing in new digital and product capabilities, including its OpenBlue platform, to enable it to deliver sustainable, high-efficiency products and tailored services to enable customers to achieve their objectives. The Company is leveraging its install base, together with data-driven products and services to offer outcome-based solutions to customers with a focus on generating accelerated growth in services and recurring revenue.\nThe Company has experienced, and could continue to experience, increased material cost inflation and component shortages, as well as disruptions and delays in its supply chain, as a result of global macroeconomic trends, including increased global demand, geopolitical and economic tensions, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, and labor shortages. Actions taken by the Company to mitigate supply chain disruptions and inflation, including expanding and redistributing its supplier network, supplier financing, price increases and productivity improvements, have historically been successful in offsetting some, but not all, of the impact of these trends. The collective impact of these trends has been favorable to revenue due to increased demand and price increases to offset inflation, while negatively impacting margins primarily due to ongoing cost pressures.\nAlthough the Company has experienced recent stabilization, it could experience further disruptions, and shortages and cost increases could occur in the future, the effect of which will depend on the Company’s ability to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of these events.\nThe extent to which the Company’s results of operations and financial condition are impacted by these and other factors in the future will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. See Part I, Item 1A, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of risks.\nPortfolio Simplification Transactions\nThe Company has been engaged in an ongoing evaluation of its non-core product lines in connection with its objective to be a pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions for commercial buildings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Air Distribution Technologies business included within the Global Products segment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Residential and Light Commercial (\"R&LC\") HVAC business to Robert Bosch GmbH (“Bosch”) for approximately $8.1 billion in cash with the Company's portion of the aggregate consideration being approximately $6.7 billion, inclusive of an upfront royalty payment for the licensing of the York tradename. The R&LC HVAC business includes the Company's North America Ducted business and Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning Holding (UK) Ltd., the Company’s global residential joint venture with Hitachi Global Life Solutions, Inc. (“Hitachi”), of which the Company owns 60% and Hitachi owns 40%. The R&LC HVAC business, which was previously reported in the Global Products segment, meets the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and, as a result, its historical financial results are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation, and assets and liabilities were reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented. The Company expects that the sale of the R&LC HVAC business will close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\nCybersecurity Incident\nDuring the weekend of September 23, 2023, the Company experienced a cybersecurity incident impacting its internal information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure and applications. The cybersecurity incident consisted of unauthorized access, data exfiltration and deployment of ransomware by a third party to a portion of the Company's internal IT infrastructure. The incident caused disruptions and limitation of access to portions of the Company's business applications supporting aspects of the Company's operations and corporate functions, which disruptions and limitations continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nThe Company’s investigation and remediation efforts remain ongoing, including the analysis of data accessed, exfiltrated or otherwise impacted during the cybersecurity incident. Based on the information reviewed to date, the Company has not observed evidence of any impact to its digital products, services and solutions, including OpenBlue and Metasys.\nThe overall impact of the cybersecurity incident did not have a material impact on net income, net of insurance recoveries, or cash flows from operations in fiscal 2024.\nThe Company maintains insurance covering certain losses associated with cybersecurity incidents. A substantial portion of  direct costs incurred related to containing, investigating and remediating the incident, as well as business interruption losses, have been or are expected to be reimbursed through insurance recoveries. The timing of recognizing insurance recoveries may differ from the timing of recognizing the associated expenses.\n33\nRestructuring and Cost Optimization Initiatives\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company committed to a multi-year restructuring plan to address stranded costs and further right-size its global operations as a result of previously announced portfolio simplification actions. It is expected that one-time restructuring costs, including severance and other employee termination benefits, contract termination costs, and certain other related cash and non-cash charges, of approximately $400 million will be incurred over the course of fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027, resulting in expected annual cost savings of approximately $500 million upon full completion of the plan. The Company’s ability to execute the most significant aspects of the restructuring plan will be dependent on the timing of the close of the R&LC HVAC business divestiture transaction. Accordingly, the Company is unable to estimate the specific costs to be incurred and savings to be achieved in fiscal 2025; however, depending on the timing of the closing of the transaction and the ability to execute more significant aspects of the planned restructuring actions, the impact of costs on net income could be material in fiscal 2025. Restructuring costs will be incurred across all segments and Corporate functions.\nFISCAL YEAR 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2023\nNet Sales\nThe increase in net sales was due to higher organic sales ($790 million), partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($98 million) and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures ($71 million). Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and business acquisitions and divestitures, consolidated net sales increased 4% over the prior year, as strong growth in Products and Systems in the Building Solutions North America segment and growth in Services in all Building Solutions segments were partially offset primarily by weakness in China's Systems/Install business. Refer to the \"Segment Analysis\" below within Item 7 for a discussion of net sales by segment.\nCost of Sales / Gross Profit\nThe increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher gross profit in the Systems/Install and Services businesses of the Building Solutions segments, partially offset by the Global Products segment. Refer to the \"Segment Analysis\" below within Item 7 for a discussion of segment earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (\"EBITA\").\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") was primarily due to the net impact of the water systems AFFF settlement agreement costs net of insurance recoveries ($383 million), partially offset by the year-over-year impact of net mark-to-market adjustments ($100 million) and productivity improvements. Refer to the \"Segment Analysis\" below within Item 7 for a discussion of segment EBITA.\n34\nRestructuring and Impairment Costs\nRefer to Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" \"Note 3, \"Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations,\" Note 7, \"Property, Plant and Equipment,\" Note 8, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" and Note 17, \"Restructuring and Related Costs,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosure related to the Company's restructuring plans and impairment costs.\nNet Financing Charges\n* Measure not meaningful\nRefer to Note 10, \"Debt and Financing Arrangements,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosure related to the Company's debt.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\n* Measure not meaningful\nThe fiscal 2024 effective tax rate was higher than fiscal 2023 primarily due to the establishment of a deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference of the Company’s investment in certain subsidiaries as a result of the planned divestiture of its R&LC HVAC business, partially offset by lower tax reserve adjustments as the result of tax audit resolutions and expired statute of limitations for certain tax years, valuation allowance adjustments and the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives. Refer to Note 18, \"Income Taxes,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details.\nIn October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\")/G20 inclusive framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Inclusive Framework) published a statement updating and finalizing the key components of a two-pillar plan on global tax reform which has now been agreed upon by the majority of OECD members. Pillar One allows countries to reallocate a portion of residual profits earned by multinational enterprises (\"MNE\"), with an annual global revenue exceeding €20 billion and a profit margin over 10%, to other market jurisdictions. The adoption of Pillar One and its potential effective date remain uncertain. Pillar Two requires MNEs with an annual global revenue exceeding €750 million to pay a\n35\nglobal minimum tax of 15%. The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2025.\nThe Company continues to evaluate the impact on future periods of Pillar Two, including legislative updates and adoption by additional countries, which could result in an increase to the effective tax rate.\nIncome From Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nThe increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax was primarily due to decreased SG&A as a result of productivity improvements. Refer to Note 3, \"Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.\nFISCAL YEAR 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2022\nNet Sales\nThe increase in net sales was due to higher organic sales ($1,947 million) and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures ($113 million), partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($366 million). Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and business acquisitions and divestitures, consolidated net sales increased 9% over the prior year, attributable to increased pricing in response to inflation pressures. Refer to the \"Segment Analysis\" below within Item 7 for a discussion of net sales by segment.\nCost of Sales / Gross Profit\nGross profit increased due to organic sales growth and favorable price/cost, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and the year-over-year impact of net pension mark-to-market adjustments ($42 million). Refer to the \"Segment Analysis\" below within Item 7 for a discussion of segment earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (\"EBITA\").\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in SG&A was primarily due to certain investments to support growth, transaction and separation costs, the year-over-year impact of net mark-to-market adjustments ($71 million) and a loss associated with a fire at a leased warehouse facility ($40 million), partially offset by the absence of non-recurring environmental remediation charges in the prior year ($255\n36\nmillion) and positive foreign currency translation. Refer to the \"Segment Analysis\" below within Item 7 for a discussion of segment EBITA.\nRestructuring and Impairment Costs\nRefer to Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" Note 3, \"Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations,\" Note 7, \"Property, Plant and Equipment,\" Note 8, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" and Note 17, \"Restructuring and Related Costs,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosure related to the Company's restructuring plans and impairment costs.\nNet Financing Charges\nRefer to Note 10, \"Debt and Financing Arrangements,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosure related to the Company's debt.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\n* Measure not meaningful\nThe statutory tax rate in Ireland of 12.5% is being used as a comparison since the Company is domiciled in Ireland.\nFor fiscal 2023, the effective tax rate for continuing operations was (42)% and was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the favorable tax impacts of intellectual property tax adjustments, tax reserve adjustments as the result of tax audit resolutions and remeasurements, valuation allowance adjustments and the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of impairment and restructuring charges.\nFor fiscal 2022, the effective tax rate for continuing operations was (16%) and was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the favorable impact of tax reserve adjustments as the result of expired statute of limitations for certain tax years and the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of impairment and restructuring charges and the establishment of a deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference of the Company's investment in certain subsidiaries as a result of the planned divestitures.\n37\nIncome From Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nThe increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax was primarily due to decreased SG&A as a result of productivity improvements. Refer to Note 3, \"Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale & Discontinued Operations,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.\nSEGMENT ANALYSIS\nManagement evaluates the performance of its segments primarily on segment earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (\"EBITA\"), which represents income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding  amortization of intangible assets, corporate expenses, restructuring and impairment costs, the water systems AFFF settlement costs and AFFF insurance recoveries, net financing charges, loss on divestiture and net mark-to-market gains and losses related to pension and postretirement plans and restricted asbestos investments.\nNet Sales\n•\nThe increase in Building Solutions North America was due to organic growth ($957 million), incremental sales related to business acquisitions ($48 million) and the positive impact of foreign currency translation ($13 million). Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation and business acquisitions, sales growth was led by growth in Applied HVAC & Controls.\n•\nThe increase in Building Solutions EMEA/LA was due to organic growth, including higher prices ($233 million) and the net impact of business acquisitions and divestitures ($6 million), partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($39 million). Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and business acquisitions and divestitures, sales growth was led by growth in Services.\n•\nThe decrease in Building Solutions Asia Pacific was primarily due to organic sales declines ($440 million), the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($62 million) and the net impact of business acquisitions and divestitures ($7 million). Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and business acquisitions and divestitures, sales decreased as Services growth was more than offset by weakness in the China Systems business.\n•\nThe decrease in Global Products was due to the net impact of business acquisitions and divestitures ($118 million) and the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($10 million), partially offset by organic growth ($40 million)\n. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation and business acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased as growth in Commercial HVAC was more than offset by declines in Fire & Security and Industrial Refrigeration.\nSegment EBITA\n•\nThe increase in Building Solutions North America was primarily due to higher margin backlog conversion and continued growth in Services. A favorable earn-out liability adjustment also contributed to the increase.\n38\n•\nThe increase in Building Solutions EMEA/LA was primarily due to growth in higher margin Services and productivity improvements.\n•\nThe decrease in Building Solutions Asia Pacific was primarily due to continued weakness in the Systems business in China.\n•\nThe increase in Global Products was primarily driven by operational efficiencies leading to productivity improvements.\nNet Sales\n•\nThe increase in Building Solutions North America was due to organic growth, including higher prices ($979 million) and incremental sales related to business acquisitions ($29 million), partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($45 million). Excluding the impacts of business acquisitions and foreign currency translation, sales growth was led by growth in HVAC & Controls and Fire & Security.\n•\nThe increase in Building Solutions EMEA/LA was due to organic growth, including higher prices ($324 million) and the net impact of business acquisitions and divestitures ($29 million), partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($102 million). Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation and business acquisitions and divestitures, sales growth was led by growth in Fire & Security and HVAC & Controls.\n•\nThe increase in Building Solutions Asia Pacific was due to organic growth, including higher prices ($182 million) and the net impact of business acquisitions and divestitures ($19 million), partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($169 million). The economic conditions in China, specifically challenges in real estate, began negatively impacting the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, but had an insignificant impact on results for the full year. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation and business acquisitions and divestitures, sales growth was led by continued demand for HVAC & Controls.\n•\nThe increase in Global Products was due to the net impact of higher prices and lower volumes ($462 million) and incremental sales related to business acquisitions ($36 million), partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($50 million). Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation and business acquisitions, sales growth was driven by strong price realization and growth in Commercial HVAC and Industrial Refrigeration products.\nSegment EBITA\n•\nThe increase in Building Solutions North America was primarily due to favorable price/cost, volume leverage and productivity savings, partially offset by unfavorable project mix.\n•\nThe decrease in Building Solutions EMEA/LA reflects the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($13 million) and higher expenses, partially offset by favorable price/cost.\n•\nThe increase in Building Solutions Asia Pacific was primarily due to favorable price/cost and productivity savings, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation ($25 million).\n39\n•\nThe increase in Global Products was primarily due to favorable price/cost and productivity savings, partially offset by unfavorable mix, lower gross margin due to lower manufacturing absorption, an uninsured loss associated with a fire at a leased warehouse facility and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWorking Capital\n* Measure not meaningful\n•\nThe Company defines working capital as current assets less current liabilities, excluding cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, the current portion of long-term debt, and current assets and liabilities held for sale (when applicable). Management believes that this measure of working capital, which excludes financing-related items and businesses to be divested, provides a more useful measurement of the Company’s operating performance.\n•\nThe increase in working capital (as defined) at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to discontinuing the receivable factoring program during the current year, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue and accrued compensation and benefits.\nCash Flows From Continuing Operations\n•\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities reflects lower net income and the impact of higher accounts receivable and other asset balances, which was partially offset by the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities payments.\n•\nThe decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to the net impact of proceeds from the ADTi divestiture in fiscal 2024 and cash paid for the FM:Systems acquisition in fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n•\nThe decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to changes in short- and long-term borrowing activity and stock repurchase activity. The net impact of debt proceeds and repayments generated cash of $405 million\n40\nin fiscal 2024 and used cash of $457 million in fiscal 2023. This increase in cash used was substantially offset by higher stock repurchases.\nCapitalization\n•\nNet debt and net debt as a percentage of total capitalization are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the percentage of total net debt to total capitalization is useful to understanding the Company’s financial condition as it provides a view of the extent to which the Company relies on external debt financing for its funding and is a measure of risk to its shareholders.\n•\nThe Company's material cash requirements primarily consist of working capital requirements, repayments of long-term debt and related interest, operating leases, dividends, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and share repurchases.\n•\nRefer to Note 10, \"Debt and Financing Arrangements,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on debt obligations and maturities. Interest payable on long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 is $299 million in the twelve months following September 30, 2024 and $3.4 billion thereafter.\n•\nRefer to Note 9, \"Leases,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on lease obligations and maturities.\n•\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had purchase obligations which were payable in the next twelve months of approximately $2 billion and payable thereafter of approximately $120 million, substantially all of which relate to continuing operations. These purchase obligations represent commitments under enforceable and legally binding agreements, and do not represent all future expected purchases.\n•\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company expects to contribute $25 million and $204 million, of which $22 million and $179 million relates to continuing operations,\nto the global pension and postretirement plans in the next twelve months and thereafter, respectively.\n•\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately $1.7 billion remains available under the Company's share repurchase authorization, which does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time depending on market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and economic environment.\n•\nThe Company declared dividends of $1.48 per share in fiscal 2024 and intends to continue paying quarterly dividends in fiscal 2025.\n•\nThe Company believes its capital resources and liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents of $606 million at September 30, 2024, are adequate to fund operations and meet its obligations for the foreseeable future. The Company expects requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, minimum pension contributions,\n41\ndebt maturities and any potential acquisitions or stock repurchases in fiscal 2025 will be funded from operations, supplemented by short- and long-term borrowings, if required.\n–\nThe Company manages its short-term debt position in the U.S. and euro commercial paper markets and bank loan markets. Commercial paper outstanding was $350 million as of September 30, 2024 and $200 million as of September 30, 2023.\n–\nThe Company maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which it may issue additional debt securities, ordinary shares, preferred shares, depository shares, warrants, purchase contracts and units that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. The Company anticipates that the proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchases of ordinary shares, dividends, capital expenditures and investments in the Company's subsidiaries.\n–\nThe Company has the ability to draw on its syndicated $2.5 billion committed revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2028, and a syndicated $500 million committed revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2024. There were no draws on the facilities as of September 30, 2024.\n•\nThe Company's ability to access the global capital markets and the related cost of financing is dependent upon, among other factors, the Company's credit ratings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's credit ratings and outlook were as follows:\nThe security ratings set forth above are issued by unaffiliated third-party rating agencies and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization at any time.\n•\nThe Company entered into the following debt transactions in fiscal 2024:\n–\nRepaid $924 million of debt including the following:\n▪\n$484 million Senior Notes due 2024 with interest rates of 3.625%\n▪\n€300 million term loans with interest rates of Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\" EURIBOR\")  plus 0.4% to 0.7%\n▪\nTendered $119 million of its Notes due 2045 with an interest rate of 5.125%\n–\nIssued $1.3 billion of debt including the following:\n▪\nTogether with its wholly owned subsidiary, Tyco Fire & Security Finance S.C.A., co-issued $700 million in 5.50% Senior Notes due in April 2029\n▪\n€450 million short-term term loans with interest rates of EURIBOR plus 0.65% to 0.78% due in the first quarter of fiscal 2025\n▪\n$100 million short-term term loan with an interest rate of 5.9% which is due in December 2024\n•\nThe Company expects to receive net cash proceeds related to the sale of its R&LC HVAC business of approximately $5.0 billion after tax and transaction-related expenses when the transaction closes, likely in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Consistent with its capital allocation policy, the Company expects to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down debt to the extent required to retain its investment grade rating, with the remaining proceeds expected to be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.\n•\nOn April 12, 2024, Tyco Fire Products agreed to a settlement with a nationwide class of public water systems that detected PFAS in their drinking water systems that they allege to be associated with the use of AFFF. Under the terms of the agreement, Tyco Fire Products agreed to contribute $750 million to resolve these PFAS claims. Tyco Fire Products contributed an initial payment of $250 million in June 2024, with the remaining $500 million due by the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Prior to the date of the final contribution, Tyco Fire Products has agreed to contribute any applicable insurance recoveries in excess of the initial $250 million payment, up to the remaining $500 million due, within a specified period following the receipt of such recovery. During fiscal 2024, the Company recorded expected insurance recoveries of $371 million in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and collected insurance recoveries of $349 million. In accordance with its agreement and recent insurance\n42\nrecovery, Tyco Fire Products made an additional payment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 of approximately $85 million, reducing its final payment to approximately $415 million.\nThe amounts and timing of any additional insurance recoveries are uncertain. Refer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the water systems settlement.\n•\nFinancial covenants in the Company's revolving credit facilities require a minimum consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to Johnson Controls of at least $3.5 billion at all times. The revolving credit facility also limits the amount of debt secured by liens that may be incurred to a maximum aggregated amount of 10% of consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to Johnson Controls for liens and pledges. For purposes of calculating these covenants, consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to Johnson Controls is calculated without giving effect to (i) the application of ASC 715-60, \"Defined Benefit Plans - Other Postretirement,\" or (ii) the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants set forth in its credit agreements and the indentures governing its outstanding notes, and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future. None of the Company’s debt agreements limit access to stated borrowing levels or require accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in the Company's credit rating.\n•\nThe Company earns a significant amount of its income outside of the parent company. Outside basis differences in these subsidiaries are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested except in limited circumstances. However, in fiscal 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense related to a change in the Company's assertion over the outside basis differences of the Company’s investment in certain subsidiaries as a result of the planned divestiture of its R&LC HVAC business. The Company currently does not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate undistributed earnings included in the outside basis differences other than in tax efficient manners. The Company's intent is to reduce basis differences only when it would be tax efficient. The Company expects existing U.S. cash and liquidity to continue to be sufficient to fund the Company’s U.S. operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In the U.S., should the Company require more capital than is generated by its operations, the Company could elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. The Company has borrowed funds in the U.S. and continues to have the ability to borrow funds in the U.S. at reasonable interest rates. In addition, the Company expects existing non-U.S. cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund the Company’s non-U.S. operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should the Company require more capital at the Luxembourg and Ireland holding and financing entities, other than amounts that can be provided in tax efficient methods, the Company could also elect to raise capital through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of the Company’s earnings.\n•\nThe Company may from time to time purchase its outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Purchases or retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nCo-Issued Securities: Summarized Financial Information\nThe following information is provided in compliance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to the following unsecured, unsubordinated senior notes (collectively, \"the Notes\") which were issued by Johnson Controls International plc (\"Parent Company\") and Tyco Fire & Security Finance S.C.A. (“TFSCA”):\n•\n€500 million aggregate principal amount of 0.375% Senior Notes due 2027\n•\n€600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.000% Senior Notes due 2028\n•\n$700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2029\n•\n$625 million aggregate principal amount of 1.750% Senior Notes due 2030\n•\n$500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.000% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2031\n•\n€500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.000% Senior Notes due 2032\n•\n$400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.900% Senior Notes due 2032\n•\n€800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2035\nTFSCA is a corporate partnership limited by shares (\nsociété en commandite par actions\n) incorporated and organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (“Luxembourg”) and is a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company that is 99.924% owned directly by the Parent Company and 0.076% owned by TFSCA’s sole general partner and manager, Tyco Fire & Security S.à r.l., which is itself wholly-owned by the Company. The Parent Company is incorporated and organized under the laws of Ireland. TFSCA is incorporated and organized under the laws of Luxembourg. The bankruptcy, insolvency,\n43\nadministrative, debtor relief and other laws of Luxembourg or Ireland, as applicable, may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could adversely affect noteholders’ ability to enforce their rights under the Notes in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that they may receive.\nThe following table presents the net loss attributable to the Parent Company and TFSCA (collectively, the \"Obligor Group\") and the net income (loss) attributable to intercompany transactions between the Obligor Group and subsidiaries of the Parent Company other than TFSCA (collectively, the \"Non-Obligor Subsidiaries\") which are excluded from the Net loss attributable to the Obligor Group (in millions):\nThe following table presents summarized balance sheet information as of September 30, 2024 (in millions):\nThe same accounting policies as described in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements are used by the Parent Company and each of its subsidiaries in connection with the summarized financial information presented above.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following estimates are considered by management to be the most critical to the understanding of the Company's consolidated financial statements as they require significant judgments that could materially impact the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from certain long-term contracts on an over time basis, with progress towards completion measured using a cost-to-cost input method based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Total estimated costs at completion are based primarily on estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Factors that may result in a change to these estimates include unforeseen engineering problems, construction delays, cost inflation, the performance of subcontractors and major material suppliers, and weather conditions. As a result, changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract. Such estimates are reviewed monthly and any adjustments to the measure of completion are recognized as adjustments to sales and gross profit using the cumulative catch-up method. Estimated losses are recorded when identified.\nFor agreements with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. In order to estimate relative standalone selling price, market data and transfer price studies are utilized. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach or expected cost plus margin approach.\nThe Company assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including discounts, rebates, refunds, credits or other similar sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of\n44\nrevenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. These estimates are based on the amount of consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units, which have been determined to be the Company’s operating segments or one level below the operating segments, using a qualitative assessment or a quantitative test. A qualitative assessment is performed when prior quantitative assessments have resulted in significant excess of fair value over the carrying value of a reporting unit, and consideration of qualitative factors allow the Company to conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit remains greater than its carrying value. When performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To estimate the fair value, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model or estimated sales price for reporting units held for sale. The assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment, and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations. The key assumptions used in the impairment test were management's projections of future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital and long-term growth rates. Although the Company's cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying business, there are significant judgments in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to a reporting unit.\nManagement completed its fiscal 2024 annual impairment test as of July 31, which included a qualitative assessment of all but one of its reporting units. The Company did not identify any qualitative factors that suggest that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying amount, including goodwill, and as such, a quantitative impairment test was not necessary. The Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test of one reporting unit in the Building Solutions EMEA/LA segment with $214 million of goodwill, and its fair value was in excess of its carrying value. However, for this reporting unit, a 200 basis point increase in the discount rate, or a 200 basis point decrease in the revenue growth rates, would cause the fair value to be less than the carrying value. While no impairment was recorded, it is possible that future changes in circumstances could result in a non-cash impairment charge. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as a result of a triggering event and impaired $230 million of goodwill in its Building Solutions EMEA/LA segment.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are also subject to at least annual impairment testing in the fourth fiscal quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks and trade names and are tested for impairment using a relief-from-royalty method. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests. The key assumptions used in the impairment tests were long-term revenue growth projections, weighted-average cost of capital, and the royalty rate. The assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment, and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations.\nThe Company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value. While the Company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests are reasonable, different assumptions or changes in general industry, market and macro-economic conditions could change the estimated fair values and, therefore, future impairment charges could be required, which could be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nRefer to Note 8, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the results of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing performed in fiscal 2024 and 2023.\nPension Plans\nThe Company provides a range of benefits, including pensions, to eligible active and former employees. Pension plan assets and obligations are measured annually, or more frequently if there is a significant remeasurement event, using various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, assumed rates of return and compensation increases as of that date. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.\nThe Company considers expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis when estimating discount rates. Different discount rates are used for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction and the expected timing of benefit payments. The Company uses country-specific discount rates determined by an independent third party which are based on government and high-quality corporate bond yields.\n45\nIn estimating the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers historical returns on plan assets, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, inflation assumptions, asset mix and the impact of the active management of the plans’ invested assets. For fiscal 2025, the Company believes the long-term rate of return will approximate 6.50% for U.S. pension plans and 5.44% for non-U.S. pension plans. Any differences between actual investment results and the expected long-term asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a significant remeasurement event. If actual returns on plan assets are less than the Company’s expectations, additional contributions may be required.\nBased on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable, however, changes in these assumptions could impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The following chart illustrates the estimated increases (decreases) in projected benefit obligation and future ongoing pension expense, excluding any potential mark-to-market adjustments, assuming an increase of 25 basis points in the key assumptions used for the Company's pension plans (in millions):\nLoss Contingencies\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, environmental matters, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. It is difficult to estimate the Company’s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved, the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties, the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted, the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment, the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites, and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur. It is possible that technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the results of additional environmental studies or other factors could change the Company's expectations with respect to future charges and cash outlays, and such changes could be material to the Company's future results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Nevertheless, the Company does not currently believe that any claims, penalties or costs in addition to the amounts accrued will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities. The determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience. The Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. The Company maintains captive insurance companies to manage its insurable liabilities.\nAsbestos-Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. The Company's estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the Company's historical claim experience, and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed and is discounted to present values from the time that the costs are expected to be incurred which in some cases is not until 2068 (which is the Company's reasonable best estimate of the actuarial determined time period through which asbestos-related claims will be filed against Company affiliates). Estimated asbestos-related defense costs are included in the asbestos liability. The Company's legal strategy for\n46\nresolving claims also impacts these estimates. The Company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time (the look-back period) over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made through 2068. At least annually, the Company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed, settled and dismissed, and amounts paid in settlements. In addition to claims and settlement experience, the Company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation, the legal environment, and the Company's defense strategy. The Company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on an annual basis. The Company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted.\nIn connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, the Company records asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are probable. The Company's estimate of asbestos-related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims discounted to present value. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, the Company considers available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers. Refer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on management's judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestos-related assets and liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents non-U.S. operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain. Management judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company’s valuation allowances may be necessary. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a valuation allowance of $6.3 billion for continuing operations, of which $5.9 billion relates to net operating and capital loss carryforwards primarily in France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, and the United Kingdom for which sustainable taxable income has not been demonstrated; and $0.4 billion for other deferred tax assets.\nThe Company’s federal income tax returns and certain non-U.S. income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the IRS and respective non-U.S. tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At September 30, 2024, the Company had recorded a liability of $2.1 billion\nfor its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions, the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nThe Company does not generally provide additional U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on outside basis differences of consolidated subsidiaries included in shareholders’ equity attributable to Johnson Controls International plc, except in limited circumstances including anticipated taxation on planned divestitures. The reduction of the outside basis differences via the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries and/or distributions could create taxable income. The Company’s intent is to reduce the outside basis differences only when it would be tax efficient. Refer to \"Capitalization\" within the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section for discussion of U.S. and non-U.S. cash projections.\nRefer to Note 18, \"Income Taxes,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the Company's income tax disclosures.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to the \"New Accounting Pronouncements\" section within Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\n47\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency, commodities, and interest rates. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures, which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes. At the inception of the hedge, the Company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as a hedge of either a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to an unrecognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge) or a net investment in a non-U.S. operation (a net investment hedge).\nThe Company performs hedge effectiveness testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used. All derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging,\" are revalued in the consolidated statements of income.\nFor all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test. The fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued, and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated. The hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80% and 125%. For commodity derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges, effectiveness is tested using a qualitative assessment of the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item. Ineffectiveness is minimal as the Company aligns most of the critical terms of its derivatives with the supply contracts.\nFor net investment hedges, the Company assesses its net investment positions in the non-U.S. operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a quarterly basis. The hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a non-U.S. operation does not exceed the Company’s net investment positions in the respective non-U.S. operation.\nDerivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 require no assessment of effectiveness.\nA discussion of the Company’s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements, and further disclosure relating to derivatives and hedging activities is included in Note 11, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,\" and Note 12, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Exchange\nThe Company has manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies. In order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the Company’s global diversification, foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are, as appropriate, hedged with financial instruments.\nThe Company hedges 70% to 90% of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures. The Company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables. Gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure, primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815.\nThe Company has entered into foreign currency denominated debt obligations to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries. The currency effects of debt obligations are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") account within shareholders’\nequity attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders where they offset gains and losses recorded on the Company’s net investm\nents globally.\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company estimates that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have decreased net unrealized gains by approximately $144 million and $63 million, respectively.\n48\nInterest Rates\nSubstantially all of the Company's outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, and, therefore, any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. A 100 basis point increase/decrease in the average interest rate on the Company's variable rate debt would have an immaterial impact on interest expense.\nCommodities\nThe Company uses commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts. Commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines. As a cash flow hedge, gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on purchases of the underlying commodities that will be used in the business. The maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities.\nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OTHER MATTERS\nThe Company’s global operations are governed by environmental laws and worker safety laws. Under various circumstances, these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines, as well as injunctive and remedial relief, for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where Company-related substances have been released into the environment.\nThe Company has expended substantial resources globally, both financial and managerial, to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance. However, the Company has been, and in the future may become, the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of Company-related substances released into the environment. Such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance, abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties. Historically, neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the Company have been material.\nRefer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n49\nQUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA\nThe following tables present selected quarterly financial data from continuing operations:"

    "text": "Index to Consolidated Financial Statements\n51\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson Controls International plc\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Johnson Controls International plc and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n52\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition from Certain Contracts with Customers\nAs described in Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized net sales of $22,952 million from continuing operations and $4,466 million from discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2024, of which a majority relates to certain over time and point in time contracts with customers. Revenue from certain long-term contracts to design, manufacture and install building products and systems as well as unscheduled repair or replacement services is recognized on an over time basis, with progress towards completion measured using a cost-to-cost input method based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. The cost-to-cost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs. Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and estimated losses are recorded when identified. The Company enters into extended warranties and long-term service and maintenance agreements with certain customers. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term. Revenue associated with the sale of equipment and related installations are generally recognized over time on a cost-to-cost input method, while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are rendered. In other cases, the Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when control over the goods or services transfers to the customer.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition from certain contracts with customers is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the revenue recognized on certain of the Company's over time and point in time contracts with customers.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process for the Company’s over time and point in time contracts with customers. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized for a sample of over time and point in time contracts with customers. Evaluating the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized for certain over time contracts with customers involved (i) obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts or service tickets, change orders, and evidence of progress towards completion or services delivered; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the over time revenue recognition methods; (iii) testing, on a sample basis for certain over time contracts, the costs incurred to date; and (iv) performing a comparison of estimated gross margin in the prior year to gross margin at completion of the arrangement in the current year for certain over time contracts with customers. Evaluating the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized for certain point in time contracts with customers involved (i) obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts or purchase orders, evidence of goods delivered, and consideration received in exchange for those goods and (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the point in time revenue recognition method.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nNovember 19, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1957.\n53\nJohnson Controls International plc\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n54\nJohnson Controls International plc\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements\n.\n55\nJohnson Controls International plc\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n56\nJohnson Controls International plc\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n57\nJohnson Controls International plc\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n58\nJohnson Controls International plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Johnson Controls International plc, a public limited  company organized under the laws of Ireland, and its subsidiaries (Johnson Controls International plc and all its subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Company,\" \"Johnson Controls\" or \"JCI plc\").\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on September 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.\nNature of Operations\nJohnson Controls International plc, headquartered in Cork, Ireland, is a global leader in smart, healthy and sustainable buildings, serving a wide range of customers in more than\n150\ncountries. The Company’s products, services, systems and solutions advance the safety, comfort and intelligence of spaces to serve people, places and the planet. The Company is committed to helping its customers win and creating greater value for all of its stakeholders through its strategic focus on buildings.\nThe Company is a global leader in engineering, manufacturing, commissioning and retrofitting building products and systems, including residential and commercial HVAC equipment, industrial refrigeration systems, controls, security systems, fire-detection systems and fire-suppression solutions. The Company further serves customers by providing technical services, including maintenance, management, repair, retrofit and replacement of equipment (in the HVAC, industrial refrigeration, security and fire-protection space), and energy-management consulting. The Company's OpenBlue digital software platform enables enterprises to better manage their physical spaces by combining the Company's building products and services with cutting-edge technology and digital capabilities to enable data-driven “smart building” services and solutions. The Company partners with customers by leveraging its broad product portfolio and digital capabilities powered by OpenBlue, together with its direct channel service and solutions capabilities, to deliver outcome-based solutions across the lifecycle of a building that address customers’ needs to improve energy efficiency, enhance security, create healthy environments and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nAs discussed in more detail in Note 3, \"Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\", the Company has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Residential and Light Commercial (“R&LC\") HVAC business, including the North America Ducted business and the global Residential joint venture with Hitachi Global Life Solutions, Inc. (“Hitachi”), of which Johnson Controls owns\n60\n% and Hitachi owns\n40\n%. The R&LC HVAC business, which was previously reported in the Global Products segment, meets the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and, as a result, its historical financial results are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation, and assets and liabilities were reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, all activities and amounts reported in the following footnotes relate to the continuing operations of the Company and exclude activities and amounts related to the R&LC HVAC business.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson Controls International plc and its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. Investments in partially-owned affiliates are accounted for by the equity method when the Company exercises significant influence, which typically occurs when its ownership interest exceeds\n20\n%, and the Company does not have a controlling interest.\nThe Company consolidates variable interest entities (\"VIE\") when it has the power to direct the significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that may be significant. The Company did not have any material consolidated or nonconsolidated VIEs in its continuing operations for the presented reporting periods.\n59\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement,\" defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability as follows:\nLevel 1:\nObservable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2:\nQuoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3:\nUnobservable inputs where there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAcquisitions\nThe purchase price of acquired businesses is allocated to the related identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. In addition, any contingent consideration is recorded at the estimated fair value as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price. This estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate, which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price, are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Payments for contingent earn-out liabilities that are less than or equal to estimates on the acquisition date are reflected as financing cash outflows. Amounts paid in excess of the estimated contingent earn-out liabilities on the acquisition date are reflected as operating cash outflows.\nAll available information is used to estimate fair values. External valuation specialists are typically engaged to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. The preliminary purchase price allocation is adjusted, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as more information is obtained regarding assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.\nThe purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires the Company to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The fair value of assets and liabilities is estimated based upon the carrying value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies.\nOther estimates used in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, future cash flows or income related to intangibles, market rate assumptions and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could differ materially.\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nAssets and liabilities (disposal groups) to be sold are classified as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met:\n•\nManagement, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group;\n60\n•\nThe disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups;\n•\nAn active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated;\n•\nSale of the disposal group is probable and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond the Company's control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year;\n•\nThe disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and\n•\nActions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nThe Company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, \"Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\" The carrying amount of any assets, including goodwill, that are part of the disposal group, but not in the scope of ASC 360-10, are tested for impairment under the relevant guidance prior to measuring the disposal group at fair value, less cost to sell.\nAny loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Gains on the sale of a disposal group are not recognized until the date of sale. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale.\nUpon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group, if material, in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash relates to amounts restricted for payment of asbestos liabilities and certain litigation and environmental matters and is recorded within other current assets in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nReceivables\nReceivables consist of billed receivables which are currently due from customers and unbilled receivables where the Company has satisfied its performance obligations, but has not yet issued the invoice to the customer. Incentives are periodically offered to customers, including early payment discounts and extended payment terms of certain receivables. The Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintains an allowance for expected credit losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments. The allowance for expected credit losses is based on historical experience, existing economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and any specific customer collection issues the Company has identified. The Company evaluates the reasonableness of the allowance for expected credit losses on a quarterly basis. The allowance for expected credit losses was $\n210\nmillion as of September 30, 2024 and $\n88\nmillion as of September 30, 2023.\nThe Company has previously entered into various factoring agreements to sell certain accounts receivable to third-party financial institutions. The Company collected the majority of the factored receivables on behalf of the financial institutions, but maintained no other continuing involvement with the factored receivables. Sales of accounts receivable were reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated statements of financial position and the proceeds were included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company discontinued its receivables factoring program in March 2024.\n61\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes. Estimated useful lives generally range from\n3\nto\n40\nyears for buildings and improvements, up to\n15\nyears for subscriber systems, and from\n3\nto\n15\nyears for machinery and equipment. Interest on borrowings is capitalized during the active construction period of major capital projects, added to the cost of the underlying assets and amortized over the useful lives of the assets.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter (as of July 31) or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The Company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units, which have been determined to be the Company’s operating segments or one level below the operating segments, using a qualitative assessment or a quantitative test. A qualitative assessment is performed when prior quantitative assessments have resulted in significant excess of fair value over the carrying value of a reporting unit, and consideration of qualitative factors allow the Company to conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit remains greater than its carrying value. When performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To estimate the fair value, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model or estimated sales price for reporting units held for sale. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement.\" The estimated fair value is then compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. The Company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are also subject to at least annual impairment testing in the fourth fiscal quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks and trade names and are tested for impairment using a relief-from-royalty method. The Company considers the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term. The Company considers the profitability of the business, among other factors, to determine the royalty rate for use in the impairment assessment.\nWhile the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodologies are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes.\nLeases\nLessee arrangements\nThe Company leases certain administrative, production and other facilities, fleet vehicles, information technology equipment and other equipment under arrangements that are accounted for as operating leases. The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at contract inception based on whether the arrangement involves the use of a physically distinct identified asset and whether the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period as well as the right to direct the use of the asset.\nRight-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. The majority of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit interest rate. To determine the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available on the lease commencement date or  the implicit rate if it is readily determinable. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on a comparable\n62\nmarket yield curve consistent with its credit rating, term of the lease and relative economic environment. The Company has elected to combine lease and nonlease components for its leases.\nMost leases contain options to renew or terminate the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities reflect only the options which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.\nThe Company has certain real estate leases that contain variable lease payments which are based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\"). Additionally, the Company's leases generally require it to pay for fuel, maintenance, repair, insurance and taxes. These payments are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability and are expensed as incurred.\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLessor arrangements\nThe Company has monitoring services and maintenance agreements within its security business that include subscriber system assets for which the Company retains ownership. These agreements contain both lease and nonlease components. The Company has elected to combine lease and nonlease components for these arrangements where the timing and pattern of transfer of the lease and nonlease components are the same and the lease component would be classified as an operating lease if accounted for separately. The Company has concluded that in these arrangements the nonlease components are the predominant characteristic, and as a result, the combined component is accounted for under the revenue guidance.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including right-of-use assets under operating leases, other tangible assets and intangible assets with definite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, \"Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,\" ASC 350-30, \"General Intangibles Other than Goodwill\" and ASC 985-20, \"Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed.\"\nAssets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluates the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset group is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals.\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities are considered indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During the period that those assets are considered indefinite lived, they are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess.\nUnamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product are compared to the net realizable value of the product. The amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product exceed the net realizable value of that asset is written off.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from certain long-term contracts to design, manufacture and install building products and systems as well as unscheduled repair or replacement services is recognized on an over time basis, with progress towards completion measured using a cost-to-cost input method based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. The cost-to-cost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs. Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed monthly. If contract modifications result in additional goods or services that are distinct from those transferred before the modification, they are accounted for prospectively as if the Company entered into a new contract. If the goods or services in the modification are not distinct from those in the original contract, sales and gross profit are adjusted using the cumulative catch-up method for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recorded when identified. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component because at contract inception it expects to receive the payment within twelve months of transfer of goods or services.\n63\nThe Company enters into extended warranties and long-term service and maintenance agreements with certain customers. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term.\nThe Company also sells certain HVAC and refrigeration products and services in bundled arrangements with multiple performance obligations, such as equipment, commissioning, service labor and extended warranties. Approximately\nfour\nto\ntwenty-four months\nseparate the timing of the first deliverable until the last piece of equipment is delivered. There may also be extended warranty arrangements with durations of\none\nto\nfive years\ncommencing upon the end of the standard warranty period. In addition, the Company sells security monitoring systems that may have multiple performance obligations, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. Revenue associated with the sale of equipment and related installations are generally recognized over time on a cost-to-cost input method, while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are rendered. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price method. In order to estimate relative standalone selling price, market data and transfer price studies are utilized. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach or expected cost plus margin approach. If the Company retains ownership of the subscriber system asset, fees for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis. Non-refundable fees received in connection with the initiation of a monitoring contract, along with associated direct and incremental selling costs, are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the contract.\nIn all other cases, the Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when control over the goods or services transfers to the customer.\nThe Company assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including discounts, rebates, refunds, credits or other similar sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. These estimates are based on the amount of consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to.\nShipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost of sales when control transfers to the customer. The Company presents amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes net of the related amounts remitted.\nSubscriber System Assets, Dealer Intangibles and Related Deferred Revenue Accounts\nThe Company considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories:\n•\nInternally generated residential subscriber systems outside of North America;\n•\nInternally generated commercial subscriber systems; and\n•\nCustomer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program, primarily outside of North America (referred to as dealer intangibles).\nSubscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which the Company retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets represent capitalized equipment (e.g., security control panels, touch pad, motion detectors, window sensors, and other equipment) and installation costs associated with electronic security monitoring arrangements under which the Company retains ownership of the security system assets in a customer's place of business or residence. Installation costs represent costs incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use. The Company pays property taxes on the subscriber system assets and may retrieve such assets when the agreement is terminated. These assets embody a probable future economic benefit as they generate future monitoring revenue for the Company.\nCosts related to the subscriber system equipment and installation are categorized as property, plant and equipment rather than deferred costs. Deferred costs associated with subscriber system assets represent direct and incremental selling expenses (such as commissions) related to acquiring the customer. Commissions related to up-front consideration paid by customers in connection with the establishment of the monitoring arrangement are determined based on a percentage of the up-front fees and do not exceed deferred revenue. Such deferred costs are recorded as other current and noncurrent assets within the consolidated statements of financial position.\n64\nSubscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas which have a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the same month and year of acquisition. Pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue are depreciated using a straight-line method with lives up to\n12\nyears and considering customer attrition. Non-pooled subscriber systems (primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia) and related deferred revenue are depreciated using a straight-line method with a\n15\n-year life, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination.\nCertain contracts and related customer relationships result from purchasing residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program, primarily outside of North America. Acquired contracts and related customer relationships are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price. During the first\n6\nmonths (\n12\nmonths in certain circumstances) after the purchase of the customer contract, any cancellation of monitoring service, including those that result from customer payment delinquencies, results in a chargeback by the Company to the dealer for the full amount of the contract purchase price. The Company records the amount charged back to the dealer as a reduction of the previously recorded intangible asset. Intangible assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the same month and year of contract acquisition on a straight-line basis over the period of the customer relationship. The estimated useful life of dealer intangibles ranges from\n12\nto\n15\nyears.\nResearch and Development Costs\nExpenditures for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged against income as incurred and primarily included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Such expenditures for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n267\nmillion, $\n251\nmillion and $\n236\nmillion, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nRestricted (Non-vested) Stock /Units\nRestricted stock and restricted stock units are typically settled in shares for employees in the U.S. and in cash for employees not in the U.S. Restricted awards typically vest over a period of\nthree years\nfrom the grant date. The Company's Compensation and Talent Development Committee may approve different vesting terms on specific grants. The fair value of each share-settled restricted award is based on the closing market value of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of grant. The fair value of each cash-settled restricted award is recalculated at the end of each reporting period based on the closing market value of the Company's ordinary shares at the end of the reporting period, and the liability and expense are adjusted based on the new fair value.\nPerformance Share Awards\nPerformance-based share unit (\"PSU\") awards are generally contingent on the achievement of predetermined performance goals over a performance period of\none\nto\nthree years\nand on the award holder's continuous employment until the vesting date. The majority of PSUs are also indexed to the achievement of specified levels of total shareholder return versus a peer group over the performance period.\nUpon completion of the performance period, earned PSUs are typically settled with shares of the Company's ordinary shares for employees in the U.S. and in cash for employees not in the U.S.\nThe fair value of the portion of the PSU which is linked to the achievement of performance goals is based on the closing market value of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense for these PSUs is recognized over the performance period based on the probability of achieving the performance targets.\nThe fair value of the portion of the PSU that is indexed to total shareholder return is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation that uses the following assumptions:\n•\nThe risk-free interest rate for periods during the contractual life of the PSU is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n65\n•\nThe expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock over the most recent three-year period as of the grant date.\nShare-based compensation expense for PSUs which are indexed to total shareholder return is not adjusted for changes in performance subsequent to the grant date because the likelihood of achieving the market condition is incorporated in the grant date fair value of the award.\nStock Options\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. Stock option awards typically vest between\ntwo\nand\nthree years\nafter the grant date and expire\nten years\nfrom the grant date.\nThe fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the following assumptions:\n•\nThe expected life of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.\n•\nThe risk-free interest rate for periods during the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n•\nFor grants in fiscal 2024 and 2023, expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock corresponding to the expected life as of the grant date. For grants in fiscal 2022, expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock since October 2016 and certain peer companies' stock prior to October 2016 over the most recent period corresponding to the expected life as of the grant date.\n•\nThe expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of the Company’s ordinary shares as of the grant date.\nThe Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Johnson Controls by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Johnson Controls by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the reporting period that are calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options, unvested restricted stock and unvested performance share awards. The treasury stock method assumes that the Company uses the proceeds from the exercise of stock option awards to repurchase ordinary shares at the average market price during the period. The assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the purchase price that the grantee will pay in the future and compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized. For unvested restricted stock and unvested performance share awards, assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include unamortized compensation cost.\nForeign Currency Translation\nSubstantially all of the Company’s international operations use the respective local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of international entities have been translated at period-end exchange rates, and income and expenses have been translated using average exchange rates for the period. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies are adjusted to reflect period-end exchange rates. Aggregate transaction gains (losses), net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, included in income from continuing operations for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $(\n10\n) million, $\n22\nmillion and $\n33\nmillion, respectively.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company has written policies and procedures that place all derivative financial instruments under the direction of Corporate treasury and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes. The use of derivatives for speculative purposes is strictly prohibited. The Company selectively uses derivatives to manage the market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates.\n66\nThe fair values of all derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position. The change in a derivative’s fair value is recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"), depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nInvestments\nInvestments in debt and equity securities and deferred compensation plan assets are marked to market at the end of each accounting period. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of income.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\nThe Company utilizes a mark-to-market approach for recognizing pension and postretirement benefit expenses, including measuring plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event.\nGuarantees\nThe Company records an estimate for future warranty-related costs based on actual historical claims and other known factors. Based on analysis of return rates and other factors, the Company’s warranty provisions are adjusted as necessary. The Company monitors its warranty activity and adjusts its reserve estimates when it is probable that future warranty costs will be different from those estimates.\nThe Company’s product warranty liability is recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position in other current liabilities if the warranty is less than\none year\nand in other noncurrent liabilities if the warranty extends longer than\none year\n.\nLoss Contingencies\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, environmental matters, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. Expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations are recognized when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nLiabilities and expenses for workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities are dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience. Receivables from third party insurers are recorded when recovery has been determined to be probable. The Company maintains captive insurance companies to manage its insurable liabilities.\nAsbestos-Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with numerous other companies, are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. The estimated liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs are based on the Company's historical claim experience, and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed and is discounted to present values from the time that the costs are expected to be incurred which in some cases is not until 2068 (which is the Company's reasonable best estimate of the actuarial determined time period through which asbestos-related claims will be filed against its affiliates). Estimated asbestos-related defense costs are included in the asbestos liability. The Company's legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates. The Company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time (the look-back period) over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made through 2068. At least annually, the Company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed, settled and dismissed, and amounts paid in settlements. In addition to claims and settlement experience, the Company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation, the legal environment, and its defense strategy. The Company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on an annual basis. The Company evaluates all of these factors and determines\n67\nwhether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted.\nThe Company records asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are probable. Estimated asbestos-related insurance recoveries represent estimated amounts due to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims discounted to present value. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, the Company considers available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax asset and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the book and tax basis of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss carryforwards, using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the carrying or book value of deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, including consideration of tax planning strategies, it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, \"Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,\" which is intended to enhance the transparency surrounding the use of supplier finance programs. Supplier finance programs may also be referred to as reverse factoring, payables finance, or structured payables arrangements. The amendments require a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the program’s key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period, and associated rollforward information. Only the amount outstanding at the end of the period must be disclosed in interim periods. The Company adopted the new disclosures, other than the rollforward disclosure, as required at the beginning of fiscal 2024. The rollforward disclosure will be adopted as required at the beginning of fiscal 2025.\nThe Company maintains agreements with third-party financial institutions who offer voluntary supply chain financing (\"SCF\") programs to its suppliers. The SCF programs enable suppliers to sell their receivables to third-party financial institutions and receive payments earlier than the negotiated commercial terms between the suppliers and the Company, which generally range from\n90\nto\n120\ndays. Suppliers sell receivables to third-party financial institutions on terms negotiated between the supplier and the respective third-party financial institution. The Company remains obligated to make payments under the terms of the original commercial arrangement regardless of whether the supplier receivable is sold, and does not pledge any assets as security or provide other forms of guarantees for the committed payment to the third-party financial institutions.\nAmounts outstanding related to SCF programs are included in\naccounts payable\nin the consolidated statements of financial position. Accounts payable included in the SCF programs were approximately $\n703\nmillion and $\n520\nmillion as of September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,\" which is intended to enhance transparency into the nature and function of expenses. The amendments require that on an annual and interim basis, entities disclose disaggregated operating expense information about specific categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and depletion.\nThe Company expects to adopt the new annual disclosures as required for fiscal 2028 and the interim disclosures as required beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2029.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,\" which is intended to enhance the transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments require that on an annual basis, entities disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amendments require that entities disclose additional information about income taxes paid as well as additional disclosures of pretax income and income tax expense, and remove the requirement to disclose certain\n68\nitems that are no longer considered cost beneficial or relevant.\nThe Company expects to adopt the new annual disclosures as required for fiscal 2026.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures,\" which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment and contain other disclosure requirements. The Company expects to adopt the new annual disclosures as required for fiscal 2025 and the interim disclosures as required beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\nOther recently issued accounting pronouncements are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n2.\nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nFiscal 2024\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company completed\nthree\ndivestitures, including the divestiture of its Air Distribution Technologies (\"ADTi\") business which was included within the Global Products segment. The combined selling price, net of cash divested, was $\n347\nmillion, of which $\n332\nmillion was received as of September 30, 2024. In connection with the closing of the ADTi transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $\n42\nmillion within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. An impairment of $\n56\nmillion was recorded within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income while the business was classified as held for sale. Net cash proceeds from the divestitures were used for general corporate purposes. The businesses did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations as the divestitures did not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results.\nFiscal 2023\nIn July 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of FM:Systems, a leading digital workplace management and Internet of Things (\"IoT\") solutions provider for facilities and real estate professionals, for $\n540\nmillion, net of cash acquired, which was comprised of an upfront cash payment of $\n465\nmillion, and the estimated fair value at the acquisition date of contingent earn-out liabilities which are primarily based upon the achievement of certain defined operating results in the\ntwo years\nfollowing the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition and subsequent measurement period adjustments, the Company recorded goodwill of $\n407\nmillion in the Building Solutions North America segment. Goodwill is attributable primarily to expected synergies, expanded market opportunities and other benefits that the Company believes will result from integrating the products and capabilities of FM:Systems into its operations. The goodwill created in the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company acquired several other businesses for a combined purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $\n306\nmillion, of which $\n260\nmillion was paid as of September 30, 2023. Intangible assets associated with these acquisitions totaled $\n116\nmillion and primarily relate to customer relationships and technology. The Company recorded goodwill associated with these acquisitions of $\n119\nmillion in the Global Products segment, $\n55\nmillion in the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment and $\n13\nmillion in the Building Solutions EMEA/LA segment.\n3.\nASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nIn July 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its R&LC HVAC business, which includes the North America Ducted businesses and the global Residential joint venture with Hitachi, of which Johnson Controls owns\n60\n% and Hitachi owns\n40\n%, to Bosch Group for approximately $\n8.1\nbillion in cash with the Company’s portion of the aggregate consideration being approximately $\n6.7\nbillion, inclusive of an upfront royalty payment for the licensing of the York tradename. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, subject to required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The R&LC HVAC business, which was previously reported in the Global Products segment, meets the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations as it represents a strategic shift in the Company's operations and results in the exit of substantially all of its residential and light commercial HVAC businesses. As a result, results of the business are presented in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n69\nThe Company determined that the assets and liabilities for the R&LC HVAC business met the held for sale criteria during the fourth quarter of 2024. Accordingly, the businesses' assets and liabilities were reclassified in the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023 to held for sale, and the Company ceased recording depreciation and amortization for the held for sale assets.\nThe following table summarizes the results of the R&LC HVAC business which are reported as discontinued operations (in millions):\n70\nThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities of the R&LC HVAC business which were classified as held for sale (in millions):\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are required to be recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value less costs to sell of the held for sale businesses exceeded their carrying value, and therefore, no adjustment was necessary.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges for the Global Retail business of $\n438\nmillion and the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment of $\n60\nmillion. The impairment charges were primarily due to reductions in the estimated fair values of the businesses to be disposed as a result of negotiations with potential buyers and were recorded within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company concluded that its Global Retail business no longer met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, as it was no longer probable that it would be sold in the next 12 months. The net assets were reclassified to held and used at the lower of fair value or adjusted carrying value, and due to prior period impairment charges recorded, there was no impact to the consolidated statements of income as a result of this reclassification.\n71\n4.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nDisaggregated Revenue\nThe following table presents the Company's revenues disaggregated by segment and by products and systems versus services revenue (in millions):\nThe following table presents further disaggregation of Global Products revenues by product type (in millions):\nContract Balances\nContract assets represent the Company’s right to consideration for performance obligations that have been satisfied but not billed and consist of unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings. Contract liabilities are customer payments received before performance obligations are satisfied. Contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nThe following table presents the location and amount of contract balances in the Company's consolidated statements of financial position (in millions):\nThe Company recognized revenue that was included in the beginning of period contract liability balance of approximately $\n1.7\nbillion\nand $\n1.5\nbillion for the\nyears ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a distinct good, service, or bundle of goods and services promised in a contract. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When contracts with customers require significant and complex integration, contain goods or services which are highly interdependent or interrelated, or are goods or services which significantly modify or customize other promises in the contracts and, therefore, are not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, the contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation.\n72\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $\n21.1\nbillion, of which approximately\n64\n% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next\ntwo years\n. The remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized in revenue beyond\ntwo years\nprimarily relate to large, multi-purpose contracts to construct hospitals, schools and other governmental buildings, which include services to be performed over the building's lifetime,\nwith average initial contract terms of\n25\nto\n35\nyears. Future contract modifications could affect both the timing and the amount of the remaining performance obligations. The Company excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for service contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts that are cancellable without substantial penalty.\nCosts to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract\nThe Company recognizes the incremental costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer as an asset when the costs are recoverable. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions and bid/proposal costs. Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are capitalized when incurred and amortized to expense over the period of contract performance.\nThe following table presents the location and amount of costs to obtain or fulfill a contract recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of financial position (in millions):\nAmortization of costs to obtain or fulfill a contract was $\n312\nmillion and $\n251\nmillion during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were\nno\nimpairment losses recognized in the year ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\n5.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nThe Company discontinued its receivable factoring program in March 2024. The Company sold $\n641\nmillion and $\n1,717\nmillion of accounts receivable under factoring agreements during the years ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The cost of factoring such receivables was not material. Previously sold receivables still outstanding were $\n16\nmillion and $\n615\nmillion as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n6.\nINVENTORIES\nInventories consisted of the following (in millions):\n73\n7.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty, plant and equipment consisted of the following (in millions):\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred in the asset group comprising the security subscriber business of Argentina, primarily as a result of the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso that occurred during the quarter and the resulting impact on operating results and cash flows. The Company conducted the two-step impairment test required in accordance with ASC 360, \"Property, Plant & Equipment\" and determined that the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its fair value. A non-cash impairment charge to the subscriber system assets of $\n78\nmillion was recorded and is included in restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income. The Company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the asset group. The primary assumptions and inputs used in the model included management's internal projections of future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. The fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement\" due to the unobservable inputs used.\n8.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill in each of the Company’s reportable segments were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nIncludes measurement period adjustments and the allocation of $\n21\nmillion of goodwill from Global Products to the ADTi disposal group classified as held for sale in June 2024 and subsequently divested in July 2024. Refer to Note 2, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n74\nManagement completed its fiscal 2024 annual impairment test as of July 31, which included a qualitative assessment of all but\none\nof its reporting units. The Company did not identify any qualitative factors that suggest that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying amount, including goodwill, and as such, a quantitative impairment test was not necessary. The Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test of\none\nreporting unit with $\n214\nmillion of goodwill, and its fair value was in excess of its carrying value. However, for this reporting unit, a\n200\nbasis point increase in the discount rate, or a\n200\nbasis point decrease in the revenue growth rates, would cause the fair value to be less than the carrying value. While\nno\nimpairment was recorded, it is possible that future changes in circumstances could result in a non-cash impairment charge.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company determined a triggering event had occurred for\none\nof its reporting units in the Business Solutions EMEA/LA segment due to year-to-date results and projections for the remainder of fiscal 2024 being lower than the forecast used in the previous annual goodwill impairment test, and a quantitative test of goodwill for possible impairment was necessary. As a result of the goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n230\nmillion within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income, which was determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its fair value. The Company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The primary assumptions used in the model were management's internal projections of future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate, which are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement.\"\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, management completed an updated comprehensive review of the Silent-Aire reporting\nunit, which is included in the Global Products segment. Because actual results were lower than planned and the nearer term forecast was revised to reflect lower margins and earnings, the Company determined a triggering event had occurred and a quantitative test of goodwill for possible impairment was necessary. As a result of the goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n184\nmillion within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2023, which was determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its fair value. During its fiscal 2022 annual impairment test, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n75\nmillion of Silent Aire goodwill within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income. The Company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the Silent-Aire reporting unit in both fiscal 2023 and 2022. The primary assumptions and inputs used in the model included management's internal projections of future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. The fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement\" due to the unobservable inputs used. The Silent-Aire reporting unit had\nno\nremaining goodwill balance as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of goodwill impairment for its North America Retail reporting unit in conjunction with classifying its Global Retail business as held for sale. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n235\nmillion within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2022. The North America Retail reporting unit had\nno\nremaining goodwill balance as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company used the market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the relative estimated sales proceeds for the planned disposal of the Global Retail business attributable to the North America Retail reporting unit. The inputs utilized in the analysis are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement.\"\n75\nThere were no other triggering events requiring that an impairment assessment be conducted in fiscal 2024, 2023 or 2022. However, it is possible that future changes in circumstances would require the Company to record additional non-cash impairment charges.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe Company’s other intangible assets, primarily from business acquisitions, consisted of (in millions):\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company impaired $\n32\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion of miscellaneous intangible assets in the Global Products segment and Building Solutions North America segment, respectively. These non-cash charges were recorded within\nrestructuring and impairment costs\nin the consolidated statement of income.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company impaired $\n18\nmillion of miscellaneous intangible assets in the Global Products segment and $\n10\nmillion of a trademark in the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment. These non-cash charges were recorded within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nThere were no impairments of other indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of these years, other than as disclosed above. For all other remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company estimated fair values were greater than the carrying values, with the exception of two other registered trademarks in which the estimated fair values were consistent with their carrying values which totaled $\n335\nmillion as of July 31, 2024.\nAmortization of other intangible assets included within continuing operations for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n476\nmillion, $\n426\nmillion and $\n413\nmillion, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes estimated amortization of existing definite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2024 for each of the next five fiscal years (in millions):\n76\n9.\nLEASES\nThe following table presents the Company’s lease costs (in millions):\nThe following table presents supplemental consolidated statement of financial position information (in millions):\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information related to operating leases (in millions):\nThe following table presents future minimum rental payments for operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 (in millions):\n77\n10.\nDEBT AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nShort-Term Debt\nShort-term debt consisted of the following (in millions):\n78\nLong-Term Debt\nLong-term debt consisted of the following (in millions; due dates by fiscal year):\n1\nTIFSA = Tyco International Finance S.A.\n2\nTFSCA = Tyco Fire & Security Finance S.C.A.\n79\nThe following table presents maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 (in millions):\nOther\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had syndicated committed revolving credit facilities of $\n2.5\nbillion which is scheduled to expire in December 2028 and $\n500\nmillion which is scheduled to expire in December 2024. There were\nno\ndraws on the facilities as of September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants set forth in its credit agreements and the indentures governing its outstanding notes, and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\nTotal interest paid on both short and long-term debt for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n361\nmillion, $\n288\nmillion and $\n222\nmillion, respectively.\n11.\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nUnless otherwise noted, all activities and amounts reported in this footnote include both continuing operations of the Company and activities and amounts related to the R&LC HVAC business. See Note 3, \"Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\" for additional details regarding divestiture of the R&LC HVAC business.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company has global operations and participates in foreign exchange markets to minimize its risk of loss from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange rate risk primarily using foreign currency exchange forward contracts. The Company hedges\n70\n% to\n90\n% of the notional amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures.\nThe Company selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to commodity price risk, primarily using commodity hedge contracts, to minimize overall price risk associated with its purchases of copper and aluminum in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts. Commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines. The maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities.\nAs cash flow hedges under ASC 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging,\" the hedge gains or losses due to changes in fair value are initially recorded as a component of AOCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings. These contracts were highly effective in hedging the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company had the following outstanding contracts to hedge forecasted commodity purchases (in metric tons):\nThe Company may enter into forward-starting interest rate swaps in conjunction with anticipated note issuances. The forward-starting interest swaps are terminated when the anticipated notes are issued.\n80\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company terminated $\n600\nmillion of forward-starting interest rate swaps related to an anticipated note issuance that was no longer highly likely to occur. Accumulated amounts previously recorded in AOCI were not material and were recognized as net financing charges in the consolidated statements of income when the swaps were terminated.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company terminated forward-starting interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of €\n400\nmillion when the related anticipated debt was issued. Accumulated amounts recorded in AOCI as of the date of the debt issuance are amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective debt to reflect the difference between the swap's reference rate and the fixed rate of the note.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company may enter into cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency denominated debt obligations to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries. The currency effects of the cross-currency interest rate swaps and debt obligations are reflected in the AOCI account within shareholders’equity attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders where they offset gains and losses recorded on the Company’s net investments globally.\nThe following table summarizes net investment hedges (in billions):\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe Company holds certain foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 to hedge foreign currency exposure resulting from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. The changes in fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of income where they offset foreign currency transactional gains and losses on the nonfunctional currency denominated assets and liabilities being hedged.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nThe following table presents the location and fair values of derivative instruments and hedging activities included in the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position (in millions):\n81\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nThe use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk. The Company has established policies and procedures to limit the potential for counterparty credit risk, including establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. As a matter of practice, the Company deals with major banks worldwide having strong investment grade long-term credit ratings. To further reduce the risk of loss, the Company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\"ISDA\") master netting agreements with substantially all of its counterparties. The Company enters into ISDA master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under the derivative contracts. The master netting agreements generally provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event. The Company has not elected to offset the fair value positions of the derivative contracts recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nThe Company's derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features and do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the Company or the counterparties. The Company's exposure to credit risk associated with its derivative instruments is measured on an individual counterparty basis, as well as by groups of counterparties that share similar attributes. The Company does not anticipate any non-performance by any of its counterparties, and the concentration of risk with financial institutions does not present significant credit risk to the Company.\nThe gross and net amounts of\nderivative assets\nand\nliabilities\nwere as follows (in millions):\nDerivatives Impact on the Statements of Income and Statements of Comprehensive Income\nThe following table presents the pre-tax gains (losses) recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) related to cash flow hedges (in millions):\nThe following table presents the location and amount of the pre-tax gains (losses) on cash flow hedges reclassified from AOCI into the Company’s consolidated statements of income (in millions):\n82\nThe following table presents the location and amount of pre-tax gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income (in millions):\nThe following table presents pre-tax gains (losses) on net investment hedges recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments (\"CTA\") within other comprehensive income (loss) (in millions):\nNo\ngains or losses were reclassified from CTA into income for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n12.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following tables present the Company’s fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value (in millions):\n1\nClassified as restricted investments for payment of asbestos liabilities. Refer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details.\n83\n1\nClassified as restricted investments for payment of asbestos liabilities. Refer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in contingent earn-out liabilities, which are valued using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nValuation Methods\nCommodity derivatives\n: The commodity derivatives are valued under a market approach using publicized prices, where available, or dealer quotes.\nContingent earn-out liabilities\n: The contingent earn-out liabilities are generally established using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the forecasted operating results and the earn-out formulas specified in the purchase agreements.\nCross-currency interest rate swaps:\nThe fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps represents the difference between the swap's reference rate and exchange rate and the interest and exchange rates for a similar instrument as of the reporting period. Cross-currency interest rate swaps are valued under a market approach using publicized prices.\nDeferred compensation plan assets\n: Assets held in the deferred compensation plans will be used to pay benefits under certain of the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The investments primarily consist of mutual funds which are publicly traded on stock exchanges and are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices. Unrealized gains (losses) on the deferred compensation plan assets are recognized in the consolidated statements of income where they offset unrealized gains and losses on the related deferred compensation plan liability.\n84\nExchange traded funds\n: Investments in exchange traded funds are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices, where available, or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments. Refer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.\nForeign currency exchange derivatives\n: The foreign currency exchange derivatives are valued under a market approach using publicized spot and forward prices.\nInterest rate swaps:\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps represents the difference between the swap's reference rate and the interest rate for a similar instrument as of the reporting period. Interest rate swaps are valued under a market approach using publicized prices.\nThe following table presents the portion of unrealized gains recognized in the consolidated statements of income that relate to equity securities still held at September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term debt and accounts payable approximate their carrying values.\nThe fair value of long-term debt was as follows (in billions):\nThe fair value of public debt was determined primarily using market quotes which are classified as Level 1 inputs within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy. The fair value of other long-term debt was determined using quoted market prices for similar instruments and are classified as Level 2 inputs within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy.\n13.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nUnless otherwise noted, all activities and amounts reported in this footnote include both continuing operations of the Company and activities and amounts related to the R&LC HVAC business. See Note 3, \"Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\" for additional details regarding divestiture of the R&LC HVAC business.\nThe Johnson Controls International plc 2021 Equity and Incentive Plan authorizes stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted (non-vested) stock/units, performance shares, performance units and other stock-based awards. The Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the Company's Board of Directors determines the types of awards to be granted to individual participants and the terms and conditions of the awards. Annual awards are typically granted in the first quarter of the fiscal year. As of September 30, 2024, there were\n55\nmillion shares of the Company's common stock reserved and\n36\nmillion shares available for issuance under the 2021 Equity and Incentive Plan.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation related charges and benefits (in millions):\n85\nCompensation expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company does not settle stock options granted under share-based payment arrangements in cash.\nRestricted (Non-vested) Stock / Units\nA summary of non-vested restricted stock awards at September 30, 2024, and changes for the year then ended, is presented below:\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $\n120\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock arrangements granted which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.8\nyears.\nPerformance Share Awards (PSU's)\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used in determining the fair value of performance share awards granted:\nA summary of the status of the Company’s non-vested PSU's at September 30, 2024, and changes for the year then ended, is presented below:\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $\n27\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance-based share unit awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.8\nyears.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted:\n86\nA summary of stock option activity at September 30, 2024, and changes for the year then ended, is presented below:\nThe following table summarizes additional stock option information:\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $\n9\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.6\nyears.\n14.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions):\n15.\nEQUITY\nDividends\nThe authority to declare and pay dividends is vested in the Board of Directors. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's ordinary shares is determined by the Company's Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, the capital requirements of the Company's businesses, industry practice and any other relevant factors.\n87\nUnder Irish law, dividends may only be paid (and share repurchases and redemptions must generally be funded) out of \"distributable reserves.\" The creation of distributable reserves was accomplished by way of a capital reduction, which the Irish High Court approved on December 18, 2014 and as acquired in conjunction with the Merger.\nShare Repurchase Program\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately $\n1.7\nbillion remained available under the share repurchase program which was approved by the Company's Board of Directors in March 2021. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe following table includes changes attributable to both continuing and discontinued operations in AOCI attributable to Johnson Controls (in millions, net of tax):\n(1)\nRefer to Note 11, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the line items in the consolidated statements of income affected by reclassifications from AOCI into income related to derivatives.\n16.\nRETIREMENT PLANS\nUnless otherwise noted, all activities and amounts reported in this footnote include both continuing operations of the Company and activities and amounts related to the R&LC HVAC business. See Note 3, \"Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\" for additional details regarding divestiture of the R&LC HVAC business.\nPension Benefits\nThe Company has non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The benefits provided are primarily based on years of service and average compensation or a monthly retirement benefit amount. The Company’s U.S. pension plans no longer allow new participants to enter the plans and no longer accrue benefits. Funding for U.S. pension plans equals or exceeds the minimum requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n88\nFunding for non-U.S. plans observes the local legal and regulatory limits. Also, the Company makes contributions to union-trusteed pension funds for construction and service personnel.\nThe following table includes information for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations (\"ABO\") in excess of plan assets (in millions):\nThe following table includes information for pension plans with projected benefit obligations (\"PBO\") in excess of plan assets (in millions):\nThe Company contributed $\n25\nmillion to the defined benefit plans in fiscal 2024 and expects to contribute approximately $\n23\nmillion in cash in fiscal 2025.\nNone\nof contributions made by the Company were voluntary.\nProjected benefit payments from the plans as of September 30, 2024 are estimated as follows (in millions):\nPostretirement Benefits\nThe Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and their dependents primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Most non-U.S. employees are covered by government sponsored programs. The cost to the Company is not significant.\nEligibility for coverage is based on meeting certain years of service and retirement age qualifications. These benefits may be subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations. The Company has reserved the right to modify these benefits.\nThe health care cost trend assumption does not have a significant effect on the amounts reported.\nThe following table includes information for postretirement plans with accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (\"APBO\") in excess of plan assets (in millions):\nThe Company contributed $\n2\nmillion to the postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2024 and expects to contribute approximately $\n2\nmillion in cash in fiscal 2025.\n89\nProjected benefit payments from the plans as of September 30, 2024 are estimated as follows (in millions):\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company sponsors various defined contribution savings plans that allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with plan specified guidelines. Under specified conditions, the Company will contribute to certain savings plans based on predetermined percentages of compensation earned by the employee and/or will match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. Defined contribution plan contributions charged to expense amounted to $\n208\nmillion, $\n209\nmillion and $\n196\nmillion during the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans\nThe Company contributes to multiemployer benefit plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements related to certain of its hourly employees in the U.S. These plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans.\nThe risks of participating in these multiemployer benefit plans are different from single-employer benefit plans in the following aspects:\n•\nAssets contributed to the multiemployer benefit plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\n•\nIf a participating employer stops contributing to the multiemployer benefit plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\n•\nIf the Company stops participating in some of its multiemployer benefit plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on its allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nThe Company participates in approximately\n240\nmultiemployer benefit plans, none of which are individually significant to the Company. The number of employees covered by the Company’s multiemployer benefit plans has remained consistent over the past three years, and there have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 contributions. The Company recognizes expense for the contractually-required contribution for each period. The Company contributed $\n80\nmillion, $\n67\nmillion and $\n71\nmillion to multiemployer benefit plans during the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nBased on the most recent information available, the Company believes that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in certain of these multiemployer benefit plans may exceed the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. Currently, the Company is not aware of any significant multiemployer benefit plans for which it is probable or reasonably possible that the Company will be obligated to make up any shortfall in funds. Moreover, if the Company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds, the Company could trigger a withdrawal liability. Currently, the Company is not aware of any multiemployer benefit plans for which it is probable or reasonably possible that the Company will have a significant withdrawal liability. Any accrual for a shortfall or withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and it can be reasonably estimated.\n90\nPlan Assets\nThe Company’s investment policies employ an approach whereby a mix of equities, fixed income and alternative investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. The investment portfolio primarily contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments. Equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value and small to large capitalization. Fixed income investments include corporate and government issues, with short-, mid- and long-term maturities, with a focus on investment grade when purchased and a target duration close to that of the plan liability. Investment and market risks are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through regular investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability studies. The majority of the real estate component of the portfolio is invested in a diversified portfolio of high-quality, operating properties with cash yields greater than the targeted appreciation. Investments in other alternative asset classes, including hedge funds, diversify the expected investment returns relative to the equity and fixed income investments. As a result of the Company's diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.\nThe Company’s actual asset allocations are in line with target allocations. The Company rebalances asset allocations as appropriate, in order to stay within a range of allocation for each asset category.\nThe expected return on plan assets is based on the Company’s expectation of the long-term average rate of return of the capital markets in which the plans invest. The average market returns are adjusted, where appropriate, for active asset management returns. The expected return reflects the investment policy target asset mix and considers the historical returns earned for each asset category.\n91\nThe Company’s plan assets at September 30, 2024 and 2023, by asset category, are as follows (in millions):\n92\n(1)\nThe fair value of certain real estate, multi-credit strategy, and alternative investments do not have a readily determinable fair value and require the fund managers to independently arrive at fair value by calculating net asset value (\"NAV\") per share. In order to calculate NAV per share, the fund managers value the investments using any one, or a combination of, the following methods: independent third party appraisals, discounted cash flow analysis of net cash flows projected to be generated by the investment and recent sales of comparable investments. Assumptions used to revalue the investments are updated every quarter.\n93\nDue to the fact that the fund managers calculate NAV per share, the Company utilizes a practical expedient for measuring the fair value of its real estate, multi-credit strategy, and alternative investments, as provided for under ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement.\" In applying the practical expedient, the Company is not required to further adjust the NAV provided by the fund manager in order to determine the fair value of its investments as the NAV per share is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of ASC 946, \"Financial Services - Investment Companies,\" and as of the Company's measurement date. The Company believes this is an appropriate methodology to obtain the fair value of these assets. The fair value amounts presented in these tables are intended to permit reconciliation of total plan assets to the amounts presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. Certain assets are held within commingled funds which are valued at the unitized NAV or percentage of the net asset value as determined by the manager of the fund. These values are based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the fund.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents is valued at cost.\nEquity Securities:\nThe fair value of equity securities is determined by direct quoted market prices. The underlying holdings are direct quoted market prices on regulated financial exchanges.\nFixed Income Securities:\nThe fair value of fixed income securities is determined by direct or indirect quoted market prices. If indirect quoted market prices are utilized, the value of assets held in separate accounts is not published, but the investment managers report daily the underlying holdings. The underlying holdings are direct quoted market prices on regulated financial exchanges.\nHedge Funds:\nThe fair value of hedge funds is accounted for by the custodian. The custodian obtains valuations from underlying managers based on market quotes for the most liquid assets and alternative methods for assets that do not have sufficient trading activity to derive prices. The Company and custodian review the methods used by the underlying managers to value the assets. The Company believes this is an appropriate methodology to obtain the fair value of these assets.\nReal Estate:\nThe fair value of real estate is determined by quoted market prices of the underlying Real Estate Investment Trusts\n(\"REITs\"), which are securities traded on an open exchange.\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\n94\nFunded Status\nThe following table contains the ABO and reconciliations of the changes in the PBO, the changes in plan assets and the funded status (in millions):\n(1)\nPlan assets and obligations are determined based on a September 30 measurement date at September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n(2)\nThe Company considers the expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis when setting assumed discount rates. As a result, the Company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction, the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For the U.S. pension and postretirement plans, the Company uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds. For the non-U.S. pension and postretirement plans, the Company consistently uses the relevant country specific benchmark indices for\n95\ndetermining the various discount rates. The Company has elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for pension and other postretirement for plans that utilize a yield curve approach. The full yield curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\nThe fiscal 2024 net actuarial losses related to changes in the projected benefit obligation were primarily the result of the decrease in discount rates globally. The fiscal 2023 net actuarial gains related to changes in the projected benefit obligation were primarily the result of the increase in discount rates globally.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nThe following table contains the components of net periodic benefit costs, which are recorded in\nselling, general and administrative expenses\nor cost of sales consistent with the related employees' salaries in the consolidated statements of income (in millions):\n17.\nRESTRUCTURING AND RELATED COSTS\nTo better align its resources with its growth strategies and reduce the cost structure of its global operations in certain underlying markets, the Company commits to restructuring plans as necessary. Restructuring activities generally result in charges for workforce reductions, plant closures, asset impairments and other related costs which are reported as restructuring and impairment costs in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The Company expects the restructuring actions to reduce cost of sales and SG&A due to reduced employee-related costs, depreciation and amortization expense.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company completed its previous restructuring plan and committed to a new multi-year restructuring plan to address stranded costs and further right-size its global operations as a result of previously announced portfolio simplification actions. It is expected that one-time restructuring costs, including severance and other employee termination benefits, contract termination costs, and certain other related cash and non-cash charges, of approximately $\n400\nmillion will be incurred over the course of fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027. Restructuring costs will be incurred across all segments and Corporate functions.\n96\nThe following table summarizes restructuring and related costs (in millions):\nThe following table summarizes changes in the restructuring reserve, which is included within other current liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position (in millions):\n18.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe components of the Company’s income tax provision from continuing operations are as follows (in millions):\nFor fiscal 2024, the effective tax rate for continuing operations was\n7\n%\nand was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to tax reserve adjustments as the result of tax audit resolutions and expired statute of limitations for certain tax years, valuation allowance adjustments and the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives, partially offset by the establishment of a deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference of the Company’s investment in certain subsidiaries as a result of the planned divestiture of its R&LC HVAC business and the unfavorable impact of impairment and restructuring charges.\nFor fiscal 2023, the effective tax rate for continuing operations was (\n42\n)% and was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the favorable tax impacts of intellectual property tax adjustments, tax reserve adjustments as the result of tax audit\n97\nresolutions and remeasurements, valuation allowance adjustments and the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of impairment and restructuring charges.\nFor fiscal 2022, the effective tax rate for continuing operations was (\n16\n)% and was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to favorable impact of tax reserve adjustments as the result of expired statute of limitations for certain tax years and the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of impairment and restructuring charges and the establishment of a deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference of the Company's investment in certain subsidiaries as a result of the planned divestitures.\nValuation Allowances\nThe Company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company’s valuation allowances may be necessary.\nIn fiscal 2024, due to changes in forecasted taxable income, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets of Mexico and Germany would be realized. The valuation allowance adjustment resulted in a tax benefit of $\n48\nmillion\n.\nIn fiscal 2023, due to changes in forecasted taxable income, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets of Canada, Mexico, and Spain would be realized. The valuation allowance adjustment resulted in a tax benefit of $\n121\nmillion.\nThe following table summarizes changes in the valuation allowance (in millions):\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\n98\nThe following table summarizes tax effected unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate and the related accrued interest, net of tax benefit (in millions):\nIn fiscal 2024, as the result of tax audit resolutions and statute expirations in various jurisdictions, the Company adjusted its reserve for uncertain tax positions which resulted in a $\n91\nmillion net benefit to income tax expense.\nIn fiscal 2023, as the result of tax audit resolutions, statute expirations, and remeasurements of ongoing controversy matters in various jurisdictions, the Company adjusted its reserve for uncertain tax positions which resulted in\na $\n438\nmillion net benefit to income tax expense.\nIn fiscal 2022, the statute of limitations for certain tax years expired, which resulted in a $\n301\nmillion benefit to income tax expense.\nIn the U.S., fiscal years 2019 through 2020 are currently under audit and fiscal years 2017 through 2018 are currently under appeal with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for certain legal entities. In addition, fiscal years 2016 through 2019 are also under exam by the IRS in relation to a separate consolidated filing group. Additionally, the Company is currently under exam in the following major non-U.S. jurisdictions for continuing operations:\nIt is reasonably possible that certain tax examinations and/or tax litigation will conclude within the next twelve months, which could have a material impact on tax expense. Based upon the circumstances surrounding these examinations, the impact is not currently quantifiable.\nOther Tax Matters\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred charges for restructuring and impairment costs of $\n510\nmillion, $\n1,049\nmillion and $\n701\nmillion, which generated tax benefits of $\n26\nmillion, $\n120\nmillion and $\n47\nmillion, respectively.\nImpacts of Tax Legislation and Change in Statutory Tax Rates\nOn December 18, 2023, the president of Ireland signed into law the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2023, which included legislation regarding the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. The Pillar Two legislation is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning October 1, 2024.\nOn September 11, 2023, the Schaffhausen parliament approved a partial revision of the cantonal act on direct taxation: Immediate Minimum Taxation Measure (“IMTM”). On November 19, 2023, IMTM was approved in a public referendum in the canton of Schaffhausen, was published in the cantonal official gazette on December 8, 2023, and was effective starting January 1, 2024. The IMTM increased Switzerland's combined statutory income tax rate to approximately\n15\n%. As a result, in fiscal 2024, the Company recorded a noncash discrete net tax benefit of $\n80\nmillion due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Switzerland and the canton of Schaffhausen.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) which, among other things, created a new book minimum tax of at least 15% of consolidated GAAP pre-tax income for corporations with average book income in excess of $1 billion. The book minimum tax was first applicable in fiscal 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate.\n99\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, other tax legislation was adopted in various jurisdictions. These law changes did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nSelected Income Tax Data\nSelected income tax data related to continuing operations were as follows (in millions):\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded within the consolidated statements of financial position in other current assets approximately $\n100\nmillion and $\n65\nmillion, respectively, of income tax assets. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded within the consolidated statements of financial position in other current liabilities approximately $\n211\nmillion and $\n249\nmillion, respectively, of accrued income tax liabilities.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company has not provided U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on approximately $\n24.5\nbillion of outside basis differences of consolidated subsidiaries of Johnson Controls International plc. The Company is indefinitely reinvested in these basis differences. The reduction of the outside basis differences via the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries and/or distributions could create taxable income. The Company's intent is to reduce the outside basis differences only when it would be tax efficient. Given the numerous ways in which the basis differences may be reduced, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized withholding taxes and deferred tax liability on the outside basis differences.\nDeferred taxes were classified in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows (in millions):\n100\nTemporary differences and carryforwards which gave rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities included (in millions):\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n22.1\nbillion, of which $\n11.8\nbillion will expire at various dates between 2025 and 2044, and the remainder has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company had available U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards at September 30, 2024 of $\n35\nmillion which will expire in 2029. The valuation allowance, generally, is for loss and credit carryforwards for which realization is uncertain because it is unlikely that the losses and/or credits will be realized given the lack of sustained profitability and/or limited carryforward periods in certain countries.\n19.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nASC 280, \"Segment Reporting,\" establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, the Company has determined that it has\nfour\nreportable segments for financial reporting purposes.\nThe Company conducts its business through\nfour\nbusiness segments:\n•\nBuilding Solutions North America\nwhich operates in the United States and Canada;\n•\nBuilding Solutions EMEA/LA\nwhich operates in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America;\n•\nBuilding Solutions Asia Pacific\nwhich operates in Asia Pacific; and\n•\nGlobal Products\nwhich operates worldwide.\nThe Building Solutions segments:\n•\nDesign, sell, install and service HVAC, controls, building management, refrigeration, integrated electronic security and integrated fire-detection and suppression systems; and\n•\nProvide energy-efficiency solutions and technical services, including data-driven \"smart building\" solutions as well as inspection, scheduled maintenance, and repair and replacement of mechanical and controls systems.\nThe Global Products segment designs, manufactures and sells:\n•\nHVAC equipment, controls software and software services;\n•\nRefrigeration equipment and controls;\n•\nFire protection and suppression; and\n101\n•\nSecurity products, including intrusion security, anti-theft devices, access control, and video surveillance and management systems.\nThe Company’s segments provide products and services primarily to commercial, institutional, industrial, data center, and governmental customers.\nManagement evaluates the performance of its segments primarily on segment earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (\"EBITA\"), which represents income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding  amortization of intangible assets, corporate expenses, restructuring and impairment costs, the water systems AFFF settlement costs and AFFF insurance recoveries, net financing charges, loss on divestiture and net mark-to-market gains and losses related to pension and postretirement plans and restricted asbestos investments.\nFinancial information relating to the Company’s reportable segments is as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nEBITA for the Building Solutions EMEA/LA segment includes equity income (loss) of $(\n39\n) million, $\n1\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(2)\nRefer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure related to the water systems AFFF settlement and insurance recoveries.\n102\n(1)\nAssets for the Building Solutions EMEA/LA segment includes investments in partially-owned affiliates of $\n57\nmillion, $\n130\nmillion and $\n115\nmillion, as of September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, no customer exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales.\n103\nGeographic Segments\nFinancial information relating to the Company’s operations by geographic area is as follows (in millions):\nNet sales attributed to geographic locations are based on the location of where the sale originated. Long-lived assets by geographic location consist of net property, plant and equipment.\n20.\nGUARANTEES\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries at the business segment level have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions and would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance. Performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company offers warranties to its customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. A typical warranty program requires that the Company replace defective products within a specified time period from the date of sale.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of the Company’s total product warranty liability were as follows (in millions).\n104\n21.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe following table presents the location and amount of reserves for environmental liabilities in the Company's consolidated statements of financial position (in millions):\nThe Company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters described below are probable and reasonably estimable based on experience and ongoing developments in those matters, including continued study and analysis of ongoing remediation obligations. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over an estimated period of up to\n20\nyears. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss, if any, in excess of the established accruals for environmental liabilities at this time.\nA substantial portion of the Company's environmental reserves relates to ongoing long-term remediation efforts to address contamination relating to Aqueous Film Forming Foam (\"AFFF\") containing perfluorooctane sulfonate (\"PFOS\"), perfluorooctanoic acid (\"PFOA\"), and/or other per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS\") at or near the Tyco Fire Products L.P. (“Tyco Fire Products”) Fire Technology Center (\"FTC\") located in Marinette, Wisconsin and surrounding areas in the City of Marinette and Town of Peshtigo, Wisconsin, as well as the continued remediation of PFAS, arsenic and other contaminants at the Tyco Fire Products Stanton Street manufacturing facility also located in Marinette, Wisconsin (the “Stanton Street Facility”).\nPFOA, PFOS, and other PFAS compounds are being studied by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and other environmental and health agencies and researchers. In March 2021, EPA published its final determination to regulate PFOS and PFOA in drinking water. On April 10, 2024, EPA announced the final National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (“NPDWR”) for six PFAS compounds including PFOA and PFOS. The NPDWR established legally enforceable levels, called Maximum Contaminant Levels, of 4.0 parts per trillion (\"ppt\") for each of PFOA and PFOS, 10 ppt for each of PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX Chemicals), and a Hazard Index of one for mixtures containing two or more of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBA. In February 2024, EPA released two proposed rules relating to PFAS under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”): one rule proposes to list nine PFAS (including PFOA and PFOS) as “hazardous constituents,” and a second rule proposes to clarify that hazardous waste regulated under the rule includes not only substances listed or identified as hazardous waste in the regulations, but also any substances that meet the statutory definition of hazardous waste.\nIn August 2022, EPA published a proposed rule that would designate PFOA and PFOS as “hazardous substances” under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"). In April 2023, EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"ANPR\") seeking input on whether it should expand the proposed rule to designate as \"hazardous substances\" under CERCLA: (1) seven additional PFAS; (2) the precursors to PFOA, PFOS, and the seven additional PFAS; or (3) entire categories of PFAS. On April 17, 2024, the EPA Administrator signed the final rule designating PFOA and PFOS, along with their salts and structural isomers, as “hazardous substances.”\nIt is not possible to estimate the Company’s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved, the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties, the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors, the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted, changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in soil, groundwater and drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages, the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment, the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites, and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur. It is possible that technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the results of additional environmental studies or other factors could change the Company's expectations with respect to future charges and cash outlays, and such changes could be material to the Company's future results of operations, financial condition or cash\n105\nflows. Nevertheless, the Company does not currently believe that any claims, penalties or costs in addition to the amounts accrued will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, the Company has identified asset retirement obligations for environmental matters that are expected to be addressed at the retirement, disposal, removal or abandonment of existing owned facilities. Conditional asset retirement obligations were $\n7\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFTC-Related Matters\nFTC Remediation\nThe use of fire-fighting foams at the FTC was primarily for training and testing purposes to ensure that such products sold by the Company’s affiliates, Chemguard, Inc. (\"Chemguard\") and Tyco Fire Products, were effective at suppressing high intensity fires that may occur at military installations, airports or elsewhere. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, Tyco Fire Products completed its previously announced plan to discontinue the production and sale of fluorinated firefighting foams, including AFFF products, and has transitioned to non-fluorinated foam alternatives.\nTyco Fire Products has been engaged in remediation activities at the Stanton Street Facility since 1990. Its corporate predecessor, Ansul Incorporated (“Ansul”), manufactured arsenic-based agricultural herbicides at the Stanton Street Facility, which resulted in significant arsenic contamination of soil and groundwater on the site and in parts of the adjoining Menominee River. In 2009, Ansul entered into an Administrative Consent Order (the \"Consent Order\") with the EPA to address the presence of arsenic at the site. Under this agreement, Tyco Fire Products’ principal obligations are to contain the arsenic contamination on the site, pump and treat on-site groundwater, dredge, treat and properly dispose of contaminated sediments in the adjoining river areas, and monitor contamination levels on an ongoing basis. Activities completed under the Consent Order since 2009 include the installation of a subsurface barrier wall around the facility to contain contaminated groundwater, the installation and ongoing operation and monitoring of a groundwater extraction and treatment system and the dredging and offsite disposal of treated river sediment. In addition to ongoing remediation activities, the Company is also working with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (\"WDNR\") to investigate and remediate the presence of PFAS at or near the Stanton Street Facility as part of the evaluation and remediation of PFAS in the Marinette region.\nTyco Fire Products is operating and monitoring at the FTC a Groundwater Extraction and Treatment System (\"GETS\"), a permanent groundwater remediation system that extracts groundwater containing PFAS, treats it using advanced filtration systems, and returns the treated water to the environment. Tyco Fire Products has also completed the removal and disposal of PFAS-affected soil from the FTC. The Company's reserves for continued remediation of the FTC, the Stanton Street Facility and surrounding areas in Marinette and Peshtigo are based on estimates of costs associated with the long-term remediation actions, including the continued operation of the GETS, the implementation of long-term drinking water solutions for the area impacted by groundwater migrating from the FTC, continued monitoring and testing of groundwater monitoring wells, the operation and wind-down of other legacy remediation and treatment systems and the completion of ongoing investigation obligations.\nFTC-Related Litigation\nOn June 21, 2019, the WDNR announced that it had received from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (“WDHS”) a recommendation for groundwater quality standards as to, among other compounds, PFOA and PFOS. The WDHS recommended a groundwater enforcement standard for PFOA and PFOS of 20 parts per trillion. Although Wisconsin approved final regulatory standards for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water and surface water in February 2022, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board did not approve WDNR's proposed standards for PFOA and PFOS in groundwater. In August 2024, WDNR issued a new proposed rule to adopt the EPA Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFAS in drinking water. The WDNR initiated a rulemaking proceeding that would establish groundwater quality standards for PFOA, PFOS, perfluorobutane sulfonic acid and its potassium salt (“PFBS”) and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and its ammonium salt (“HFPO-DA”). Pursuant to state law, the WDNR has stopped work on the proposed rule and notified the state legislature that, following economic analysis, the proposed costs would exceed statutory thresholds. As a result, the state legislature is required to authorize the WDNR to allow the rulemaking to continue.\nIn July 2019, the Company received a letter from the WDNR directing the expansion of the evaluation of PFAS in the Marinette region to include (1) biosolids sludge produced by the City of Marinette Waste Water Treatment Plant and spread on certain fields in the area and (2) the Menominee and Peshtigo Rivers. On October 16, 2019, the WDNR issued a “Notice of Noncompliance” to Tyco Fire Products and Johnson Controls, Inc. regarding the WDNR’s July 2019 letter. The WDNR issued a further letter regarding the issue on November 4, 2019. In February 2020, the WDNR sent a letter to Tyco Fire Products and\n106\nJohnson Controls, Inc. further directing the expansion of the evaluation of PFAS in the Marinette region to include investigation activities south and west of the previously defined FTC study area. In September 2021, the WDNR sent an additional “Notice of Noncompliance” to Tyco Fire Products and Johnson Controls, Inc. concerning land-applied biosolids, which reviewed and responded to the Company’s biosolids investigation conducted to that date. On April 10, 2023, the WDNR issued a third “Notice of Noncompliance” to Tyco Fire Products and Johnson Controls, Inc. concerning land-applied biosolids in the Marinette region. Tyco Fire Products and Johnson Controls, Inc. believe that they have complied with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company cannot predict what regulatory or enforcement actions, if any, might result from the WDNR’s actions, or the consequences of any such actions, including the potential assessment of penalties.\nIn March 2022, the Wisconsin Department of Justice (“WDOJ”) filed a civil enforcement action against Johnson Controls Inc. and Tyco Fire Products in Wisconsin state court relating to environmental matters at the FTC (\nState of Wisconsin v. Tyco Fire Products, LP and Johnson Controls, Inc.\n, Case No. 22-CX-1 (filed March 14, 2022 in Circuit Court in Marinette County, Wisconsin)). The WDOJ alleges that the Company failed to timely report the presence of PFAS chemicals at the FTC, and that the Company has not sufficiently investigated or remediated PFAS at or near the FTC. The WDOJ seeks monetary penalties and an injunction ordering these\ntwo\nsubsidiaries to complete a site investigation and cleanup of PFAS contamination in accordance with the WDNR's requests. The parties are engaged in summary judgment and pretrial motions and the court has set a trial date of March 3, 2025.\nIn October 2022, the Town of Peshtigo filed a tort action in Wisconsin state court against Tyco Fire Products, Johnson Controls Inc., Chemguard, Inc., and ChemDesign, Inc. relating to environmental matters at the FTC (\nTown of Peshtigo v. Tyco Fire Products L.P. et al.\n, Case No. 2022CV000234 (filed October 18, 2022 in Circuit Court in Marinette County, Wisconsin)). The Town alleges that use of AFFF products at the FTC caused contamination of water supplies in Peshtigo. The Town seeks monetary penalties and an injunction ordering abatement of PFAS contamination in Peshtigo. The case has been removed to federal court and transferred to a multi-district litigation (\"MDL\") before the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.\nIn November 2022, individuals filed\nsix\nactions in Dane County, Wisconsin alleging personal injury and/or property damage against Tyco Fire Products, Johnson Controls Inc., Chemguard, and other unaffiliated defendants related to environmental matters at the FTC. Plaintiffs allege that use of AFFF products at the FTC and activities by third parties unrelated to the Company contaminated nearby drinking water sources, surface waters, and other natural resources and properties, including their personal properties. The individuals seek monetary damages for their personal injury and/or property damage. These lawsuits have been transferred to the MDL. Subsequently, several additional plaintiffs have direct-filed in the MDL complaints with similar allegations.\nThe Company is vigorously defending each of these cases and believes that it has meritorious defenses, but it is presently unable to predict the duration, scope, or outcome of these actions.\nAqueous Film-Forming Foam (\"AFFF\") Matters\nAFFF Litigation\nTwo\nof the Company's subsidiaries, Chemguard and Tyco Fire Products, have been named, along with other defendant manufacturers, suppliers and distributors, and, in some cases, certain subsidiaries of the Company affiliated with Chemguard and Tyco Fire Products, in a number of class action and other lawsuits relating to the use of fire-fighting foam products by the U.S. Department of Defense (the \"DOD\") and others for fire suppression purposes and related training exercises. Plaintiffs generally allege that the firefighting foam products contain or break down into the chemicals PFOS and PFOA and/or other PFAS compounds and that the use of these products by others at various airbases, airports and other sites resulted in the release of these chemicals into the environment and ultimately into communities’ drinking water supplies neighboring those airports, airbases and other sites. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages, including damages for alleged personal injuries, medical monitoring, diminution in property values, investigation and remediation costs, and natural resources damages, and also seek punitive damages and injunctive relief to address remediation of the alleged contamination.\nIn September 2018, Tyco Fire Products and Chemguard filed a Petition for Multidistrict Litigation with the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) seeking to consolidate all existing and future federal cases into one jurisdiction. On December 7, 2018, the JPML issued an order transferring various AFFF cases to the MDL. Additional cases have been identified for transfer to or are being directly filed in the MDL.\n107\nAFFF Municipal and Water Provider Cases\nChemguard and Tyco Fire Products have been named as defendants in more than\n970\ncases in federal and state courts involving municipal or water provider plaintiffs that were filed in state or federal courts originating from\n35\nstates and territories. The vast majority of these cases have been transferred to or were directly filed in the MDL, and it is anticipated that the remaining cases will be transferred to the MDL. These municipal and water provider plaintiffs generally allege that the use of the defendants’ fire-fighting foam products at fire training academies, municipal airports, Air National Guard bases, or Navy or Air Force bases released PFOS and PFOA into public water supply wells and/or other public property, allegedly requiring remediation.\nTyco Fire Products and Chemguard are also periodically notified by other municipal entities that those entities may assert claims regarding PFOS and/or PFOA contamination allegedly resulting from the use of AFFF.\nWater Systems AFFF Settlement Agreement\nOn April 12, 2024, Tyco Fire Products agreed to a settlement with a nationwide class of public water systems that detected PFAS in their drinking water systems that they allege to be associated with the use of AFFF. Under the terms of the agreement, Tyco Fire Products agreed to contribute $\n750\nmillion to resolve these PFAS claims. The settlement releases these claims against Tyco Fire Products, Chemguard, and other related corporate entities. In connection with the settlement, a charge for $\n750\nmillion was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\nTyco Fire Products contributed an initial payment of $\n250\nmillion in June 2024, with the remaining $\n500\nmillion due by the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Prior to the date of the final contribution, Tyco Fire Products has agreed to contribute any applicable insurance recoveries in excess of the initial $\n250\nmillion payment, up to the remaining $\n500\nmillion due, within a specified period following the receipt of such recovery. During fiscal 2024, the Company recorded expected insurance recoveries of $\n371\nmillion in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and collected insurance recoveries of $\n349\nmillion. In accordance with its agreement and recent insurance recovery, Tyco Fire Products made an additional payment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 of approximately $\n85\nmillion, reducing its final payment to approximately $\n415\nmillion.\nThe amounts and timing of any additional insurance recoveries are uncertain.\nThere are still several procedural and legal steps that must occur before the settlement is final and the remaining payment is made. The settlement is subject to final approval by the MDL court and other contingencies, and that process is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2025.\nThe class of public water systems included in this settlement broadly includes any public water system (as defined in the settlement agreement) that has detected PFAS in its drinking water sources as of May 15, 2024. The following systems are excluded from the settlement class: water systems owned and operated by a State or the United States government; systems that have not detected the presence of PFAS as of May 15, 2024; small transient water systems; privately-owned drinking water wells; and the water system in the city of Marinette, Wisconsin (which is included only if it so requests). The settlement does not resolve claims of public water systems that request exclusion from the class (“opt out”) pursuant to the process to be established by the MDL court. It also does not resolve potential future claims of public water systems that detect PFAS in their water systems for the first time after May 15, 2024, or certain claims not related to drinking water, such as separate alleged claims relating to real property damage or stormwater or wastewater treatment. Finally, this settlement does not affect the other categories of cases that remain at issue in the MDL, such as personal injury cases, property damage cases, other types of class actions, claims brought by state or territory attorneys general, or other types of damages alleged to be related to the historical use of AFFF manufactured and sold by Tyco Fire Products and Chemguard. While it is reasonably possible that the excluded systems or claims could result in additional future lawsuits, claims, assessments or proceedings, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such matters, and as such, the Company is unable to develop an estimate of a possible loss or range of losses, if any, at this time.\nThe settlement does not constitute an admission of liability or wrongdoing by Tyco Fire Products or Chemguard. If the MDL court does not approve the agreement or certain terms are not fulfilled, Tyco Fire Products and Chemguard will continue to defend themselves in the litigation.\nAFFF Putative Class Actions\nChemguard and Tyco Fire Products are named in\n45\npending putative class actions in federal courts originating from\n18\nstates and territories. All of these cases have been direct-filed in or transferred to the MDL. In addition, six proposed class actions were filed in Canada (British Columbia, Manitoba, Quebec and Ontario) in the past year against Tyco Fire Products and other\n108\nmanufacturers on behalf of various classes of members who consumed or were exposed to products or supplies that were allegedly contaminated by AFFF.\nAFFF Individual or Mass Actions\nThere are more than\n8,300\nindividual or “mass” actions pending that were filed in state or federal courts originating from\n52\nstates and territories against Chemguard and Tyco Fire Products and other defendants in which the plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages, including damages for alleged personal injuries, medical monitoring, and alleged diminution in property values. The cases involve plaintiffs from various states including approximately\n7,000\nplaintiffs in Colorado and more than\n8,300\nother plaintiffs. The vast majority of these matters have been tagged for transfer to, transferred to, or directly-filed in the MDL, and it is anticipated that several newly-filed state court actions will be similarly tagged and transferred. There are several matters that are proceeding in state courts, including actions in Arizona, Illinois, Virginia and Wisconsin.\nTyco and Chemguard are also periodically notified by other individuals that they may assert claims regarding PFOS and/or PFOA contamination allegedly resulting from the use of AFFF.\nAFFF State or U.S. Territory Attorneys General Litigation\nIn June 2018, the State of New York filed a lawsuit in New York state court (\nState of New York v. The 3M Company et al\nNo. 904029-18 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Albany County)) against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to alleged PFOS and PFOA contamination purportedly resulting from firefighting foams used at locations across New York, including Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh and Gabreski Air National Guard Base in Southampton, Plattsburgh Air Force Base in Plattsburgh, Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, and unspecified “other” sites throughout the State. The lawsuit seeks to recover costs and natural resource damages associated with contamination at these sites. This suit has been removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and transferred to the MDL.\nIn February 2019, the State of New York filed a second lawsuit in New York state court (\nState of New York v. The 3M Company et al\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct., Albany County)), against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to alleged PFOS and PFOA contamination purportedly resulting from firefighting foams used at additional locations across New York. This suit has been removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and transferred to the MDL. In July 2019, the State of New York filed a third lawsuit in New York state court (\nState of New York v. The 3M Company et al\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct., Albany County)), against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to alleged PFOS and PFOA contamination purportedly resulting from firefighting foams used at further additional locations across New York. This suit has been removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and transferred to the MDL. In November 2019, the State of New York filed a fourth lawsuit in New York state court (\nState of New York v. The 3M Company et al\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct., Albany County)), against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to alleged PFOS and PFOA contamination purportedly resulting from firefighting foams used at further additional locations across New York. This suit has been removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL.\nIn April 2021, the State of Alaska filed a lawsuit in the superior court of the State of Alaska against a number of manufacturers and other defendants, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to PFOS and PFOA damage of the State’s land and natural resources allegedly resulting from the use of firefighting foams at various locations throughout the State. The State’s case has been removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL. The State of Alaska has also named a number of manufacturers and other defendants, including affiliates of the Company, as third-party defendants in\ntwo\ncases brought by individuals against the State. These\ntwo\ncases have also been transferred to the MDL.\nIn early November 2021, the Attorney General of the State of North Carolina filed\nfour\nindividual lawsuits in the superior courts of the State of North Carolina against a number of manufacturers and other defendants, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to PFOS and PFOA damage of the State’s land, natural resources, and property allegedly resulting from the use of firefighting foams at four separate locations throughout the State. These\nfour\ncases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL. In October 2022, the Attorney General filed\ntwo\nsimilar lawsuits in the superior courts of the State of North Carolina regarding alleged PFAS damages at two additional locations. These\ntwo\ncases have also been removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL.\nIn addition,\n33\nother states and territories have filed\n35\nlawsuits against a number of manufacturers and other defendants, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to PFAS damage of each of those State's environmental and natural resources allegedly resulting from the manufacture, storage, sale, distribution, marketing, and use of PFAS-containing AFFF within each respective State. The states and territories are: Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of\n109\nColumbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico. All of these complaints, if not filed directly in the MDL, have been removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL.\nOther AFFF Related Matters\nIn March 2020, the Kalispel Tribe of Indians (a federally recognized Tribe) and two tribal corporations filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, and the United States with respect to PFAS contamination allegedly resulting from the use and disposal of AFFF by the United States Air Force at and around Fairchild Air Force Base in eastern Washington. This case has been transferred to the MDL.\nIn October 2022, the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians (a federally recognized tribe) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to PFAS contamination allegedly resulting from the use and disposal of AFFF at Duluth Air National Guard Base in Duluth, Minnesota. This complaint has been transferred to the MDL.\nIn July 2023, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (a federally recognized tribe) direct-filed a lawsuit in the MDL against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to PFAS contamination allegedly resulting from the use and disposal of AFFF at Duluth Air National Guard Base in Duluth, Minnesota.\nThe Company is vigorously defending all of the above AFFF matters and believes that it has meritorious defenses to class certification and the claims asserted, including statutes of limitations, the government contractor defense, various medical and scientific defenses, and other factual and legal defenses. The Company has a historical general liability insurance program and is pursuing coverage under the program from various insurers through insurance claims discussions and litigation pending in a state court in Wisconsin and a federal district court in South Carolina. The insurance litigation involves numerous factual and legal issues. There are numerous factual and legal issues to be resolved in connection with these claims. The Company is presently unable to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure beyond the water systems AFFF settlement discussed above, if any, represented by these matters, and there can be no assurance that any such exposure will not be material.\nAsbestos Matters\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with numerous other third parties, are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. These cases have typically involved product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components.\nThe following table presents the location and amount of asbestos-related assets and liabilities in the Company's consolidated statements of financial position (in millions):\n110\nThe following table presents the components of asbestos-related assets (in millions):\nThe amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets are based on the Company's strategies for resolving its asbestos claims, currently available information, and a number of estimates and assumptions. Key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year, the average cost of resolution of claims, the identity of defendants, the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers, amount of insurance, and the solvency risk with respect to the Company's insurance carriers. Many of these factors are closely linked, such that a change in one variable or assumption may impact one or more of the others, and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the Company's asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets. Furthermore, predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period. Other factors that may affect the Company's liability and cash payments for asbestos-related matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries. As a result, actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the Company's calculations vary significantly from actual results.\nSelf-Insured Liabilities\nThe Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities. The determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience. The Company maintains captive insurance companies to manage a portion of its insurable liabilities.\nThe following table presents the location and amount of self-insured liabilities in the Company's consolidated statements of financial position (in millions):\nThe following table presents the location and amount of insurance receivables in the Company's consolidated statements of financial position (in millions):\nOther Matters\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of its businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, commercial and contractual matters, and various other casualty matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company, it is management’s opinion that\n111\nnone of these will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented."

Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, and that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nRemediation\nof Previously Reported Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company's management concluded that a material weakness existed as of September 30, 2023, as previously disclosed in “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\" of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, as the Company did not maintain sufficient information technology (“IT”) controls to prevent or detect, on a timely basis, unauthorized access to certain of its financial reporting systems. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to access monitoring, intrusion detection and response capability, patch management and backup and recovery such that recovery from a cybersecurity incident could be performed in a timely manner.\nThe Company has taken corrective action to remediate and address the IT control deficiencies that aggregated to the noted material weakness. The controls that address the material weakness have been designed, implemented and operated effectively as of September 30, 2024 and for a sufficient period of time during fiscal 2024 in order for management to test these controls and conclude that the material weakness had been remediated as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n112"
