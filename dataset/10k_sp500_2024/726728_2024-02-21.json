    "text": "In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to\n“Realty Income,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” refer to Realty Income Corporation and our subsidiaries.\nTHE COMPANY\nRealty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company\n®\n, is an S&P 500 company and member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats\n®\nindex for having increased its dividend every year for over 25 consecutive years. We invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. We are structured as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), requiring us to annually distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains) in the form of dividends to our stockholders. The monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow generated from real estate in which we own or hold interests in under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients.\nRealty Income was founded in 1969, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\": O) in 1994. Over the past 55 years, Realty Income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients. As of December 31, 2023, we owned or held interests in 13,458 properties located in the United States (\"U.S.\") and Europe.\nOn January 23, 2024, we closed on our previously announced merger with Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (\"Spirit\", formerly NYSE: SRC), which is further described in note\n21,\nSubsequent Events,\nto the consolidated financial statements. The Spirit portfolio consisted of 2,018 U.S. retail, industrial, and other properties across 49 states. With assets that are highly complementary to our existing portfolio, this transaction enhances the diversification and depth our real estate portfolio and will allow us to strengthen our longstanding relationships with existing clients and curate new ones.\nBUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY\nWe believe that actively managing a diversified portfolio of commercial properties under long-term, net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income. A net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) fixed increases, (2) increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients’ gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.\nDiversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy. We believe that diversification of the portfolio by client, industry, geography, and property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration. Our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio and as of December 31, 2023, we owned or held interests in 13,458 properties located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain\nand doing business in 86 industries.\nAs we look to continue to expand geographically across Europe, we focus upon building relationships with new multinational clients that seek a real estate partner with an expanding geographic footprint.\nInvestment Strategy\nWe seek to acquire, invest in and develop high-quality real estate that our clients consider important to the successful operation of their businesses. We generally seek to own or hold interests in commercial real estate that has some or all of the following characteristics:\n•\nProperties in markets or locations important to our clients;\n•\nProperties with strong demographic attributes or that we deem to be profitable for our clients;\n•\nProperties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs;\n•\nProperties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents for similar properties;\n2\n•\nProperties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term net lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases;\n•\nProperties that leverage relationships with clients, sellers, investors, or developers as part of a long-term strategy; and\n•\nProperties that leverage our proprietary insights, including those in locations and geographic markets we expect to remain strong or strengthen in the future.\nWe typically seek to invest in properties or portfolios of properties owned or leased by clients that are already or could become leaders in their respective businesses supported by mechanisms including (but not limited to) occupancy of prime real estate locations, pricing, merchandise assortment, service, quality, economies of scale, consumer branding, e-commerce, and advertising. We have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities, often using our relationships with various clients, owners/developers, brokers, and advisers to uncover and secure transactions. We also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations, clients, and industries for investment. This research expertise is instrumental to uncovering investment opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value.\nIn selecting potential investments, we generally look for clients with the following attributes:\n•\nReliable and sustainable cash flow, including demonstrated economic resiliency;\n•\nRevenue and cash flow from multiple sources;\n•\nAre willing to sign a long-term lease (10 or more years); and\n•\nAre large owners and users of real estate.\nFrom a retail perspective, our investment strategy is to target clients that have a service, non-discretionary, and/or low-price-point component to their business. We target investments with clients who have demonstrated resiliency to e-commerce or have a strong omnichannel retail strategy, uniting brick-and-mortar and mobile browsing, both of which reflect the continued importance of last mile retail, the movement of goods to their final destination, real estate as part of a customer experience and supply chain strategy. Our overall investments (including last mile retail) are driven by an optimal portfolio strategy that, among other considerations, targets allocation ranges by asset class and industry. We review our strategy periodically and stress test our portfolio in a variety of positive and negative economic scenarios to ensure we deliver consistent earnings growth and value creation across economic cycles. As a result of the execution of this strategy, approximately 91% of our annualized retail contractual rent on\nDecember 31, 2023, is derived from our clients with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties.\nAfter applying this investment strategy, we pursue those transactions where we believe we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable risk-adjusted returns. We will continue to evaluate all investments for consistency with our objective of owning net lease assets.\nUnderwriting Strategy\nTo be considered for acquisition, investments must meet stringent underwriting requirements. We analyze investments based on one or more of the following criteria:\n•\nIndustry, client (including credit), and market conditions;\n•\nExpected financial returns under various scenarios (including default);\n•\nThe value of real estate (based on replacement cost, comparative rental rates and alternative uses), or other collateral backing the client’s contractual obligations; and\n•\nStore profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available or the importance of the real estate location to the operations of the clients’ business.\nWith regard to real estate investments, we typically own the land and building in which a client conducts its business or which are critical to the client’s ability to generate revenue. It has been our experience that clients must retain their profitable and critical locations to survive. Therefore, in the event of reorganization, we believe they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property.\nThus, as the property owner, we believe that we should fare better than unsecured creditors of the same client in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by our client during reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new client or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases\n3\ncan be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of our clients’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition.\nWe conduct comprehensive reviews of the business segments and industries in which our clients operate. In addition, prior to entering any transaction, our credit research team conducts a review of a client’s credit quality. The information reviewed may include reports and filings, including any public credit ratings, financial statements, debt and equity analyst reports, and reviews of corporate credit spreads, stock prices, market capitalization, and other financial metrics. We conduct due diligence, including financial reviews of the client, monitor our clients’ credit quality on an ongoing basis, and provide summaries of these findings to management.\nAt December 31, 2023, 39.6% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent (as defined in \"Property Portfolio Information\"\nbelow) comes from properties leased to our investment grade clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies. At December 31, 2023, our top 20 clients (based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent) represented 40.2% of our annualized rent and 10 of these clients have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries or affiliates of investment grade companies.\nAsset Management Strategy\nIn addition to pursuing new properties for investment, we seek to increase earnings and dividends through active asset management.\nGenerally, our asset management efforts seek to achieve:\n•\nRent increases during and at the expiration of existing leases, when market conditions permit;\n•\nOptimum exposure to certain clients, industries, and markets through re-leasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties;\n•\nMaximum asset-level returns on properties that are renewed, re-leased or sold; and\n•\nAdditional value creation opportunities from the existing portfolio by leveraging internal capabilities to enhance individual properties, pursue alternative uses, and derive ancillary revenue.\nAs part of our ongoing credit and predictive analytics research, we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our clients, our clients’ industries, and the real estate locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality. Our active asset management strategy pursues asset sales when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:\n•\nGenerate higher returns;\n•\nEnhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;\n•\nExtend our average remaining lease term; and/or\n•\nStrategically decrease client, industry, or geographic concentration.\nThe active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy of maintaining high occupancy.\nCapital Philosophy\nOur goal is to deliver dependable monthly dividends to our stockholders that increase over time. Historically, we have met our principal short-term and long-term capital needs, including the funding of high-quality real estate acquisitions, property development, and capital expenditures, by issuing common stock, preferred stock, long-term unsecured notes and term loan borrowings. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. We may issue common stock when we believe our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of an offering to be accretively invested into additional properties or to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, or shorter-term debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us.\nHuman Capital\nWe put great effort into cultivating an inclusive company culture. We seek to hire talented employees with diverse backgrounds and perspectives and look to foster an environment that allows for regular, open communication where capable team members have fulfilling careers and are encouraged to engage with and make a positive impact on our Company, its operations, its business partners, and the communities in which we operate.\n4\nEmployees operate as \"One Team\" and, together, we are committed to providing an engaging work environment centered on our values of:\n•\nDo the Right Thing,\n•\nTake Ownership,\n•\nEmpower Each Other,\n•\nCelebrate Differences, and\n•\nGive More than We Take.\nRecruitment, Development and Retention\nAt the heart of our corporate culture lie our dedicated employees, who form the foundation of our organization, representing our most valuable assets. As of December 31, 2023, our workforce comprises 418 professionals. The majority of our talented team members are recruited and hired from the communities in which we operate, embodying our commitment to local engagement. To extend the scope of our talent acquisition efforts, we have implemented various initiatives, including college and high school internship programs. Our comprehensive approach encompasses a wide range of strategies, such as engaging with affinity associations, utilizing targeted job advertisements, employing sourcing software that emphasizes diversity criteria, and fostering employee referrals. These measures ensure that we continually attract and embrace a diverse pool of candidates. Furthermore, we recognize that internal mobility within our organization unlocks yet another great source of talent. By encouraging our current employees to expand their skills and take on new challenges, we tap into a rich reservoir of potential that enhances our workforce's capabilities and reinforces our corporate culture.\nWe offer leadership development programs and train on critical topics such as ethics, insider trading, anti-discrimination and harassment, cybersecurity, diversity, equality and inclusion, safety, and other Company policies. We provide professional development opportunities for One Team members and provide assistance and support to employees who are pursuing job-related licenses, certifications, and continuing education.\nEmployee retention is essential for supporting a positive culture and productive workforce. Accordingly, we believe we offer competitive compensation and benefits packages. Benefits include medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees and their families, 401(k) or equivalent plans with Company matching opportunity; paid time-off or equivalent vacation; disability and life insurance; and, in years that the Company's performance meets certain goals, the ability to earn equity in the Company subject to applicable vesting periods.\nAdditional information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives is available in our annual Proxy Statement and Sustainability Report, both of which can be found on our website. Information on our website, including our Sustainability Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\nDiversity, Equality and Inclusion (DE&I)\nWe believe that the diversity of our One Team and our dedication to inclusion are foundational to our success. We continue DE&I training and learning sessions to build employee awareness and action while also encouraging open discussion amongst colleagues. Our DE&I initiatives are designed to enhance knowledge, deepen understanding, facilitate conversations on critical DE&I topics, encourage inclusive interactions, and cultivate a sense of belonging. In addition, we conduct pay equity analyses to help ensure equitable pay for employees who perform similar work under similar circumstances, regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity.\nEmployee Health, Safety and Wellbeing\nWe prioritize the health, safety, and wellbeing of our team members. Our wellbeing program is designed to empower employees through a range of activities and educational initiatives that contribute to both their personal and professional development. In fostering a healthy work environment, we promote work-life balance by offering flexible schedules and providing discounted fitness programs, paid family leave, parental leave, onsite lactation rooms, an infant-at-work program, employee health fairs, and an employee assistance program, among other programs and services.\nGovernment Regulation\nGeneral\nCompliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA. We believe that our properties generally have the necessary permits and approvals needed and are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n5\nEnvironmental Matters\nInvestments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. While our tenants are generally primarily responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, we as owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination; the timing of the contamination; the cause of the contamination; or the party responsible for the contamination of the property. We have no knowledge of any hazardous substances existing on our properties in violation of any applicable laws; however, no assurance can be given that such substances are not currently located on any of our properties.\nSome of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near properties that contain or have contained storage tanks for petroleum products or that involve or involved the use of hazardous or toxic substances. Under certain laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant may be required to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases or threats of releases, and may be held liable to a government entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with actual or threatened contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the contamination. The liability may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties for their fair share toward these costs. In addition, strict environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions and water discharges. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations.\nEnvironmental laws also govern asbestos-containing materials (“ACM”). Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations, and we could be subject to lawsuits if personal injury from exposure to ACM occurs. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM. In addition, our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or other airborne contaminants. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. Further, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990\nOur properties are generally required to comply with ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities,” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA, as well as a number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations, may require modifications to properties we currently own and any properties we purchase, or may restrict renovations of those properties. Noncompliance with these laws or regulations could result in fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of costs to make modifications to attain compliance. Although our tenants are generally responsible for compliance with the ADA and other similar laws or regulations, we could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with such laws or regulations. As of December 31, 2023, we have not received notice from any governmental authority, nor are we otherwise aware, of any non-compliance with the ADA that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain a corporate website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, Form 3s, Form 4s, Form 5s, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). None of the information on our website is deemed to be part of this report.\n6\nPROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION\nAt December 31, 2023, out of the 13,458 properties that we owned or held interests in, 13,265 properties were vastly leased under net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) fixed increases, (2) increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients' gross sales above a specified level.\nWe define total portfolio annualized contractual rent as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables, as of the balance sheet date, multiplied by 12, excluding percentage rent, interest income on loans and preferred equity investments, and including our pro rata share of such revenues from properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe total portfolio annualized contractual rent is a useful supplemental operating measure, as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter. Total portfolio annualized contractual rent has not been reduced to reflect reserves recorded as adjustments to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (\"U.S. GAAP\") rental revenue in the periods presented.\nTop 10 Industry Concentrations\nWe are engaged in a single business activity, which is the leasing of property to clients, generally on a net basis. That business activity spans various geographic boundaries and includes property types and clients engaged in various industries. Even though we have a single segment, we believe our investors continue to view diversification as a key component of our investment philosophy and so we believe it remains important to present certain information regarding our property portfolio classified according to the business of the respective clients, expressed as a percentage of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent:\n(1)\nThe presentation of Top 10 Industry Concentrations combines total portfolio contractual rent from the U.S. and Europe. Europe consists of properties in the U.K., starting in May 2019, in Spain, starting in September 2021, in Italy, starting in October 2022, in Ireland, starting in June 2023, and in France, Germany, and Portugal, starting in December 2023.\nProperty Type Composition\nThe following table sets forth certain property type information regarding our property portfolio as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nExcludes 2,962 acres of leased land categorized as agriculture at December 31, 2023.\n(2)\nIncludes our pro rata share of leasable square feet of properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures.\n(3)\n\"Other\" includes 27 properties classified as agriculture, consisting of approximately 0.3 million leasable square feet and $38.0 million in annualized contractual rent and 10 properties classified as office, consisting of approximately 2.1 million leasable square feet and $27.4 million in annualized contractual rent, as well as one land parcel under development.\nClient Diversification\nThe following table sets forth the 20 largest clients in our property portfolio, expressed as a percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent, which does not give effect to deferred rent, at December 31, 2023:\n(1)\nAmounts for each client are calculated independently; therefore, the individual percentages may not sum to the total. Excludes non-rental contractual income on loans and preferred equity investments.\nLease Expirations\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the timing of the lease term expirations in our portfolio (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the client) and their contribution to total portfolio annualized contractual rent as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nLeases on our multi-client properties are counted separately in the table above. This table excludes 270 vacant units.\nGeographic Diversification\nThe following table sets forth certain geographic information regarding our property portfolio as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the documents incorporated by reference, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

    "text": "This “Risk Factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders.” Unless expressly stated otherwise, the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of\npreferred stock which may be outstanding from time to time, while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of preferred stock which may be outstanding from time to time.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIn order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties. The acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures.\nWe face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties. We expect competition from businesses, individuals, fiduciary accounts and plans, and other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.\nNegative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential clients, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new clients, re-lease space, collect rent or renew leases, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.\nCash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to our clients on economically favorable terms and to collect rent from our clients on a timely basis. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:\n•\nLack of demand in areas where our properties are located;\n•\nInability to retain existing clients and attract new clients;\n•\nOversupply of space and changes in market rental rates;\n•\nDeclines in our clients’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations (including as a result from changes in consumer behaviors or preferences impacting our clients operations), economic downturns and competition within their industries from other operators;\n•\nDefaults by and bankruptcies of clients, failure of clients to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of our clients to comply with their contractual obligations;\n•\nChanges in laws, rules or regulations that negatively impact clients or our properties;\n•\nEpidemics, pandemics or outbreaks of illness, disease or virus that affect countries or regions in which our clients and their parent companies operate or in which our properties or corporate headquarters are located;\n•\nChanges in consumer behaviors (e.g., decrease in discretionary consumer spending), preferences or demographics impacting our clients' operations;\n•\nSupply chain disruptions;\n•\nEconomic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located; and\n•\nDeterioration of physical condition of our properties.\nIf our clients do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties. Leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, improvements on behalf of the client or lease transaction costs. Negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and service our indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, our clients may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them.\nAt any time, any of our clients may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. As a result, a client may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any client bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of our client’s lease and material losses to us. Further, the occurrence of a client bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish or eliminate the income we receive from our client’s lease or leases. A bankruptcy court might authorize a client to terminate one or more of its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt client for unpaid future\n8\nrent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases (it is also possible that we may not receive any unpaid future rent under terminated leases) or we may elect not to pursue claims against a client for terminated leases. Claims we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full, or at all. Client bankruptcies within a given property may also adversely impact our ability to re-release that property at favorable terms, or at all. Moreover, in the case of a client’s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy, we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions, reducing amounts we receive under those leases. As a result, client bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness.\nDownturns in any of our industries could adversely affect our clients (including, for example, the recent challenges faced by our clients in the theater industry), which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock. In addition, some of our properties are leased to clients that may have limited financial and other resources and, therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses, including any downturns that have resulted or may result from the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or pandemics, or in the regional, national or international economy. Furthermore, we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-client, net-lease retail locations in the U.S. As a result, we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and/or new jurisdictions outside the U.S. and properties leased to clients engaged in non-retail businesses. These risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties, new types of real estate locations and lease structures, and the laws and culture of non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nAs a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities.\nInvestments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. An owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination; the timing of the contamination; the cause of the contamination; or the party responsible for the contamination of the property.\nThere may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware. A number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, to operators of oil change and tune-up facilities, and operators that use chemicals and other waste products. These facilities and some other of our properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or storage tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances. Certain of our other properties, particularly those leased for industrial-type purposes, may also involve operations or activities that could give rise to environmental liabilities.\nThe presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our client's ability to continue to operate that property or our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third-party liability claims. Although our leases generally require our clients to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the clients’ activities on the properties, we could nevertheless be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no assurance that our clients could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition, or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness.\nSome of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings that contain asbestos in the future. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or ACMs, and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.\n9\nWhile we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to environmental contamination, if environmental contamination should exist on any of our properties, we could be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest. In addition, while we maintain environmental insurance policies, it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and/or that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. Our clients are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of clients’ activities on the properties. However, it is possible that one or more of our clients could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations or such environmental contamination may predate our client's lease term, and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT, it could adversely impact us, and the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities.\nWe believe that, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we cannot make any assurances that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. As we have recently expanded into new geographies and transactional structures, and may continue to do so in the future, the analyses of our REIT qualification, and our ability to ensure such qualification, have become, and may become in the future, more complex. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains). If we fail to satisfy any of the requirements for qualification as a REIT, we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to qualify as a REIT. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:\n•\nWe would be required to pay regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income;\n•\nWe would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income;\n•\nWe could be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost;\n•\nWe would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and\n•\nThis treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.\nEven if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. For example, if we have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal,\nstate and, in some cases, foreign taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us or our investors.\nThe rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Services, or the IRS, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect us or our investors, including holders of our common stock or debt securities. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other\n10\nentities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT. In addition, the tax treatment of certain of our sale-leaseback transactions could change, which could make such sale-leaseback transactions less attractive to potential sellers and lessees and negatively impact our operations.\nDistribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility.\nTo maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding net capital gains, each year. We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains) each year. In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT.\nFuture issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock.\nOur future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. Raising additional capital through the issuance of equity securities can dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans. Our Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by our Board of Directors (such as the shares of preferred stock that were issued in connection with the closing of the Merger with Spirit) which could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock.\nWe may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership, which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of our common stock. This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of, or refinance the debt on, the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain. Similarly, we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. In the event we take any action that incurs taxable gain allocated to these contributors, we may be required to make them whole under tax protection agreements. These restrictions could limit our ability to manage, control, sell or refinance an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.\nWe are subject\nto risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing.\nWe intend to incur additional indebtedness in the\nfuture, including borrowings under our $4.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and our $3.0 billion commercial paper programs.\nOur revolving credit facility grants us the option, subject to obtaining lender commitments and other customary conditions, to expand the borrowing limits thereunder to up to $5.25 billion. The credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility also governs our $250.0 million unsecured term loan facility due March 2024 and, on January 6, 2023, we entered into the term loan agreement (the “2023 term loan agreement”) governing our 2023 term loans, pursuant to which we borrowed an aggregate of approximately $1.0 billion in multicurrency borrowings. The 2023 term loan agreement also permits us to incur additional term loans, up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion in total borrowings, pursuant to an accordion expansion feature, which is subject to obtaining lender commitments and other customary conditions. The term loans pursuant to our 2023 term loan agreement mature in January 2025 with one remaining 12-month maturity extension available at our option. At December 31, 2023, we also had a total of $18.6 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities (excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums, deferred financing costs and basis adjustments on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges), including approximately $4.2 billion denominated in Sterling (of which $1.2 billion is related to our privately placed Sterling notes), $1.2 billion denominated in Euro thereunder, and approximately $822.4 million of outstanding mortgage debt (excluding unamortized net discounts and deferred financing costs).\n11\nIn connection with the consummation of the closing of the Merger on January 23, 2024, we effectively assumed Spirit’s existing term loans with various lenders. Specifically, on January 22, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $800 million in aggregate total borrowings, $300 million of which matures on August 22, 2025 and $500 million of which matures on August 20, 2027 (the “$800 million term loan agreement”), and an amended and restated term loan agreement pursuant to which we borrowed $500 million in aggregate total borrowings which matures on June 16, 2025. The $800 million term loan agreement and the $500 million term loan agreement became effective upon the closing of the Merger on January 23, 2024. Our A3/A- credit ratings provide for a borrowing rate of 80 basis points over the applicable benchmark rate, which includes adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") for US Dollar-denominated loans, adjusted Sterling Overnight Indexed Average (“SONIA”) for Sterling-denominated loans, and Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) for Euro-denominated loans. In conjunction with closing, we executed one-year variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps which fix our per annum interest rate at 5.0% over the initial term. In addition, as a result of the Merger, all outstanding secured indebtedness, liabilities, and other indebtedness of Spirit and its subsidiaries, including $2.75 billion of additional senior unsecured notes that were originally issued by Spirit Realty Capital, L.P., substantially all of which were exchanged for senior unsecured notes issued by us, became indebtedness and liabilities of ours or our subsidiaries, as the case may be, which substantially increased the total secured indebtedness and the total liabilities and other indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries.\nPursuant to our unsecured commercial paper programs we may offer and sell up to $3.0 billion of commercial paper at any time. We use our revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes issued under the commercial paper programs. Specifically, we maintain unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility equal to the aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs from time to time. We may in the future enter into amendments and restatements of our revolving credit facility and term loan facilities, or enter into new revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities, and any such amended, restated or replacement revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities may increase the amounts we are entitled to borrow, subject to customary conditions, compared to our current revolving credit facility and term loan facilities, or we may incur other indebtedness. We may also in the future increase the size of our commercial paper programs or establish new commercial paper programs. We expect that we will continue to use our current and any new revolving credit facilities we may enter into (in each case as the same may be expanded, amended or restated, if applicable, from time to time), as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes issued under our current or any new commercial paper programs that we may maintain from time to time.\nTo the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt or to pay dividends on our common stock. We also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility, term loan facilities, and commercial paper programs are variable (subject to our interest rate swaps on our term loan facilities, in effect from time to time), and the interest rates on any credit facilities and term loan facilities we may enter into in the future may be variable, and could therefore increase over time. In addition, commercial paper borrowings are short-term obligations and the interest rate on newly issued commercial paper varies according to market conditions at the time of issuance. Similarly, some of the indebtedness to which we have become subject to subsequent to the Merger may also bear interest at variable rates. In addition, while we may enter into hedging and other derivatives instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in borrowing and currency rates, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these arrangements or they may be insufficient to mitigate our exposure. We also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. Given past disruptions in the financial markets and ongoing global financial uncertainties, we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may be unwilling or unable to lend us money.\nWe have incurred and may continue to incur indebtedness that is denominated in local currencies to fund our international investments and operations. However, it is possible that such indebtedness may be insufficient or may be on unacceptable terms requiring us to use non-local currency indebtedness. In such event, we may be subject to foreign exchange rate volatility. While we may enter into hedging and other derivatives instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these arrangements or these arrangements may be insufficient to mitigate our exposure.\nOur revolving credit facility, our term loan facilities, and our mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions to holders of our common stock\n12\nand any outstanding preferred stock. The credit agreements governing our revolving credit facility and term loan facilities provide that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreements, as applicable) exists, we may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or any outstanding preferred stock, during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of (i) the sum of 95% of our adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit agreements, as applicable) for that period plus the aggregate amount of cash distributions made to holders of our outstanding preferred stock for that period, and (ii) the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the payment of income or excise taxes that would otherwise be imposed under specified sections of the Code on income we do not distribute to our stockholders, except we may repurchase or redeem shares of our outstanding preferred stock, if any, with net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock.\nThe credit agreements each provide that, in the event of a failure to pay principal, interest, or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreements, we and our subsidiaries (other than our wholly-owned subsidiaries) may not pay dividends or make other distributions on (except for (a) distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and (b) dividends and distributions described in (ii) above), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock. If any such event of default under the applicable credit agreements (or under any other credit agreement or debt instrument with similar terms that we may in the future enter into or be subject to) were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities which could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness, or prevent us from paying those dividends, other distributions, interest or principal altogether, and may adversely affect our ability to qualify, or prevent us from qualifying, as a REIT.\nOur indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock, outstanding preferred stock, and our debt securities, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements; requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and general corporate requirements; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.\nIf we default under a credit facility, loan agreement, or other debt instrument, the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and, in the case of secured indebtedness, to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral. Moreover, a default under a single loan or debt instrument may trigger cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in other indebtedness and debt instruments, giving the holders of such other indebtedness and debt instruments similar rights to demand immediate repayment and to seize and sell any collateral.\nReal estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue.\nWe are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate. In particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur, and distributions on our capital stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include:\n•\nAdverse changes in general or local economic conditions;\n•\nChanges in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;\n•\nChanges in interest rates and operating expenses (including energy costs, shortages and rationing);\n•\nCompetition within an industry and for our clients;\n•\nChanges in market rents;\n•\nInability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases;\n•\nRenewal of leases at lower rental rates;\n•\nInability to collect rental revenue from our clients due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;\n13\n•\nChanges in tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate;\n•\nUninsured property liability;\n•\nProperty damage or casualty losses;\n•\nUnexpected expenditures for capital improvements, including requirements to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;\n•\nThe need to periodically renovate and repair our properties;\n•\nRisks assumed as manager for development or redevelopment projects;\n•\nPhysical or weather-related damage to properties;\n•\nThe potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time;\n•\nActs of terrorism and war;\n•\nChanges in consumer behaviors, preferences or demographics;\n•\nThe impacts of climate change; and\n•\nActs of God and other factors beyond the control of our management.\nReal estate property investments are illiquid. We may not be able to acquire or dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly buy, sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited and U.S. and foreign tax and regulatory regimes and authorities may impose or have the effect of restricting or limiting our ability to sell properties. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value, at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us, for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our mergers and acquisitions, acquisitions, and expansion opportunities under prevailing market conditions. We are regularly engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, underwriting, and negotiating possible acquisition transactions. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future mergers and acquisitions or acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize expected cash yields, operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies, or other benefits. Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions.\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions of properties (including through the use of alternative acquisition structures such as joint ventures, partnerships, fund and other structures) that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-client, net lease retail locations in the U.S. We may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types (e.g., non-retail businesses), geographies, lease and acquisition structures, and clients who engage in non-retail businesses. These risks may be enhanced by our limited experience in managing new property types, geographies, lease and acquisition structures, clients. and the laws and/or culture of non-U.S. geographies.\nWe are subject to additional risks from our international investments and debt.\nWe have acquired and may continue to invest in properties outside of the U.S.\nThese investments may expose us to a variety of risks that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the U.S. Our international investments are subject to additional risks, including:\n•\nThe laws, rules and regulations applicable in such jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including those related to property ownership and control by foreign entities;\n•\nComplying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including corruption, employment, data protection, energy usage, health and safety and environmental regulations which may require capital expenditures to maintain or bring our\n14\nforeign properties into compliance with applicable regulations and/or may require disclosure of various environmental, social and governance matters;\n•\nFluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar (including risks related to their impact on our results of operations, hedging and other derivative arrangements used to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates, translational reporting risks, and exchange controls);\n•\nAs we may not have or have only a limited number of properties within a jurisdiction, our experience in that market and with local business may be limited, and our operating costs may be disproportionately higher until the number of properties within a jurisdiction grows;\n•\nWe may face challenges with expanding into current or new jurisdictions, such as identifying and securing investment opportunities, hiring and retaining employees, extended time periods for acquiring or disposing of investments, which may increase the cost of funding an investment, and potentially experiencing different cultural and business practices related to employees, rent adjustments, ground leases, and property ownership requirements and limitations;\n•\nChallenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to manage and regulate operations in different regions and to monitor and ensure compliance with applicable regulations, such as applicable laws related to corrupt practices, employment, licensing, construction, energy usage, climate change or environmental compliance;\n•\nUnexpected or other changes in regulatory requirements (including disclosure requirements), tax, tariffs, trade barriers and other laws within jurisdictions outside the U.S. or between the U.S. and such jurisdictions;\n•\nPotentially adverse tax consequences with respect to our properties and/or investment vehicles;\n•\nInitial limited investments within certain regions or countries may result in industry or client concentration risks;\n•\nThe impact of regional or country-specific business cycles, inflation and economic instability, including deterioration in political relations with the U.S., instability in, or further withdrawals from, the European Union or other international trade alliances or agreements; and\n•\nPolitical instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, acts of war, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities.\nWe also engage external property managers and other third parties, who assist with managing our international properties. If a property manager or third party fails to meet its obligations or terminates its services, we may need to find a replacement; however, these services may be on less favorable terms and conditions, or we may not be able to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner or at all.\nWe have incurred and may continue to incur indebtedness that is denominated in local currencies to fund our international investments and operations. However, it is possible that such indebtedness may be insufficient or may be on unacceptable terms requiring us to use non-local currency indebtedness. In such event, we may be subject to foreign exchange rate volatility which may be impacted by various factors, including those described above. While we may enter into hedging and other derivatives instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these arrangements or these arrangements may be insufficient to mitigate our exposure. For more information, see “—We are subject to risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing.”\nIf we are unable to adequately address these risks, they could have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nWe may engage in development, speculative development, or expansion projects or invest in new asset classes, which would subject us to additional risks that could negatively impact our operations.\nWe may engage in development, speculative development, or other expansion projects, which could require us to raise additional capital and obtain additional state and local permits. A decision by any governmental agency not to issue a required permit or substantial delays in the permitting process could cause us to incur penalties, delay us from receiving rental payments or result in us receiving reduced rental payments, or prevent us from pursuing the development, speculative development, or expansion project altogether. Additionally, any such new development, speculative development, or expansion project may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than we expect. The inability to successfully complete development, speculative development, or expansion projects or to complete them on a timely basis could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n15\nWe have recently increased on investments in assets and transaction structures that are outside of our traditional business, including entering into new asset classes, such as casinos and vertical farms, and entering into (or expanding our use of) new transaction structures, such as joint ventures, lending, and increased exploration of sale-leaseback transactions. In addition, in the future, we may invest in new or different assets or enter into new transaction structures that may or may not be closely related to our current business. These new assets and transaction structures may have new, different or increased risks than what we are currently exposed to in our business and we may not be able to manage these risks successfully. Additionally, when investing in such new assets or transaction structures, we will be exposed to the risk that those assets or structures, or the income generated thereby, will affect our ability to meet the requirements to maintain our REIT status, or will subject us to additional regulatory requirements or limitations. If we are not able to successfully manage the risks associated with such new assets, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProperty taxes may increase without notice.\nReal estate property taxes on our properties (including properties we develop or acquire) may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. While the majority of our leases are under a net lease structure, some or all of such property taxes may not be collectible from our clients.\nWe may face extensive regulations from gaming and other regulatory authorities regarding current and future gaming properties.\nAs a landlord of a gaming facility or future gaming facilities, we may be impacted by the risks associated with the gaming industry. The ownership, operation, and management of gaming facilities are subject to pervasive regulation. Gaming authorities also retain great discretion such that gaming regulations can impact our gaming clients, individuals associated with the operation of gaming properties, and us as the owner of the real estate and landlord related to such facilities. Gaming laws and regulations can impact all facets of a gaming property, including but not limited to alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, health care, currency transactions, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted, which could adversely affect our operating results, and may also result in additional taxes or licensing fees imposed on us and our gaming clients. In addition, subject to certain administrative due process requirements, gaming regulators generally have broad authority to conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our officers or certain investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards and suitability to hold a gaming license, and to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke, or suspend any gaming license, registration, or finding of suitability or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered, or found suitable or qualified as a licensee. As a result, our ability to obtain or maintain our required licenses and approvals, or avoid penalties related thereto, may be subject to risks, including risks outside of our control, and cannot be predicted.\nWere a tenant unable to continue to perform under a lease, because of the highly regulated nature of the industry, it may be difficult to re-lease gaming properties. This difficulty may be exacerbated to the extent the gaming property is located in a geography that does not have an expansive gaming footprint, such as one of the properties, in which we are invested. A transfer of interest, including a new lease, will likely require approval of regulators and the licensing of a new gaming operator tenant.\nAn uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.\nOur leases generally require our clients to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, clients are generally required, at the client’s expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. The insurance policies our clients are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily excluded improvements. Our clients are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the client and the industry in which the client operates.\nMany of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by our clients as part of their risk management programs. Additionally, we have obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the\n16\nclients fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss. We do not carry insurance for certain losses and certain types of losses may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. However, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. We also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies, and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire.\nIn addition, although we obtain title insurance policies on our properties to help protect us and our properties against title defects (such as adverse claims of ownership, liens or other encumbrances), there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover. If a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property, cause a financial misstatement or damage our reputation.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur properties are generally required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities,” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants. The clients to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions and, in many cases, the clients are generally obligated to cover costs associated with compliance pursuant to the terms of their applicable leases. If required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these clients to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our properties must be in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with climate change and our sustainability strategies.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with the effects of climate change, and a resulting shift to a lower carbon economy, and may be subject to further risks in the future. Climate change could adversely affect our business through both chronic and acute perils including, but not limited to, extreme weather, changes in precipitation and temperature, and rising sea levels, all of which may result in physical damage to, or a decrease in demand for, our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions, and may adversely impact consumer behaviors, preferences and spending for our clients, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations under our leases, or our ability to re-lease the properties in the future. In addition, should the impact of climate change be severe or occur for lengthy periods of time, connectivity, labor and supply chains could impact business continuity for ourselves and our clients. Chronic climate change may lead to increased costs for us and our clients to adapt to the demands and expectations of climate change or lower carbon usage, including with respect to heating, cooling or electricity costs, retrofitting properties to be more energy efficient or comply with new rules or regulations, or other unforeseen costs. These risks could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe seek to promote effective energy efficiency and other sustainability strategies and compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations related to climate change, both internally and with our clients. Our sustainability strategies and efforts to comply with changes in federal, state and international laws and regulations on climate change could result in significant capital expenditures to improve our existing properties or properties we may acquire. Any changes to such laws and regulations could also result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures at our properties. If we are unable to comply with laws and regulations on climate change or implement effective sustainability strategies, our reputation among our clients and investors may be damaged and we may incur fines and/or penalties. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any of our sustainability strategies\n17\nwill result in reduced operating costs, higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter our existing clients from relocating to properties owned by our competitors.\nIn addition, tenants of net-leased properties are responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of the properties. This lack of control over our net-leased properties makes it difficult for us to collect property-level environmental metrics and to enforce sustainability initiatives, which may impact our ability to comply with certain regulatory disclosure requirements to which we are subject (such as the anticipated changes to the SEC’s climate-related disclosure rules) or comply effectively with established Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") frameworks and standards, such as the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarks, Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. If we are unable to successfully collect the data necessary to comply with these disclosure requirements, we may be subject to increased regulatory risk and if such data is incomplete or unfavorable, our relationship with our investors, our stock price, and our access to capital may be negatively impacted.\nOur charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock.\nOur charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to, among other purposes, assist us in maintaining our status as a REIT for U.S. federal and/or state income tax purposes. For example, our charter restricts any person from acquiring beneficial or constructive ownership of more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock. These restrictions could have anti-takeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe value of certain of our investment in real property may be reduced as the result of the expiration or loss of local tax abatements, tax credit programs, or other governmental incentives.\nCertain of our investments have the benefit of governmental tax incentives aimed at inducing property users to relocate to incentivize development in areas and neighborhoods which have not historically seen robust commercial development. These incentives typically have specific sunset provisions and may be subject to governmental discretion in the eligibility or award of the applicable incentives. The expiration of these incentive programs or the inability of potential clients or users to be eligible for or to obtain governmental approval of the incentives, or the inability to remain compliant with such programs, may have an adverse effect on the value of our investment, cash flow and net income, and may result in impairment charges.\nRisks Related to the Spirit Merger and Transactions Contemplated by the Merger Agreement\nFollowing the Merger, we may be unable to integrate the operations of Spirit successfully, or realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or do so within the anticipated time frame.\nThe Merger involves the combination of two companies which operated as independent public companies. We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the operations of Spirit. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n•\nthe inability to successfully combine Spirit’s operations with ours in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve operating efficiencies (including with the integration of information technology systems), cost savings and efficiencies, revenues, synergies or other benefits either in the time frame anticipated or at all;\n•\nlost revenue and clients as a result of certain clients of either us or Spirit deciding not to do business with the combined company;\n•\nthe continued complexities associated with managing a multi-national combined company, integrating certain personnel from the two companies, and the complexities associated with the separation of personnel;\n•\nthe complexities of combining two companies with different histories, regulatory restrictions, markets and clients;\n•\nthe failure to retain key employees of either of the two companies;\n•\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 29, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Saints MD Subsidiary, Inc., a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Spirit; and\n•\nperformance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the Merger and integrating Spirit's operations with ours.\nIn addition, as disclosed, certain legal proceedings were instituted against us, Spirit, and the former Spirit directors and we may see additional legal proceedings instituted in the future. The pendency and outcome of any legal proceedings is uncertain and may result in additional costs, expenses and the diversion of management’s attention\n18\nall of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and price of our common stock or our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur historical and unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements may not be representative of our results after the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were completed in January 2024. Accordingly, our historical financial statements and our operating results for the periods prior to such time do not give effect to those transactions. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements related to such transactions that we have previously prepared were created for informational purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the financial position or results of operations that actually would have occurred had the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement been completed as of the dates indicated, nor does it purport to be indicative of our future operating results or financial position after the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments, which were based upon preliminary estimates, to allocate the purchase price to Spirit’s assets and liabilities and certain estimates and assumptions regarding the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that we and Spirit believe are reasonable under the circumstances. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect other future events that occur after the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the costs related to the planned integration of the two companies and any future nonrecurring charges resulting from the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and do not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or expense efficiencies. As a result, we cannot assure you that our historical and unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements will be representative of our results for future periods.\nOur common stockholders will be diluted by the Merger.\nAt the closing of the Merger, we issued approximately 108.0 million additional shares of common stock. Consequently, as a result of this dilution, our common stockholders as of immediately prior to the Merger have less voting control and influence over our management and policies after the effective time of the Merger than they previously exercised over our management and policies.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors,\nwhich may change from time to time and may be outside of our control, including:\n•\nPrevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities;\n•\nThe market for similar securities issued by other REITs;\n•\nGeneral economic, political and financial market conditions;\n•\nThe financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our clients and our competitors;\n•\nChanges in legal and regulatory taxation obligations;\n•\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings;\n•\nChanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry;\n•\nChanges in our credit ratings;\n•\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors; and\n•\nFailure to achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or if the effect of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on our results of operations or financial condition is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nIn addition, over the last several years, prices of common stock and debt securities in the U.S., trading markets have experienced extreme price fluctuations, and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period. As a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\n19\nLitigation risks could affect our business.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims including those that may arise out of mergers and acquisitions, acquisitions, development opportunities, dispositions, joint ventures, and other strategic transactions. An unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. It is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry or retain employees to the same extent as in the past.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events (e.g., pandemics or epidemics) may negatively affect our operations, the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our clients, our business or the U.S. or world generally. If events like these were to occur, they could materially interrupt our business operations, cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the U.S. or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities. It could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.\nWe, like all businesses, are subject to cyber-attacks and security incidents, which threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and information resources. Cyber-attacks are malicious cyber activity and a security incident is a successful cyber-attack that has the potential to expose sensitive data, internal systems, or otherwise disrupt business operations. Those attacks and incidents may be due to intentional or unintentional acts by employees, contractors or third-parties, who seek to gain unauthorized access to our or our service providers’ systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information through malware, computer viruses, ransomware, social engineering (e.g., phishing attachments to e-mails) or other vectors.\nThe risk of a cybersecurity breach or operational disruption, particularly through a cyber incident, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased, particularly as remote working has become more common. Our information technology (“IT”) networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our clients. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption (such as the implementation of systems and/or vendors that provide constant monitoring of our IT networks and related systems for cyber-attacks and incidents); however, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.\nWhile we maintain some of our own critical IT networks and related systems, we depend on third-parties to provide important software, technologies, tools and a broad array of services and functions, such as payroll, human resources, electronic communications, data storage, and certain finance and treasury functions, among others. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process, transmit and store sensitive data, within our own systems and utilize those of third-party providers, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our clients, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information.\n20\nOur measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats may not be successful in preventing a security incident or data breach or limiting the effects of such a breach. This is particularly so because attack methodologies change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and we also may be unable to investigate or remediate incidents because attackers are increasingly using techniques and tools designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. Our clients, joint venture partners, or other third parties with whom we do business may themselves become subject to cyberattacks or security incidents, over which we may have no control, and which could have an indirect adverse impact on them, us or our business relationship.\nThe primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyberattack or security incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our clients, reputational damage, and private data exposure. We could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address an attack or incident, which may not be covered or fully covered by our insurance and which may involve payments for investigations, forensic analyses, legal advice, public relations advice, system repair or replacement, or other services, in addition to any remedies or relief that may result from legal proceedings. Our financial results may be negatively impacted by any such attacks and incidents or any resulting negative media attention. Further, while we carry cyber liability insurance, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses related to such events.\nVolatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements.\nVarious estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments), and receivables. Often these estimates require the use of market data values and involve estimates of future performance or receivables collectability all of which can be difficult to accurately predict. Although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates, it is possible actual results may differ from these estimates.\nInherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements, disclosure controls and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement and disclosure accuracy and safeguarding of assets. Failures in our internal controls could result in adverse consequences in our financial reporting and operations, including delays, additional costs, impairment in our ability to access capital, adverse impacts to investor confidence, regulatory review, or litigation.\nOur business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness, and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot make any assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us, the market price of our common stock, and may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital.\nHistorically, there have been periods where the global equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of equity and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions. A prolonged downturn in the equity or credit markets may cause us to refinance at higher rates, seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to buy or sell properties, may adversely affect the price we purchase or receive for properties, as we and prospective buyers may\n21\nexperience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing. These events in the equity and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. These disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and debt securities, the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties, as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general.\nInflation (including prolonged inflationary periods) may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIncreased inflation or anticipated inflationary periods, such as the period in which we are currently in, could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation and other costs (including increases in employment and other fees and expenses). Government regulations may limit the indices we can utilize in lease adjustments thereby limiting our ability to increase rent. Even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our clients’ ability to pay rent. The U.K. government plans to migrate away from the Retail Price Index (\"RPI\"), to alternatives such as the Consumer Price Index including owner occupiers' housing costs, that may result in a lower measure of inflation and, in turn, have a negative impact on our lease revenue currently tied to RPI in the U.K. Inflationary periods may cause us to experience increased costs of financing, making it difficult to incur or refinance debt at attractive rates or at all, and may adversely affect the properties we can acquire if the cost of financing an acquisition is in excess of our anticipated earnings from such property thereby limiting the properties that can be acquired. To the extent periods of high inflation are prolonged, these results may be exacerbated."

For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, please refer to Part II, Item 7. \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022.\nGENERAL\nRealty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company\n®\n, is an S&P 500 company and member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats\n®\nindex for having increased its dividend every year for over 25 consecutive years. We invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. We are structured as a REIT requiring us annually to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains) in the form of dividends to our stockholders. The monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow generated from real estate owned under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned or held interests in a diversified portfolio of 13,458 properties located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the U.K., France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, with approximately 272.1 million square feet of leasable space to clients doing business in 86 separate industries. Of the 13,458 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2023, 13,197, or 98.1%, are single-client properties, of which 13,007 were leased, and the remaining are multi-client properties. Our total portfolio has a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of our client) of approximately 9.8 years.\nUnless otherwise specified, references to rental revenue in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are exclusive of reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses totaling $274.2 million, $184.7 million and $104.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nClosing of Spirit Realty Capital Merger\nOn January 23, 2024, we closed on our previously announced merger with Spirit, which is further described in note\n21,\nSubsequent Events,\nto the consolidated financial statements. The Spirit portfolio consisted of 2,018 U.S. retail, industrial and other properties across 49 states. With assets that are highly complementary to our existing portfolio, this transaction enhances the diversification and depth of our real estate portfolio and will allow us to strengthen our longstanding relationships with existing clients and curate new ones.\nIncreases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders\nWe have continued our 55-year history of paying monthly dividends. In addition, we increased the dividend five times during 2023 and once\nduring 2024. As of February 2024, we have paid 105 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 123 times since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.\nThe dividends paid per share during 2023 totaled $3.051, as compared to $2.967 during 2022, an increase of $0.084, or 2.8%.\n25\nThe monthly dividend of $0.2565 per share represents a current annualized dividend of $3.0780 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of 5.4% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $57.42 on December 31, 2023. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period.\nInvestments During 2023\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we invested $9.5 billion at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.1%, including an investment in 1,408 properties, properties under development or expansion, investments in loans and a preferred equity investment.\nSee notes\n4\n,\nInvestments in Real Estate, 5, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities,\nand\n6, Investments in Loans,\nto the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nEquity Capital Raising\nWe have an At-The-Market (\"ATM\") program, pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to 120.0 million shares of common stock (1) by us to, or through, a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents or (2) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers contemplated thereunder, in each case by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE at prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices or by any other methods permitted by applicable law.\nDuring 2023, we raised $5.5 billion\nof net proceeds from the sale of common stock, at a weighted average price of $59.79 per share, primarily through proceeds from the sale of common stock through our At-the-Market (\"ATM\") Program. The ATM program issuances during 2023 included\n91.7 million\nshares issued pursuant to forward sale confirmations. As of December 31, 2023, 6.2 million shares of common stock subject to forward sale confirmations have been executed but not settled. See note\n11\n,\nIssuances of Common Stock\n, to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nNote Issuances\nIn January 2024, we issued $450.0 million of 4.750%\nsenior unsecured notes due February 2029 and $800.0 million of\n5.125%\nsenior unsecured notes due February 2034. In connection with the Merger, we also completed the $2.7 billion exchange in principal of outstanding notes issued by Spirit Realty, L.P. (“Spirit OP”). See note\n21, Subsequent Events,\nto the consolidated financial statements\nfor further details.\nIn December 2023, we issued £300.0 million of 5.750% senior unsecured notes due December 2031 and £450.0 million of 6.000% senior unsecured notes due December 2039.\nIn July 2023, we issued €550.0 million of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due July 2030 and €550.0 million of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due July 2034.\nIn April 2023, we issued $400.0 million of 4.700% senior unsecured notes due December 2028 and $600.0 million of 4.900% senior unsecured notes due July 2033.\nIn January 2023, we issued $500.0 million of 5.050% senior unsecured notes due January 2026 and $600.0 million of 4.850% senior unsecured notes due March 2030.\nSee note\n10\n.\nNotes Payable\n, to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nAppointment of New Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (\"CFO\")\nEffective January 1, 2024, Jonathan Pong was appointed Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, replacing Christie Kelly, our former CFO, upon her planned retirement that was announced in June 2023.\n26\nPortfolio Discussion\nLeasing Results\nAt December 31, 2023, we had 193 properties available for lease or sale out of 13,458 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 98.6% occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio. Our property-level occupancy rates exclude properties with ancillary leases only, such as cell towers and billboards, properties with possession pending, and include properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures.\nBelow is a summary of our portfolio activity for the periods indicated below:\n(1)\nIncludes scheduled and unscheduled expirations (including leases rejected in bankruptcy), as well as future expirations resolved in the periods indicated above.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, the new annualized contractual rent on re-leases was $52.7 million, as compared to the previous annual rent of $50.8 million on the same units, representing a rent recapture rate of 103.6% on the units re-leased, which excludes restructurings associated with the Cineworld bankruptcy. Including Cineworld restructured leases that resulted in lease extensions, the recapture rate was 94.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2023. We re-leased 20 units to new clients without a period of vacancy, and 12 units to new clients after a period of vacancy.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the new annualized contractual rent on re-leases was $198.1 million, as compared to the previous annual rent of $190.3 million on the same units, representing a rent recapture rate of 104.1% on the units re-leased, which excludes restructurings associated with the Cineworld bankruptcy. Including Cineworld restructured leases that resulted in lease extensions, the recapture rate was 101.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023. We re-leased 27 units to new clients without a period of vacancy, and 39 units to new clients after a period of vacancy.\nAs part of our re-leasing costs, we pay leasing commissions to unrelated, third-party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard, and sometimes provide rent concessions to our clients. We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or rent concessions to our clients to be material to our financial position or results of operations.\nPan European Sale and Leaseback with\nDecathlon SE (\"Decathlon\")\nWe entered the markets of France, Germany, and Portugal for the first time through sale-leaseback transactions with affiliates of Decathlon, a world leader in retail sporting goods and an investment grade rated company, for €527.0 million, which includes 82 retail properties located in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated\nJoint Ventures\nIn October 2023, we completed our previously announced $951.4 million acquisition of common and preferred interests from Blackstone Real Estate Trust, Inc. (\"BREIT\") in a new joint venture that owns a 95% interest in the real estate of The Bellagio Las Vegas. The investment included $301.4 million of common equity in the joint venture in exchange for an indirect interest of 21.9% in the property and a $650.0 million preferred equity interest in the joint venture with an expected rate of return of 8.1%.\n27\nIn November 2023, we established a joint venture with Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (\"Digital Realty\") to support the development of two build-to-suit data centers in Northern Virginia. We invested approximately $199.8 million to acquire an 80% equity interest in the venture, while Digital Realty maintains a 20% interest. Each partner will fund its pro rata share of the remaining $117.7 million estimated development cost for the first phase of the project, which is slated for completion in mid-2024.\nSee note\n5, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities,\nto the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nImpact of\nInflation\nLeases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the consumer price index, or retail price index in the case of certain leases in the U.K. (typically subject to ceilings), or increases in the clients’ sales volumes. We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation and other costs.\nMoreover, our strategic focus on the use of net lease agreements reduces our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the client is responsible for property expenses. Even though the utilization of net leases reduces our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our clients' ability to pay rent. Additionally, inflationary periods may cause us to experience increased costs of financing, make it difficult to refinance debt at attractive rates or at all, and may adversely affect the properties we can acquire if the cost of financing an acquisition is in excess of our anticipated earnings from such property, thereby limiting the properties that can be acquired.\nImpact of Real Estate and Credit Markets\nIn the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the global capital markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and global capital markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $4.1 billion of liquidity, which consists of cash and cash equivalents of $232.9 million, including £46.1 million denominated in Sterling and €43.6 million denominated in Euro, unsettled ATM forward equity of $337.8 million, and $3.5 billion of availability under our $4.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, after deducting $764.4 million in borrowings under our commercial paper programs. We use our unsecured revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of the notes issued under these programs.\nOur primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the “Material Cash Requirements” table, which is presented later in this section. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs, and cash distributions to common stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, short-term term loans, and under our commercial paper programs, and through public securities offerings.\nWe expect to fund the next twelve months of obligations through a combination of the following:\n•\nCash and cash equivalents;\n•\nFuture cash flows from operations;\n•\nIssuances of common stock or debt; and\n•\nAdditional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan (after deducting outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs).\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. We intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility and commercial paper programs.\n28\nLong-Term Liquidity Requirements\nOur goal is to deliver dependable monthly dividends to our stockholders that increase over time. Historically, we have met our principal short-term and long-term capital needs, including the funding of high-quality real estate acquisitions, investments in loans, property development, and capital expenditures by issuing common stock, preferred stock, long-term unsecured notes, and term loan borrowings. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. We may issue common stock when we believe our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of an offering to be accretively invested into additional properties or to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, or shorter-term debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us.\nCapitalization\nAs of December 31, 2023, our total market capitalization was $65.4 billion. Total market capitalization consisted of $43.3 billion of common equity (based on the December 31, 2023 closing price on the NYSE of $57.42 and assuming the conversion of common units of Realty Income, L.P.) and total outstanding borrowings of $22.1 billion on our revolving credit facility, commercial paper, term loans, mortgages payable, senior unsecured notes and bonds, and our proportionate share of unconsolidated entities' debt (excluding unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts, and premiums). Our total debt to market capitalization was 33.8% at December 31, 2023.\nUniversal Shelf Registration\nOn February 16, 2024, we filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in February 2027. In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.\nATM Program\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 6.2 million shares of unsettled common stock subject to forward sale confirmations through our ATM program, representing approximately $337.8 million in expected net proceeds, which have been executed at a weighted average price of $54.70 per share (assuming full physical settlement of all outstanding shares of common stock, subject to such forward sale agreements and certain assumptions made with respect to settlement dates). During the year ended December 31, 2023, we settled approximately 91.7 million shares of common stock previously sold pursuant to forward sale agreements through our ATM program for approximately $5.4 billion of net proceeds. As of December 31, 2023, we had 81.3 million\nshares remaining for future issuance under our ATM program. We anticipate maintaining the availability of our ATM program in the future, including the replenishment of authorized shares issuable thereunder.\nDebt and Financing Activities\nAt December 31, 2023, our total outstanding borrowings of revolving credit facility, commercial paper, term loans, mortgages payable, and senior unsecured notes and bonds were $21.5 billion, with a weighted average maturity of 5.9 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 94% of our total debt was fixed rate debt. See notes 7 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our outstanding debt, along with our debt financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 below.\n29\nNote Issuances\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued the following notes and bonds (in millions):\nIn January 2024, we issued $450.0 million of 4.750%\nsenior unsecured notes due February 2029 and $800.0 million of\n5.125%\nsenior unsecured notes due February 2034\n.\nIn connection with the Merger, we also completed the $2.7 billion exchange in principal of outstanding notes issued by Spirit OP.\nSee note\n21, Subsequent Events,\nto the consolidated financial statements\nfor further details.\nTerm Loans\nIn January 2023, we entered into a term loan agreement, permitting us to incur multicurrency term loans, up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion in total borrowings. As of December 31, 2023, we had $1.1 billion in multicurrency borrowings, including $90.0 million, £705.0 million, and €85.0 million in outstanding borrowings. The 2023 term loans mature in January 2025 with one remaining 12-month maturity extension available at our option. In conjunction with our 2023 term loans, we entered into interest rate swaps which fix our per annum interest rate. As of December 31, 2023, the effective interest rate, after giving effect to the interest rate swaps, was 5.0%.\nCovenants\nThe following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds. These calculations, which are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in U.S. GAAP, are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance. The actual amounts as of December 31, 2023, are:\n(1)\nOur debt service coverage ratio is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding four-quarter period on the assumptions that: (i) the incurrence of any debt (as defined in the covenants) incurred by us since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to refinance other debt since the first day of such four-quarter period), (ii) the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such four-quarter period, and (iii) any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on January 1, 2023 and subject to certain additional adjustments. Such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant, reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties, and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence occurred as of January 1, 2023, nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period. The following is our calculation of debt service and fixed charge coverage at December 31, 2023 (in thousands, for trailing twelve months):\n30\nCredit Agency Ratings\nThe borrowing interest rates under our revolving credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2023, we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds: Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of A3 with a “stable” outlook and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A- with a “stable” outlook. In addition, we were assigned the following ratings on our commercial paper at December 31, 2023: Moody's Investors Service has assigned a rating of P-2 and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A-2.\nBased on our credit agency ratings as of December 31, 2023, interest rates under our credit facility for U.S. borrowings would have been at the SOFR, plus 0.725% with a SOFR adjustment charge of 0.10% and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.95% over SOFR, for British Pound Sterling borrowings, at the SONIA, plus 0.725% with a SONIA adjustment charge of 0.0326% and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.8826% over SONIA, and for Euro Borrowings at one-month EURIBOR, plus 0.725%, and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.85% over one-month EURIBOR. In addition, our credit facility provides that the interest rates can range between: (i) SOFR/SONIA/EURIBOR, plus 1.40% if our credit rating is lower than BBB-/Baa3 or our senior unsecured debt is unrated and (ii) SOFR/SONIA/EURIBOR, plus 0.70% if our credit rating is A/A2 or higher. In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which ranges from: (i) 0.30% for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated, and (ii) 0.10% for a credit rating of A/A2 or higher.\nWe also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions. If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease. The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions):\n(1)\nThe initial term of the credit facility expires in June 2026 and includes, at our option, two six-month extensions. At December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and commercial paper programs outstanding were $764.4 million, which matured between January 2024 and February 2024.\n(2)\nThe maturity date for our 2023 term loans reflects the closing of our previous twelve-month extension option and assumes the additional twelve-month extension available at the company's option is exercised.\n(3)\nExcludes our January 2024 issuance of $450.0 million of 4.750% senior unsecured notes due February 2029 and $800.0 million of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due February 2034.\n(4)\nInterest on the commercial paper programs, term loans, mortgages payable, and senior unsecured notes and bonds has been calculated based on outstanding balances at period end through their respective maturity dates. Excludes interest on the January 2024 issuances of $450.0 million of unsecured senior notes due February 2029 and $800.0 million of unsecured senior notes due February 2034.\n(5)\nWe currently pay the ground lessors directly for the rent under the ground leases.\n(6)\nOur clients, who are generally sub-tenants clients under ground leases, are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases. In the event our client fails to pay the ground lease rent, we are primarily responsible.\n(7)\n“Other” consists of $740.0 million of commitments under construction contracts, and $32.7 million for re-leasing costs, recurring capital expenditures, and non-recurring building improvements.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nAs of December 31, 2023, our pro-rata share of secured debt of unconsolidated entities was approximately $659.2 million.\n31\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nDistributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock.\nDistributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of Realty Income, L.P., each on a per unit basis that is equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders.\nIn order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2023, our cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $2.11 billion, or approximately 115.9% of estimated taxable income of $1.82 billion. Certain measures are available to us to reduce or eliminate our tax exposure as a REIT, and accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes, other than our taxable REIT subsidiaries (each, a \"TRS\"), has been made. Our estimated taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our cash on hand and funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. We distributed $3.051 per share to stockholders during 2023, representing 76.3% of our diluted Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"AFFO\") per share of $4.00.\nFuture distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"FFO\"), Normalized Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"Normalized FFO\"), AFFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our debt service requirements, and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility.\nDistributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20%. In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT’s stock and the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations (such as our TRSs) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year). However, non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, generally may deduct up to 20% of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026.\nDistributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset. Approximately 6.8% of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2023, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes.\n32\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nTotal Revenue\nThe following summarizes our total revenue (dollars in thousands):\nRental Revenue (excluding reimbursable)\nThe table below summarizes our rental revenue (excluding reimbursable) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nThe same store rental revenue percentage increase for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 is 1.9%.\n(2)\nFor purposes of comparability, same store rental revenue is presented on a constant currency basis using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2023. None of the properties in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, or Portugal met our same store pool definition for the periods presented.\n(3)\nRelates to the aggregate of (i) rental revenue from 325 properties that were available for lease during part of 2023 or 2022, and (ii) rental revenue for 27 properties under development or completed developments that do not meet our same store pool definition for the periods presented.\n(4)\nPrimarily consists of reimbursements for tenant improvements and rental revenue that is not contractual base rent such as lease termination.\nFor purposes of determining the same store rent property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entire year-to-date period, for both the current and prior year, except for properties during the current or prior year that; (i) were vacant at any time, (ii) were under development or redevelopment, or (iii) were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced. Each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above, explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period.\nOf the 14,262 in-place leases in the portfolio, which excludes 270 vacant units, 11,717, or 82.2%, were under leases that provide for increases in rents through: base rent increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), percentage rent based on a percentage of the clients’ gross sales, fixed increases, or a combination of two or more of the aforementioned rent provisions.\nRent based on a percentage of our client's gross sales, or percentage rent, was $14.8 million and $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which represents less than 1% of rental revenue.\nAt December 31, 2023, our portfolio of 13,458 properties was 98.6% leased with 193 properties available for lease, as compared to 99.0% leased with 126 properties available for lease at December 31, 2022. It has been our experience that approximately 1% to 4% of our property portfolio will be available for lease at any given time; however, it is possible that the number of properties available for lease or sale could increase in the future, given the nature of economic cycles and other unforeseen global events.\n33\nRental Revenue (reimbursable)\nA number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses. The increase in contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022 is primarily due to higher recoverable real estate tax taxes from overall portfolio growth.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue primarily relates to interest income recognized on financing receivables for certain leases with above-market terms and interest income recognized on client loans and preferred equity investments. The increase in other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022 is primarily due to higher interest income on financing receivables of $60.9 million driven by an increase in recent sale-leaseback transactions with above-market lease terms, in addition to an increase of $17.0 million from interest income earned on new loans and preferred equity investments entered into during the year.\nTotal Expenses\nThe following summarizes our total expenses (in thousands):\n(1)\nExcludes rental revenue (reimbursable).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022 is primarily due to overall portfolio growth from acquisitions.\nInterest Expense\nThe following is a summary of the components of our interest expense (in thousands):\n34\nThe increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022 is primarily due to higher average debt and weighted average interest. See notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our indebtedness.\nProperty Expenses (excluding reimbursable)\nProperty expenses (excluding reimbursable) consist of costs associated with properties available for lease, non-net-leased properties and general portfolio expenses and include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections and legal fees.\nThe increase in property expenses (excluding reimbursable) for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022 is primarily impacted by property tax and property management expenses.\nProperty Expenses (reimbursable)\nProperty expenses (reimbursable) consist of reimbursable property taxes and operating costs paid on behalf of our clients. The increase in property expenses (reimbursable) for the year ended December 31, 2023 is proportional to overall portfolio growth.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are expenditures related to the operations of our company, including employee-related costs, professional fees, and other general overhead costs associated with running our business.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022 is primarily due to higher payroll-related compensation costs associated with the growth of the company.\nProvisions for Impairment\nProvisions for impairment consist of impairment on long-lived assets and allowances for credit losses on financing receivables and loans.\nThe increase in impairment for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022 is primarily due to higher provisions for impairment associated with our real estate assets, summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\n(1)\nExcludes provision for current expected credit loss of $4.9 million at December 31, 2023.\nMerger and Integration-Related Costs\nMerger and integration-related costs consist of advisory fees, attorney fees, accountant fees, and incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data and systems, retain employees, and otherwise enable us to operate the acquired business or assets efficiently.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $14.5 million of merger and integration-related costs, the majority of which was related to the Spirit merger that closed in January 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $13.9 million of merger and integration-related transaction costs in conjunction with our VEREIT merger.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\nThe following summarizes our property dispositions (dollars in millions):\n35\nForeign Currency and Derivative (Loss) Gain, Net\nWe borrow in the functional currencies of the countries in which we invest. Net foreign currency gain and loss are primarily related to the remeasurement of intercompany debt from foreign subsidiaries.\nDerivative gain and loss primarily relates to mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and settlement of designated derivatives reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"AOCI\").\nForeign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net for the year ended December 31, 2023 was a loss of $13.4 million, primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations related to the remeasurement of intercompany debt.\nIn June 2022, following the early prepayment of our Sterling-denominated intercompany loan receivable from our consolidated foreign subsidiaries, we terminated the four cross-currency swaps used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the intercompany loan.\nAs the hedge relationship was terminated and the future principal and interest associated with the prepaid intercompany loan will not occur, $20.0 million gain was reclassified from AOCI to 'Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net' during the year ended December 31, 2022. The reclassification from AOCI was offset by $7.9 million in losses from the intercompany loan remeasurement on the final exchange.\nEquity in Income and Impairment of Investment in Unconsolidated Entities\nEquity in income for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily relates to investments made in two unconsolidated joint ventures during the fourth quarter of 2023. See note 5,\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\n, to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nThe loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by an other than temporary impairment related to the sale of three equity method investments acquired in our merger with VEREIT in November 2021.\nOther Income, Net\nCertain miscellaneous non-recurring revenue is included in 'other income, net'. The decrease of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022 is primarily due to lower gains on insurance proceeds from recoveries on property losses exceeding our carrying value.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes primarily consist of international income taxes accrued or paid by us and our subsidiaries, as well as state and local taxes. The increase in income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022 is primarily attributable to higher taxable income in the UK; partially offset by lower UK tax rates.\n36\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note\n1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by U.S. GAAP, many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies.\nAllocation of the Purchase Price of Real Estate Acquisitions\nManagement must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When acquiring a property for investment purposes, we typically allocate the cost of real estate acquired, inclusive of transaction costs, to: (1) land, (2) building and improvements, and (3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their relative estimated fair values. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market or below-market lease value and the value of in-place leases, as applicable. Additionally, above-market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as financing receivables amortizing over the lease term, while below-market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as prepaid rent. In an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value of the land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities and is often based upon the various characteristics of the market where the property is located. In addition, any assumed mortgages are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors, such as industry type, client investment grade, maturity date, and comparable borrowings for similar assets. The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses.\nProvisions for Impairment - Real Estate Assets\nAnother significant judgment must be made as to if, and when, impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property, a fair value analysis is performed and, to the extent the estimated fair value is less than the current book value, a provision for impairment is recorded to reduce the book value to estimated fair value. Key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures, and property sales capitalization rates. If a property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell. The carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets. Our strategy of primarily holding properties, long-term, directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable, thus requiring the recognition of an impairment. However, if our strategy, or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future, an impairment may need to be recognized. If events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment, they could have a material impact on our results of operations.\n37\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (\"Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n\")\nNareit established an EBITDA metric for real estate companies (i.e., EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDA\nre\n) it believed would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among REITs. Our definition of “Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n” is generally consistent with the Nareit definition, other than our adjustments to remove foreign currency and derivative gain and loss, excluding gain and loss from the settlement of foreign currency forwards not designated as hedges (which is consistent with our previous calculations of \"Adjusted EBITDA\"). We define Adjusted EBITDAre, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent quarter as earnings (net income) before (i) interest expense, including non-cash loss (gain) on swaps, (ii) income and franchise taxes, (iii) gain on extinguishment of debt, (iv) real estate depreciation and amortization, (v) provisions for impairment, (vi) merger and integration-related costs, (vii) gain on sales of real estate, (viii) foreign currency and derivative gain and loss, net, (ix) gain on settlement of foreign currency forwards, and (x) our proportionate share of adjustments from unconsolidated entities. Our Adjusted EBITDAre may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDAre reported by other companies or as defined by Nareit, and other companies may interpret or define Adjusted EBITDA\nre\ndifferently than we do. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nto be a meaningful measure of a REIT’s performance because it provides a view of our operating performance, analyzes our ability to meet interest payment obligations before the effects of income tax, depreciation and amortization expense, provisions for impairment, gain on sales of real estate and other items, as defined above, that affect comparability, including the removal of non-recurring and non-cash items that industry observers believe are less relevant to evaluating the operating performance of a company. In addition, EBITDA\nre\nis widely followed by industry analysts, lenders, investors, rating agencies, and others as a means of evaluating the operational cash generating capacity of a company prior to servicing debt obligations. Management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nmetric, which we refer to as Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, is meaningful because it represents our current earnings run rate for the period presented. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nand Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, as defined below, are also used to determine the vesting of performance share awards granted to executive officers. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nshould be considered along with, but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance. We define Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nas Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, subject to certain adjustments to incorporate Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nfrom properties we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and to remove Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nfrom properties we disposed of during the applicable quarter, and include transaction accounting adjustments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period. Our calculation includes all adjustments consistent with the requirements to present Adjusted EBITDA\nre\non a pro forma basis in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The Annualized Pro Forma Adjustments are consistent with the debt service coverage ratio calculated under financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes. We believe Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nis a useful non-GAAP supplemental measure, as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter. Management also uses our ratios of net debt-to-Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nand net debt-to Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nas measures of leverage in assessing our financial performance, which is calculated as net debt (which we define as total debt per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts, but including our proportionate share of debt from unconsolidated entities, less cash and cash equivalents), divided by annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nand annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, respectively.\n38\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nand\nAnnualized Pro Forma EBITDA\nre\ncalculations for the periods indicated below (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nWe calculate Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nby multiplying the Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nby four.\n(2)\nNet Debt is total debt per our consolidated balance sheets, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts, but including our proportionate share of debt from unconsolidated entities, less cash and cash equivalents.\nAs described above, the Annualized Pro Forma Adjustments, which include transaction accounting adjustments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, consist of adjustments to incorporate the Adjusted EBITDAre from properties we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and remove Adjusted EBITDAre from properties we disposed of during the applicable quarter, giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the period, consistent with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The following table summarizes our Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAre calculation for the period indicated below (dollars in thousands):\n39\nFUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (\"FFO\") AND NORMALIZED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (\"Normalized FFO\")\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus provisions for impairments of depreciable real estate assets, and reduced by gain on property sales. We define Normalized FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, as FFO excluding merger and integration-related costs related to our merger with VEREIT. We define diluted FFO and diluted normalized FFO as FFO and normalized FFO adjusted for dilutive noncontrolling interests.\nThe following summarizes our FFO and Normalized FFO (dollars in millions, except per share data):\n(1)\nAll per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis.\n40\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to FFO and Normalized FFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):\n(1)\nIncludes an other than temporary impairment of $8.5 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 on our investment in unconsolidated entities, all of which were sold as of December 31, 2022.\nWe consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of a REIT’s operating performance as they are based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for FFO, and adds back merger and integration-related costs, for Normalized FFO. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative.\n41\nADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (\"AFFO\")\nWe define AFFO, a non-GAAP measure, as FFO adjusted for unique revenue and expense items, which we believe are not as pertinent to the measurement of our ongoing operating performance. We define diluted AFFO as AFFO adjusted for dilutive noncontrolling interests.\nThe following summarizes our AFFO (dollars in millions, except per share data):\n(1)\nAll per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis.\nWe consider AFFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance. Most companies in our industry use a similar measurement, but they may use the term “CAD” (for Cash Available for Distribution), “FAD” (for Funds Available for Distribution) or other terms. Our AFFO calculations may not be comparable to AFFO, CAD or FAD reported by other companies, and other companies may interpret or define such terms differently than we do.\n42\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to Normalized FFO and AFFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):\n(1)\nSee reconciling items for Normalized FFO presented under “Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"FFO\") and Normalized Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"Normalized FFO\")\".\n(2)\nIncludes the amortization of net premiums on notes payable and assumption of our mortgages payable, which are being amortized over the life of the applicable debt, and costs incurred and capitalized upon issuance and exchange of our notes payable, assumption of our mortgages payable and issuance of our term loans, which are also being amortized over the lives of the applicable debt. No costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included.\n(3)\nRepresents the straight-line amortization of $72.0 million gain realized upon the termination of $500.0 million in notional interest rate swaps in October 2022, over the term of the $750.0 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due October 2032.\n(4)\nIncludes non-cash foreign currency losses (gains) from remeasurement to USD, mark-to-market adjustments on investments and derivatives that are non-cash in nature, straight-line payments from cross-currency swaps, obligations related to financing lease liabilities, and adjustments allocable to noncontrolling interests.\nWe believe the non-GAAP financial measure AFFO provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies. In particular, AFFO provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different REITs without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s on-going operating performance. Therefore, we believe that AFFO is an appropriate supplemental performance metric, and that the most appropriate U.S. GAAP performance metric to which AFFO should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders.\n43\nPresentation of the information regarding FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO in the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance. FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. In addition, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO should not be considered as measures of liquidity, our ability to make cash distributions, or our ability to pay interest payments."

    "text": "We are exposed to economic risks from interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. A portion of these risks is hedged, but the risks may affect our financial statements.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and commercial paper programs, term loans, mortgages payable, and long-term notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we issue long-term notes and bonds, primarily at fixed rates.\nIn order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate locks and caps. The use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks, including counterparty credit risk, the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract. To limit counterparty credit risk, we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities. We do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.\nThe following table presents, by year of expected maturity, the principal amounts, average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2023. This information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes (dollars in millions):\nExpected Maturity Data\nThe following table summarizes the maturity of our debt as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions):\n(1)\nIn conjunction with our $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan, which matures in March 2024, we entered into an interest rate swap, and as of December 31, 2023, the effective interest rate on this term loan, after giving effect to the interest rate swap, was 3.8%.\n(2)\nThe maturity date for our 2023 term loans reflects the closing of our previous twelve-month extension option and assumes the additional twelve-month extension available at the company's option is exercised. In conjunction with closing, we executed one-year variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps, which fix our per annum interest rate at 5.0% over the initial term. Accordingly, the 2023 term loans have been presented as fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2023 in the table above.\n(3)\nIn January 2023, we issued $500.0 million of 5.05% senior unsecured notes due January 13, 2026, which were callable at par beginning on January 13, 2024. In conjunction with the pricing of these senior unsecured notes due January 2026, we executed three-year, fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps totaling $500.0 million, which are subject to the counterparties' right to terminate the swaps at any time following the 2026 notes par call date.\n(4)\nExcludes net premiums and discounts recorded on mortgages payable, net premiums recorded on notes payable, deferred financing costs on term loans, mortgages payable, notes payable, and the basis adjustment on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on notes payable.\n44\n(5)\nWe base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate mortgages and private senior notes payable at December 31, 2023, on the relevant forward interest rate curve, plus an applicable credit-adjusted spread. We base the estimated fair value of the publicly traded fixed rate senior notes and bonds at December 31, 2023, on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable. We believe that the carrying values of the line of credit, commercial paper borrowings, and term loan balances reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at December 31, 2023.\nThe table above incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2023. It does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2023, our outstanding mortgages payable, notes, and bonds had fixed interest rates. Interest on our credit facility and commercial paper borrowings and term loans is variable. However, the variable interest rate feature on our term loans have been mitigated by interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2023, a 1% change in interest rates on our variable-rate debt would change our interest costs by $12.6 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. We continuously evaluate and manage our foreign currency risk through the use of derivative financial instruments, including currency exchange swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts with financial counterparties where practicable. Such derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. Additionally, our inability to redeploy rent receipts from our international operations on a timely basis subjects us to foreign exchange risk.\n45"

    "text": "Table of Contents\n46\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nRealty Income Corporation:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 21, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the Fair Value of Land in Real Estate Acquisitions\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2023 the Company acquired $8.2 billion of real estate properties. As discussed in Note 1, the purchase price of a real estate acquisition is typically allocated among the individual components of both tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated relative fair values.\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value of land in real estate acquisitions as a critical audit matter. Specifically, the measurement of the fair values of land is dependent upon significant assumptions of market land values for which relevant external market data is not always readily available. Subjective and complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the fair value measurements given the sensitivity of the fair value measurements to changes in these assumptions.\n47\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s process to allocate the purchase price of real estate acquisitions. This included controls over the measurement of the fair value of land. For a selection of real estate acquisitions, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating a selection of the Company’s acquired land values by comparing them to independently developed ranges using market data from industry transaction databases and published industry reports.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1993.\nSan Diego, California\nFebruary 21, 2024\n48\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nRealty Income Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated\nFebruary 21, 2024\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nSan Diego, California\nFebruary 21, 2024\n49\nREALTY INCOME CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.\n50\nREALTY INCOME CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.\n51\nREALTY INCOME CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY\n(in thousands)\nYears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.\n52\nREALTY INCOME CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousands)\nFor supplemental disclosures, see\nnote\n18\n,\nS\nupplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information\n.\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.\n53\nREALTY INCOME CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRealty Income Corporation (“Realty Income,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) was founded in 1969 and is organized as a Maryland corporation. We invest in commercial real estate and have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"). We are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol “O”.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned or held interests in a diversified portfolio of\n13,458\nproperties located in all 50 states of the United States (\"U.S.\"), Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, with approximately\n272.1\nmillion\nsquare feet of leasable space.\nInformation with respect to number of properties, leasable square feet, average initial lease term and initial weighted average cash yield is unaudited.\nBasis of Presentation\n. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") is our reporting currency. Unless otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts are expressed in USD.\nFor our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the USD, we translate their financial statements into USD at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries’ financial statements. Generally, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income', (\"AOCI\"), on our consolidated balance sheets. Certain balance sheet items, primarily equity and capital-related accounts, are reflected at the historical exchange rate. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.\nWe and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany and third-party debt that is not denominated in our functional currency. When the debt is remeasured to the functional currency of the entity, a gain or loss can result. The resulting adjustment is reflected in 'Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net' in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. In the statement of cash flows, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the time of the respective cash flows or at average exchange rates for the period, depending on the nature of the cash flow items.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Realty Income and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 810,\nConsolidation.\nVoting interest entities (\"VOEs\") are entities considered to have sufficient equity at risk and which the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity’s activities. We consolidate voting interest entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, which we typically have through holding of a majority of the entity’s voting equity interests.\nVariable interest entities (\"VIEs\") are entities that lack sufficient equity at risk or where the equity holders either do not have the obligation to absorb losses, do not have the right to receive residual returns, do not have the right to make decisions about the entity’s activities, or some combination of the above. A controlling financial interest in a VIE is present when an entity has a variable interest, or a combination of variable interests, that provides the entity with (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. An entity that meets both conditions above is deemed the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. We reassess our initial evaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when certain reconsideration events occur. We reassess our determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current facts and circumstances.\nAt December 31, 2023, we are considered the primary beneficiary of Realty Income, L.P. and certain investments, including investments in joint ventures.\nBelow is a summary of selected financial data of such consolidated VIEs, included on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n54\nThe portion of a consolidated entity not owned by us is recorded as a noncontrolling interest. Noncontrolling interests are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of equity. Noncontrolling interests that were created or assumed as part of a business combination or asset acquisition were recognized at fair value as of the date of the transaction (see\nnote\n12,\nNoncontrolling Interests\n).\nReclassification\n. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nValue-added tax receivable is included in 'Other assets, net', on our consolidated balance sheets. Previously, this was categorized as 'Accounts receivable, net' on our consolidated balance sheets.\nUse of Estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nNet Income per Common Share.\nBasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders, plus income attributable to dilutive shares and convertible common units for the period, by the weighted average number of common shares that would have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period.\nFor more detail, see note\n17, Net Income per Common Share.\nCash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n. We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash includes cash proceeds from the sale of assets held by qualified intermediaries in anticipation of the acquisition of replacement properties in tax-free exchanges under Section 1031 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, impounds related to mortgages payable and cash that is not immediately available to Realty Income (i.e. escrow deposits for future acquisitions).\nCash accounts maintained on behalf of Realty Income in demand deposits at commercial banks and money market funds may exceed federally insured levels or may be held in accounts without any federal insurance or any other insurance or guarantee. However, Realty Income has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nIncome Taxes.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe we have qualified and continue to qualify as a REIT. Under the REIT operating structure, we are permitted to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in determining our taxable income. Assuming our dividends equal or exceed our taxable net income in the U.S., we generally will not be required to pay U.S. income taxes on such income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, except for federal income taxes of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRS\"). A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to federal, state and local income taxes, as applicable. Our use of TRS entities enables us to engage in certain business activities while complying with the REIT qualification requirements and to retain any income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement to distribute those earnings. For our international territories, we are liable for taxes in the United Kingdom and Spain. Accordingly, provisions have been made for U.K. and Spain income taxes. Therefore, the income taxes recorded on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income represent amounts accrued or paid by Realty Income and its subsidiaries for U.S. income taxes on our TRS entities, city and state income and franchise taxes, and income taxes for the U.K. and Spain.\nEarnings and profits that determine the taxability of distributions to stockholders differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily due to differences in the estimated useful lives and methods used to compute depreciation and the carrying value (basis) of the investments in properties for tax purposes, among other things.\n55\nWe regularly analyze our various international, federal and state filing positions and only recognize the income tax effect in our financial statements when certain criteria regarding uncertain income tax positions have been met. We believe that our income tax positions would more likely than not be sustained upon examination by all relevant taxing authorities. Therefore, no provisions for uncertain tax positions have been recorded on our consolidated financial statements.\nLease Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable.\nThe majority of our leases are accounted for as operating leases. Under this method, leases that have fixed and determinable rent increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any rental revenue contingent upon our client’s sales, or percentage rent, is recognized only after our client exceeds their sales breakpoint. Rental increases based upon changes in the consumer price indices are recognized only after the changes in the indexes have occurred and are then applied according to the lease agreements. Contractually obligated rental revenue from our clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses are included in contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients, a component of rental revenue, in the period when such costs are incurred. Taxes and operating expenses paid directly by our clients are recorded on a net basis.\nOther revenue includes certain property-related revenue not included in rental revenue and interest income recognized on financing receivables for certain leases with above-market terms.\nWe assess the probability of collecting substantially all of the lease payments to which we are entitled under the original lease contract as required under ASC 842,\nLeases\n. We assess the collectability of our future lease payments based on an analysis of creditworthiness, economic trends and other facts and circumstances related to the applicable clients. If we conclude the collection of substantially all of lease payments under a lease is less than probable, rental revenue recognized for that lease is limited to cash received going forward, existing operating lease receivables, including those related to straight-line rental revenue, must be written off as an adjustment to rental revenue, and no further operating lease receivables are recorded for that lease until such future determination is made that substantially all lease payments under that lease are now considered probable. If we subsequently conclude that the collection of substantially all lease payments under a lease is probable, a reversal of lease receivables previously written off is recognized.\nLoans Receivable\n. The loans we acquired during 2023 are classified as held for investment and\nare carried at their amortized cost basis. We recognize interest income on loans receivable using the effective-interest method. Direct costs associated with originating loans, along with any premium or discount, are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. When management identifies the full recovery of the contractually specified payments of principal and interest of a loan is less than probable, we evaluate the expected loss amount and place it on non-accrual status. We made the accounting policy election to record accrued interest on our loan portfolio separate from our loan receivable and other lending investments.\nThese loans and the related interest receivable are presented in 'Other assets, net' on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n. The allowance for credit losses, which is recorded as a reduction to loans receivable and financing receivable within 'Other assets, net' on our consolidated balance sheets, is measured using a probability of default method based on our client's respective credit ratings and the expected value of the underlying collateral upon its repossession. Included in our model are factors that incorporate forward-looking information. Allowance for credit losses is presented in 'Provisions for impairment' in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a provision for credit losses of $\n4.9\nmillion, which includes $\n2.5\nmillion of allowances on loans receivable and $\n2.4\nmillion of allowances on financing receivables.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\n. When real estate is sold, the carrying amount of the applicable assets is derecognized with a corresponding gain from the sale recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We record a gain on sale of real estate pursuant to provisions under ASC 610-20\n, Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\n. We determine whether we would have a controlling financial interest in the property after the sale. We record a gain from the sale of real estate provided that various criteria, relating to the terms of the sale and any subsequent involvement by us with the real estate, have been met.\nAllocation of the Purchase Price of Real Estate Acquisitions\n. We evaluate whether or not substantially all of the value of acquired assets is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition or a business combination. A majority of our\n56\nacquisitions qualify as asset acquisitions, and the transaction costs associated with those acquisitions are capitalized. On the other hand, we expense the transaction costs and categorize them as merger and integration-related costs on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for transactions that qualify as a business combination. For business combinations, we recognize the amount of any purchase consideration that exceeds the fair value of all identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill and may record measurement period adjustments within one year of the acquisition date as permitted under ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n.\nFor asset acquisitions, we allocate the cost of real estate acquired, inclusive of transaction costs, to: (1) land, (2) building and improvements, and (3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their relative estimated fair values. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market or below-market lease value of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable. Additionally, above-market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as financing receivables amortizing over the lease term, while below-market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as prepaid rent. In an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair values of the land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, utilizing market-based evidence and commonly applied valuation approaches. In addition, any assumed notes payable or mortgages are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors, such as industry type, client investment grade, maturity date, and comparable borrowings for similar assets. The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses.\nOur estimated fair value determinations are based on management’s judgment, utilizing various factors, including: market land and building values, market rental rates, discount rates and capitalization rates. Our methodology for measuring and allocating the fair value of real estate acquisitions includes both observable market data (categorized as level 2 on the three-level valuation hierarchy of ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement\n), and unobservable inputs that reflect our own internal assumptions (categorized as level 3 under ASC 820). Given the significance of the unobservable inputs we believe the allocations of fair value of real estate acquisitions should be categorized as level 3 under ASC 820. From time to time, we have used, and may continue to use, the assistance of independent third parties specializing in real estate valuations to prepare our purchase price allocations.\nThe allocation of tangible assets (which includes land and buildings/improvements) of an acquired property with an in-place lease is based upon relative fair value. Land is typically valued utilizing the sales comparison (or market) approach. Buildings and improvements are typically valued under the replacement cost approach. In allocating the fair value to identified intangibles for above-market or below-market leases, an amount is recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rate for the corresponding in-place lease, measured over the remaining assumed contract term of the lease. The value of in-place leases is determined by our estimated costs related to acquiring a client and the carrying costs that would be incurred over the vacancy period to locate a client if the property were vacant, considering market conditions and costs to execute similar leases at the time of acquisition.\nThe values of the above-market and below-market leases are amortized over the term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal options, as an adjustment to rental revenue on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases. If a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate.\nReal Estate and Lease Intangibles Held for Sale.\nWe generally reclassify assets to held for sale when the disposition has been approved, there are no known contingencies relating to the sale and the consummation of the disposition is considered probable within one year. Upon classifying a real estate investment as held for sale, we will no longer recognize depreciation expense related to the depreciable assets of the property. Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value, less the estimated cost to dispose of the assets.\nTwenty-nine\nproperties were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2023.\nIf circumstances arise that we previously considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale, we will reclassify the property as held for investment. We measure and record\n57\na property that is reclassified as held for investment at the lower of (i) its carrying value before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for investment or (ii) the estimated fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entities.\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities of which we are not considered the primary beneficiary, include VIEs and are accounted for using the equity method as we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing policies of these investments. We initially recognize the fair value of our contribution as an equity method investment. We subsequently adjust these balances for our proportionate share of net earnings/losses of the entities, distributions received and contributions made. Transaction costs related to the formation of equity method investments are also capitalized, resulting in a basis difference. This basis difference is amortized over the estimated useful life of the respective underlying assets and/or liabilities. The carrying value of our investment is included in 'Investment in unconsolidated entities' on our consolidated balance sheets. We record our proportionate share of net income from the unconsolidated entities in 'Equity in income and impairment of investment in unconsolidated entities' in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. With regard to distributions from unconsolidated entities, we have elected the nature of distribution approach as the information is available to us to determine the nature of the underlying activity that generated the distributions. In accordance with such approach, cash flows generated from the operations of an unconsolidated entity are classified as a return on investment (cash inflow from operating activities) and cash flows that are generated from other activities, such as property sales, debt refinancing or sale and redemptions of our investments of our investments are classified as a return of investment (cash inflow from investing activities). Our contribution to the unconsolidated entities or any distributions from them as returns of investment are classified as investing activities.\nOur investment in unconsolidated entities includes preferred interests. Upon acquisition, we assess whether such investment should be considered debt or equity securities based on investment terms. As of December 31, 2023, our investment balance includes preferred interests classified as equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, for which we elect to apply the measurement alternative and record the value of the investment at cost, less any applicable impairment.\nGoodwill.\nUpon the closing of a business combination, after identifying all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, the excess consideration paid over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and assumed, respectively, represents goodwill.\nDeferred Financing Costs.\nDeferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees and other costs associated with obtaining or originating financing. Deferred financing costs, other than those associated with the line of credit, are presented on our consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. Deferred financing costs related to the line of credit are included in 'other assets, net' in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized to interest expense over the terms of the respective financing agreements that approximates the effective interest method.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n. Land, buildings and improvements are recorded and stated at cost. Major replacements and betterments, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, while ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Buildings and improvements that are under redevelopment, or are being developed, are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded on these assets. Additionally, amounts essential to the development of the property, such as pre-construction, development, construction, interest and other costs incurred during the period of development are capitalized. We cease capitalization when the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of property improvements to accommodate the client's use, but in any event no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity.\nProperties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\n58\nProvisions for Impairment - Real Estate Assets.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property, a fair value analysis is performed and, to the extent the estimated fair value is less than the current book value, a provision for impairment is recorded to reduce the book value to estimated fair value. Key assumptions that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates. For further details, see note\n13, Fair Value Measurements.\nProvisions for Impairment - Goodwill.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment reviews annually, or more frequently if necessary. Goodwill is qualitatively assessed to determine whether a quantitative impairment assessment is necessary. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were\nno\nimpairments of goodwill.\nProvisions for Impairment - Investment in Unconsolidated Entities.\nDuring our ownership of properties that are accounted for under the equity method and considered unconsolidated entities, and when circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an equity method investment has occurred that is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment loss, which requires significant judgment. To determine whether the impairment loss is other-than-temporary, we consider whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until the carrying value is fully recovered. We evaluate the impairment of our investment in unconsolidated entities in accordance with accounting standards for equity investments by first reviewing each investment for indicators of impairment. If indicators are present, we estimate the fair value of the investments. If the carrying value of the investment is greater than the estimated fair value, we make an assessment of whether the impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary. In making this assessment, we consider the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the entity, and our intent and ability to retain the interest long enough for a recovery in market value. The investment is then reduced to its estimated fair value if conclusions indicate the impairment is other than temporary.\nEquity Offering Costs.\nUnderwriting commissions and offering costs have been reflected as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital on our consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative and Hedging Activities\n. Derivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties with returns linked to or “derived” from an underlying equity, debt, commodity, other asset, liability, interest rate, foreign exchange rate or another index, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event. The settlement of a derivative is determined by its underlying notional amount specified in the contract. Derivative contracts may be entered into outright or embedded within a non-derivative host contract, and may be listed, traded on exchanges or privately negotiated directly between two parties.\nWe actively manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures arising from our liquidity and funding activities using derivative instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The majority of inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives is recorded in net income unless the derivative is designated as a cash flow or net investment hedge, in which case the change in fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income and\nsubsequently reclassified to a designated account\nin our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income\nin the periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nSegment Reporting.\nOur business is characterized as owning and leasing commercial properties under long-term, mostly triple net lease agreements (whereby clients are responsible for property taxes, insurance and maintenance\n59\ncosts), and these economic characteristics are similar across various property types, geographic locations, and industries in which our clients operate. Information reviewed by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating performance and allocating resources are primarily operating results and cash flow analysis for the overall company. Therefore, we operate and manage the business in\none\noperating and reportable segment.\nASC 280,\nSegment Reporting,\nrequires certain entity-wide annual disclosures for entities with a single reportable segment.\nThe following table disaggregates domestic and international revenue by major asset types and geographic regions (in millions):\n(1)\nOther includes properties in Spain, starting in September 2021, in Italy, starting in October 2022,\nin Ireland, starting in June 2023, and in France, Germany, and Portugal starting in December 2023.\n(2)\nOther includes the following asset types: office, agriculture and gaming.\nLong-lived assets include items such as property, plant, equipment and right-of-use assets subject to operating and finance leases.\nAs of December 31, 2023, no individual country or asset-type represented more than 10% of total revenue, other than as presented in the tables above. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, no individual country or asset-type represented more than 10% of the total assets, other than as presented in the tables below. The following table disaggregates domestic and international total long-lived assets (in millions):\n(1)\nOther includes properties in Spain, starting in September 2021, in Italy, starting in October 2022,\nin Ireland, starting in June 2023, and in France, Germany, and Portugal, starting in December 2023.\n60\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes\n, to enhance income tax disclosures, provide more information about tax risks and opportunities present in worldwide operations, and to disaggregate existing income tax disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis, with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2023, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting\n, establishing improvements to reportable segments disclosures to enhance segment reporting under Topic 280. This ASU aims to change how public entities identify and aggregate operating segments and apply quantitative thresholds to determine their reportable segments. This ASU also requires public entities that operate as a single reportable segment to provide all segment disclosures in Topic 280, not just entity level disclosures. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and the amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statement disclosures.\n2.\nMerger with VEREIT, Inc. and Orion Office REIT Inc. Divestiture\nMerger with VEREIT\nOn November 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of VEREIT, Inc. (\"VEREIT\"), and the merger was consummated. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to the terms thereof, upon the consummation of the merger, (i) each outstanding share of VEREIT common stock, and each outstanding common partnership unit of VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P., (\"VEREIT OP\") owned by any of its partners other than VEREIT, Realty Income or their respective affiliates, was automatically converted into\n0.705\nof newly issued shares of our common stock, or in certain instances, Realty Income L.P. units, and (ii) each VEREIT OP outstanding common unit owned by VEREIT, Realty Income or their respective affiliates remained outstanding as partnership interests in the surviving entity. Each outstanding VEREIT stock option and restricted stock unit that were unvested as of November 1, 2021 were converted into equivalent options and restricted stock units, in each case with respect to the share of the Company's common stock, using the equity award exchange ratio in accordance with the Merger Agreement.\nA.    Merger and Integration-Related Costs\nIn conjunction with our merger with VEREIT, we incurred merger-related transaction costs of $\n4.8\nmillion, $\n13.9\nmillion, and $\n167.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Merger and integration-related costs consist of advisory fees, attorney fees, accountant fees, public filing fees and additional incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data and systems, retain employees and otherwise enable us to operate the acquired business or assets efficiently.\nB.    Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\nOur consolidated results of operations for year ended December 31, 2021 include $\n176.3\nmillion of revenues and $\n36.7\nmillion of net income associated with the results of operations of VEREIT OP.\nThe following unaudited pro forma information presents a summary of our combined results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as if our merger with VEREIT had occurred on January 1, 2020 (in millions, except per share data). The following pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations had the acquisition been effected on the assumed date, nor is it necessarily an indication of trends in future results. In accordance with ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n, the following information excludes the impact of the spin-off of office assets to Orion Office REIT Inc. (\"Orion\").\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information above includes the following nonrecurring significant adjustment made to account for certain costs incurred as if our merger with VEREIT had been completed on January 1, 2020: merger and integration-related costs of $\n167.4\nmillion were excluded within the pro forma financial information for 2021.\n61\nOrion Divestiture\nFollowing of the closing of our merger with VEREIT, we contributed\n92\noffice real estate assets, a consolidated real estate venture holding\none\noffice asset, and an unconsolidated real estate venture holding\nfive\noffice assets to a wholly owned subsidiary named Orion. On November 12, 2021, we distributed the outstanding shares of Orion common stock to our shareholders on a pro rata basis at a rate of\none\nshare of Orion common stock for every ten shares of Realty Income common stock held on November 12, 2021, the applicable record date. The fair market value of these shares for tax distribution was determined to be $\n20.6272\nper share, which was calculated using the five-day volume weighted average share price after issuance. For more detail, see note\n16, Distributions Paid and Payable\n.\nIn conjunction with the Orion Divestiture, we incurred approximately $\n1.9\nmillion and $\n6.0\nmillion of transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, which were included in 'Merger and integration-related costs' within our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nAs part of the Orion Divestiture, Orion paid us a dividend of $\n425.0\nmillion and reimbursed $\n170.2\nmillion to us for the early redemption of mortgage loans underlying the contributed assets prior to the effectuation of the Orion Divestiture. The distribution of Orion resulted in the derecognition of net assets of $\n1.74\nbillion, which net of the aforementioned cash payments of $\n595.2\nmillion, resulted in a reduction to additional paid in capital of $\n1.14\nbillion.\n3.\nSupplemental Detail for Certain Components of Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands):\n62\n4.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nA.    Acquisitions of Real Estate\nBelow is a summary of our acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2023 (unaudited):\n(1)\nThe initial weighted average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property. Since it is possible that a client could default on the payment of contractual rent (defined as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables), we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above. Contractual net operating income used in the calculation of initial weighted average cash lease yield includes approximately $\n4.4\nmillion received as settlement credits as reimbursement of free rent periods for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return. When the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the initial weighted average cash lease yield is computed as follows: estimated cash net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs.\n(2)\nIncludes £\n34.3\nmillion of investments in U.K. development properties and €\n29.3\nmillion of investment in Spain development properties, converted at the applicable exchange rates on the funding dates.\n(3)\nOur clients occupying the new properties are\n88.7\n% retail,\n8.5\n% industrial, and\n2.8\n% other property types based on net operating income. Approximately\n31.4\n% of the net operating income generated from acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2023 is from investment grade rated clients, their subsidiaries, or affiliated companies.\n63\nThe aggregate purchase price of the assets acquired during the year ended December 31, 2023 has been allocated as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nSterling-denominated land includes £\n7.1\nmillion of right of use assets under long-term ground leases.\n(2)\nThe weighted average amortization period for acquired lease intangible assets is\n11.3\nyears.\n(3)\nUSD-denominated other assets consist entirely of financing receivables with above-market terms. Sterling-denominated other assets primarily consist of\n£\n66.1\nmillion of financing receivables with above-market terms and £\n191.1\nmillion of right-of-use assets accounted for as finance leases. Euro-denominated other assets consist of\n€\n17.4\nmillion of financing receivables with above-market terms, €\n10.6\nmillion of right-of-use assets accounted for as finance leases and €\n7.2\nmillion of right-of-use assets under ground leases.\n(4)\nThe weighted average amortization period for acquired lease intangible liabilities is\n16.9\nyears.\n(5)\nUSD-denominated other liabilities consist\nentirely of deferred rent on certain below-market leases. Sterling-denominated other liabilities primarily consist of £\n2.3\nmillion of deferred rent on certain below-market leases and £\n0.2\nmillion of lease liabilities under financing leases. Euro-denominated other liabilities consists of €\n1.6\nmillion of deferred rent on certain below-market leases, €\n4.4\nmillion of lease liabilities under ground leases, €\n2.1\nmillion of lease liabilities under financing leases, and €\n1.5\nmillion of other liabilities.\nThe properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2023 generated total revenue and net income of $\n302.3\nmillion and $\n152.4\nmillion, respectively.\nB.    Investments in Existing Properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we capitalized costs of $\n59.8\nmillion on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $\n49.6\nmillion for non-recurring building improvements, $\n9.9\nmillion for re-leasing costs, and $\n0.3\nmillion for recurring capital expenditures. In comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we capitalized costs of $\n96.7\nmillion on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $\n88.3\nmillion for non-recurring building improvements, $\n5.2\nmillion for re-leasing costs, and $\n3.2\nmillion for recurring capital expenditures.\nC.    Properties with Existing Leases\nThe value of the in-place and above-market leases is recorded to 'Lease intangible assets, net' on our consolidated balance sheets, and the value of the below-market leases is recorded to 'Lease intangible liabilities, net' on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe values of the in-place leases are amortized as depreciation and amortization expense. The amounts amortized to expense for all of our in-place leases, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $\n651.1\nmillion, $\n634.9\nmillion, and $\n247.6\nmillion, respectively.\nThe values of the above-market and below-market leases are amortized over the term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal options, as an adjustment to rental revenue in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The amounts amortized as a net decrease to rental revenue for capitalized above-market and below-market leases for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $\n61.5\nmillion,\n$\n55.6\nmillion, and $\n35.4\nmillion, respectively. If a lease was to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recorded to revenue or expense, as appropriate.\nThe following table presents the estimated impact during the next five years and thereafter related to the amortization of the above-market and below-market lease intangibles and the amortization of the in-place lease intangibles at December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n64\nD.    Gain on Sales of Real Estate\nThe following table summarizes our properties sold during the periods indicated below (dollars in millions):\n5.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nThe following is a summary of our investments in unconsolidated entities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n(1)\nThe total carrying amount of the investments was greater than the underlying equity in net assets (i.e., basis difference) by $\n2.2\nmillion as of December 31, 2023.\nEquity in income and impairment of investment in unconsolidated entities consists of the following (in thousands):\nA.    Bellagio Las Vegas Joint Venture Interests\nIn October 2023, we invested $\n951.4\nmillion to acquire common and preferred interests from Blackstone Real Estate Trust, Inc. (\"BREIT\") in a joint venture that owns a\n95.0\n% interest in the real estate of The Bellagio Las Vegas. The investment included $\n301.4\nmillion of common equity in the joint venture in exchange for an indirect interest of\n21.9\n% in the property and a $\n650.0\nmillion preferred equity interest in the joint venture. The unconsolidated entity had total debt outstanding of $\n3.0\nbillion as of December 31, 2023, all of which was non-recourse to us with limited customary exceptions.\nThe Company's preferred equity investment entitles it to certain preferential cumulative distributions out of operating and capital proceeds pursuant to the terms and conditions of the preferred equity. There is no maturity date on the preferred equity investment, which bears interest of\n8.1\n%, payable monthly in arrears in cash, with rate increases commencing in year 7. BREIT may cause the joint venture to redeem all or a portion of the preferred equity investment, and Realty Income may cause the joint venture to redeem all or a portion of the preferred equity investment if BREIT or its affiliates cease to control the joint venture, in each case, for a cash payment equaling the sum of the amount to be redeemed plus, prior to the first anniversary of the transaction, a redemption fee of\n3.0\n%, or, after the first anniversary and prior to the fourth anniversary of the transaction, a redemption fee of\n2.0\n%. Interest income is determined by applying the interest rate to the sum of the outstanding balance of preferred equity and any accrued but unpaid interests. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized interest income of $\n13.0\nmillion included within 'Other revenue' in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\n65\nWe have determined that this joint venture is a VIE, and we are not the primary beneficiary as we do not have power to direct activities that most significantly impact the joint venture's economic performance. As a holder of preferred interests, we do not receive any additional voting rights, nor do we have conversion and redemption rights. Our maximum exposure to loss associated with this VIE is limited to our common and preferred equity investments.\nB.    Data Center Development Joint Venture\nIn November 2023, we established a joint venture with Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (\"Digital Realty\") to support the development of\ntwo\nbuild-to-suit data centers in Northern Virginia. We invested $\n201.2\nmillion to acquire an\n80.0\n% equity interest in the venture, while Digital Realty maintains a\n20.0\n% interest. We have determined that this joint venture is a VIE. While we have an\n80.0\n% interest in the joint venture, we are not the primary beneficiary because we do not have power to direct activities that significantly impact the joint venture's economic performance as we were not engaged when the joint venture partner initially developed the construction plan and entered into the lease agreement. Digital Realty is the managing member, and we do not have substantive kick-out rights. We will continuously evaluate whether we are the primary beneficiary as the power to direct activities that most significantly affect economic performance can change over the life of the joint venture. Our maximum exposure to loss associated with this VIE is limited to our equity investment and our pro rata share of the remaining $\n117.7\nmillion of estimated development costs for the first phase of the project.\nC.    Industrial Partnerships\nAll\nseven\nassets held by our industrial partnerships were sold during the year ended December 31, 2022. As the portion of the net proceeds applied to our investment basis that we expected to receive at closing was less than our $\n121.4\nmillion carrying amount of investment in unconsolidated entities, we recognized an other than temporary impairment of $\n8.5\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2022. The other than temporary impairments are included in 'Equity in income and impairment of investment in unconsolidated entities' in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the periods presented.\n6.\nInvestments in Loans\nThe following table presents information about our loans as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nThe total carrying amount of the investment in loans excludes\naccrued interest\nof $\n3.4\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, which is recorded to 'Other assets, net' on our consolidated balance sheets.\nA.    Senior Secured Note Receivable\nIn November 2023, the Company purchased a Sterling-denominated senior secured note with a principal amount of £\n142.0\nmillion, equivalent to $\n180.9\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The interest only note bears interest at Sterling Overnight Indexed Average (“SONIA”) plus\n6.75\n% and matures in October 2029. The Company paid £\n136.7\nmillion for the note and accounted for the discount at amortized cost. The discount is being amortized over the term of the note.\nB.    Mortgage Loan\nIn October 2023, the Company issued a $\n33.5\nmillion mortgage loan which is collateralized by\nnine\nautomotive service properties located across\nseven\ndifferent states. The interest only loan bears interest at\n8.25\n% subject to annual increases and matures in October 2038.\n7.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Programs\nA.    Credit Facility\nWe have a $\n4.25\nbillion unsecured revolving multicurrency credit facility that matures in June 2026, includes\ntwo\nsix-month\nextensions that can be exercised at our option, and allows us to borrow in up to\n14\ncurrencies, including USD. Our revolving credit facility also has a $\n1.0\nbillion expansion option, which is subject to obtaining lender commitments. Under our revolving credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for USD borrowings at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), plus\n0.725\n% with a SOFR adjustment charge of\n0.10\n% and a revolving credit facility fee of\n0.125\n%, for all-in pricing of\n0.95\n% over SOFR, British Pound Sterling at\n66\nthe SONIA, plus\n0.725\n% with a SONIA adjustment charge of\n0.0326\n% and a revolving credit facility fee of\n0.125\n%, for all-in pricing of\n0.8826\n% over SONIA, and Euro Borrowings at one-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), plus\n0.725\n%, and a revolving credit facility fee of\n0.125\n%, for all-in pricing of\n0.85\n% over one-month EURIBOR.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had a borrowing capacity of $\n4.25\nbillion available on our revolving credit facility (subject to customary conditions to borrowing) and\nno\noutstanding balance as compared to an outstanding balance at December 31, 2022 of $\n2.0\nbillion, comprised of\n€\n1.8\nbillion Euro and £\n70.0\nmillion Sterling borrowings.\nThe weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility was\n4.8\n% during the year ended December 31, 2023, and\n1.8\n% during the year ended December 31, 2022. Our revolving credit facility is subject to various leverage and interest coverage ratio limitations, and at December 31, 2023,\nwe were in compliance with the covenants under our revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2023, credit facility origination costs of\n$\n12.3\nmillion\nare included in 'Other assets, net', as compared to $\n17.2\nmillion at December 31, 2022, on our consolidated balance sheets. These costs are being amortized over the remaining term of our revolving credit facility.\nB.    Commercial Paper Programs\nWe have a USD-denominated unsecured commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $\n1.5\nbillion, as well as a Euro-denominated unsecured commercial paper program, which permits us to issue additional unsecured commercial notes up to a maximum aggregate amount of $\n1.5\nbillion (or foreign currency equivalent). Our Euro-denominated unsecured commercial paper program may be issued in USD or various foreign currencies, including but not limited to, Euros, Sterling, Swiss Francs, Yen, Canadian Dollars, and Australian Dollars, in each case, pursuant to customary terms in the European commercial paper market.\nThe commercial paper ranks on a parity in right of payment with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness outstanding from time to time, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, our term loans and our outstanding senior unsecured notes. Proceeds from commercial paper borrowings are used for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2023,\nthe balance of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs was $\n764.4\nmillion, including €\n583.0\nmillion of Euro-denominated borrowings, as compared to\n$\n701.8\nmillion\noutstanding commercial paper borrowings, including €\n361.0\nmillion of EUR borrowings, at December 31, 2022. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs was\n4.8\n% for the year ended December 31, 2023, and\n1.6\n% for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, our weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs was\n4.4\n%. We use our $\n4.25\nbillion revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of the notes issued under the commercial paper programs. The commercial paper borrowings generally carry a term of less than a year\n.\nWe regularly review our credit facility and commercial paper programs and may seek to extend, renew or replace our credit facility and commercial paper programs, to the extent we deem appropriate.\n8.\nTerm Loans\nIn January 2023, we entered into a term loan agreement, permitting us to incur multicurrency term loans, up to an aggregate of $\n1.5\nbillion in total borrowings. As of December 31, 2023, we had $\n1.1\nbillion in multicurrency borrowings, including $\n90.0\nmillion, £\n705.0\nmillion, and €\n85.0\nmillion in outstanding borrowings. The 2023 term loans mature in January 2025, with\none\nremaining\ntwelve-month\nmaturity extension available at our option. Our A3/A- credit ratings provide for a borrowing rate of\n80\nbasis points over the applicable benchmark rate, which includes adjusted SOFR for USD-denominated loans, adjusted SONIA for Sterling-denominated loans, and EURIBOR for Euro-denominated loans. In conjunction with our 2023 term loans, we entered into interest rate swaps which fix our per annum interest rate. As of December 31, 2023, the effective interest rate, after giving effect to the interest rate swaps, was\n5.0\n%.\nWe also have a $\n250.0\nmillion senior unsecured term loan, which matures in March 2024. In conjunction with this term loan, we entered into an interest rate swap and as of December 31, 2023, the effective interest rate on this term loan, after giving effect to the interest rate swap, was\n3.8\n%.\n67\nAt December 31, 2023, deferred financing costs of\n$\n0.1\nmillion are included net of the term loans principal balance, as compared to $\n0.2\nmillion related to our $\n250.0\nmillion term loan at December 31, 2022, on our consolidated balance sheets. These costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the term loans. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the term loans.\n9.\nMortgages Payable\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we made $\n22.0\nmillion in principal payments, including the full repayment of\ntwo\nmortgages for $\n17.4\nmillion. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made $\n312.2\nmillion in principal payments, including the full repayment of\n12\nmortgages for $\n308.0\nmillion.\nNo\nmortgages were assumed during the year ended December 31, 2023. We assumed\neight\nmortgages on\n17\nproperties totaling $\n45.1\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2022. Assumed mortgages are secured by the properties on which the debt was placed and are considered non-recourse debt with limited customary exceptions which vary from loan to loan.\nOur mortgages contain customary covenants, such as limiting our ability to further mortgage each applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage without the prior consent of the lender. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nThe balance of our deferred financing costs, which are classified as part of 'Mortgages payable, net', on our consolidated balance sheets, was $\n0.4\nmillion and $\n0.8\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These costs are being amortized over the remaining term of each mortgage.\nThe following table summarizes our mortgages payable as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in millions):\n(1)\nAt December 31, 2023, there were\n16\nmortgages on\n131\nproperties and at December 31, 2022, there were\n18\nmortgages on\n136\nproperties. With the exception of\none\nSterling-denominated mortgage which is paid quarterly, the mortgages require monthly payments with principal payments due at maturity. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, all mortgages were at fixed interest rates.\n(2)\nStated interest rates ranged from\n3.0\n% to\n6.9\n% at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n(3)\nEffective interest rates ranged from\n0.5\n% to\n6.6\n% and\n2.7\n% to\n6.6\n% at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the maturity of mortgages payable as of December 31, 2023, excluding $\n0.8\nmillion related to unamortized net discounts and deferred financing costs (dollars in millions):\n68\n10.\nNotes Payable\nA.    General\nAt December 31, 2023, our senior unsecured notes and bonds are USD-denominated, Sterling-denominated, and Euro-denominated. Foreign-denominated notes are converted at the applicable exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The following are sorted by maturity date (in thousands):\n(1)\nInterest paid annually. Interest on the remaining senior unsecured notes and bond obligations included in the table is paid semi-annually.\n(2)\nIn January 2023, in conjunction with the pricing of these senior unsecured notes due January 2026, we entered into\nthree-year\n, fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges. See note\n14,\nDerivative Instruments\nfor further details.\n69\nThe following table summarizes the maturity of our notes and bonds payable as of December 31, 2023, excluding $\n40.3\nmillion related to unamortized net premiums, deferred financing costs, and basis adjustment on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges (dollars in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2023, the weighted average interest rate on our notes and bonds payable was\n3.8\n%, and the weighted average remaining years until maturity was\n6.7\nyears.\nInterest incurred on all of the notes and bonds was $\n598.6\nmillion, $\n431.3\nmillion, and $\n286.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOur outstanding notes and bonds are unsecured; accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these or any other obligations.\nAll of these notes and bonds contain various covenants, including: (i) a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed\n60\n%; (ii) a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed\n40\n%; (iii) a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than\n1.5\ntimes; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than\n150\n% of our outstanding unsecured debt. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nB.    Note Issuances\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 we issued the following notes and bonds (in millions):\n(1)\nIn January 2023, we issued $\n500\nmillion of\n5.05\n% senior unsecured notes due January 13, 2026, which were callable at par beginning on January 13, 2024.\nIn January 2024, we issued $\n450.0\nmillion of\n4.750\n%\nsenior unsecured notes due February 2029 and $\n800.0\nmillion of\n5.125\n%\nsenior unsecured notes due February 2034.\nSee note\n21, Subsequent Events,\nfor further details.\n70\nC.    Note Repayments\nWe redeemed the following principal amounts (in millions) of certain outstanding notes, prior to their maturity. As a result of these early redemptions, we recognized the following losses on extinguishment of debt (in millions) in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. There were\nno\ncomparable repayments for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\n(1)\nThe redeemed principal amounts presented exclude the amounts we paid in accrued and unpaid interest.\n11.\nIssuances of Common Stock\nA.    At-the-Market (\"ATM\")\nProgram\nIn August 2023, we replaced our prior ATM program with a new ATM program, pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to\n120.0\nmillion shares of common stock (1) by us to, or through, a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents or (2) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers contemplated thereunder, in each case by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \"O\" at prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. Upon settlement, subject to certain exceptions, we may elect, in our sole discretion, to cash settle or net share settle all or any portion of our obligations under any forward sale agreement, in which cases we may not receive any proceeds (in the case of cash settlement) or will not receive any proceeds (in the case of net share settlement), and we may owe cash (in the case of cash settlement) or shares of our common stock (in the case of net share settlement) to the relevant forward purchaser. Of the\n120.0\nmillion shares of our common stock available for sale under the prior ATM program at its inception, a total of\n101.8\nmillion of those shares were sold, the remainder of which were terminated. As of December 31, 2023, we had\n81.3\nmillion\nshares remaining for future issuance under our new ATM program. We anticipate maintaining the availability of our ATM program in the future, including the replenishment of authorized shares issuable thereunder.\nThe following table outlines common stock issuances pursuant to our ATM programs (dollars in millions, shares in thousands):\n(1)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023,\n91.1\nmillion shares were sold and\n91.7\nmillion shares were settled pursuant to forward sale confirmations. In addition, as of December 31, 2023,\n6.2\nmillion shares of common stock subject to forward sale confirmations have been executed, but not settled, at a weighted average initial gross price of $\n55.03\nper share. We currently expect to fully settle forward sale agreements outstanding by June 30, 2024, representing $\n337.8\nmillion in net proceeds, for which the weighted average forward price at December 31, 2023 was $\n54.70\nper share.\nB.    Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (\"DRSPP\")\nOur DRSPP, provides our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions. Our DRSPP also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions. Our DRSPP authorizes up to\n26.0\nmillion common shares to be issued. At December 31, 2023, we had\n11.0\nmillion shares remaining for future issuance under our DRSPP program.\nThe following table outlines common stock issuances pursuant to our DRSPP program (dollars in millions, shares in thousands):\n71\nC.    Issuance of Common Stock in Connection with VEREIT Acquisition\nOn November 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of VEREIT. As a result of the merger, former VEREIT common stockholders, VEREIT OP common unitholders and awardees of vested share awards separated from Realty Income and received approximately\n162\nmillion shares of Realty Income common stock, based on the shares of VEREIT common stock and common units of VEREIT OP outstanding as of October 29, 2021.\nD.    Issuances of Common Stock in Underwritten Public Offerings\nDuring 2021, we issued an aggregate of\n21.3\nmillion shares of common stock, including\n2.8\nmillion shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. After deducting underwriting discounts, the aggregate net proceeds of $\n1.3\nbillion were used to fund investment opportunities, for general corporate purposes and working capital.\nThere were\nno\ncomparative offerings during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\n12.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have\nseven\nentities with noncontrolling interests that we consolidate, including an operating partnership, Realty Income, L.P., and interests in consolidated property partnerships not wholly-owned by us.\nAt December 31, 2023, outstanding common partnership units in Realty Income, L.P. represented\n6.9\n% ownership interest in Realty Income L.P. We hold the remaining\n93.1\n% interest and consolidate the entity. None of our common partnership units have voting rights. Common partnership units are entitled to monthly distributions equal to the amount paid to common stockholders of Realty Income, and are redeemable in cash or Realty Income common stock, at our option, and at a conversion ratio of\n1.02934\ndue to the Orion Divestiture, subject to certain exceptions. Prior to the Orion Divestiture, the conversion ratio was one to one. These issuances with redemption provisions that permit the issuer to settle in either cash or common stock, at the option of the issuer, were evaluated to determine whether temporary or permanent equity classification on the balance sheet was appropriate. We determined that the units meet the requirements to qualify for presentation as permanent equity.\nThe following table represents the change in the carrying value of all noncontrolling interests through December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n(1)\n1,795,167\nunits were outstanding as of both December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022.\n1,060,709\nunits were outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\n(2)\nIn September 2022, we issued\n734,458\ncommon partnership units in Realty Income, L.P. in connection with the acquisition of\nnine\nproperties and recorded $\n51.2\nmillion of contributions to noncontrolling interests.\n(3)\nPrimarily related to contributions of $\n39.2\nmillion for the issuance of a\n5.0\n% joint venture interest as partial consideration paid on property acquisitions. The remaining amount represents contributions for\ntwo\ndevelopment joint ventures.\n(4)\nIncludes a non-cash reduction of noncontrolling interest of $\n1.5\nmillion from our partner's responsibility to absorb construction cost overages for a development joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2023, we are considered the primary beneficiary of Realty Income, L.P. and other VIEs. For further information,\nsee note\n1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\n72\n13.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).\nASC 820,\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n, sets forth a fair value hierarchy that categorizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Categorization within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n•\nLevel 1 – Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n•\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other market-corroborated inputs\n•\nLevel 3 – Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement\nWe evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from period to period. Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets. We have not historically had changes in classifications and do not expect that changes in classifications between levels will be frequent.\nThe following tables present the carrying values and estimated fair values of financial instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\n(1)\nConsidering the proximity of time between the issuance and measurement of the two loans acquired during the fourth quarter of 2023, we have concluded that the carrying value reasonably approximates the estimated fair value at December 31, 2023. We determined our investment in mortgage loan is categorized as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy given our experience with mortgage borrowings.\n73\nA.    Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets\nThe fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, escrow deposits, accounts payable, distributions payable, line of credit payable and commercial paper borrowings, and other liabilities approximate their carrying value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, due to their short-term nature. The aggregate fair value of our term loans approximates carrying value due to the frequent repricing of the variable interest rate charged on the borrowing.\nThe following table reflects the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments not measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\n(1)\nExcludes non-cash net premiums or discounts recorded on the mortgages payable. The unamortized balance of these net discounts was $\n0.4\nmillion at December 31, 2023, and $\n12.4\nmillion of net premiums at December 31, 2022. Also excludes deferred financing costs of $\n0.4\nmillion at December 31, 2023, and $\n0.8\nmillion at December 31, 2022.\n(2)\nExcludes non-cash net premiums recorded on notes payable. The unamortized balance of the net premiums was $\n125.3\nmillion at December 31, 2023, and $\n224.6\nmillion at December 31, 2022. Also excludes deferred financing costs of $\n83.8\nmillion and a favorable basis adjustment on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of $\n1.3\nmillion at December 31, 2023, and $\n60.7\nmillion of deferred financing costs at December 31, 2022.\nThe estimated fair values of our mortgages payable and private senior notes payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using an interest rate based upon the relevant forward interest rate curve, plus an applicable credit-adjusted spread. Because this methodology includes unobservable inputs that reflect our own internal assumptions and calculations, the measurement of estimated fair values related to our mortgages payable is categorized as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe estimated fair values of our publicly-traded senior notes and bonds payable are based upon indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable. Because this methodology includes inputs that are less observable by the public and are not necessarily reflected in active markets, the measurement of the estimated fair values related to our notes and bonds payable is categorized as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nB.    Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nFor derivative assets and liabilities, we may utilize interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, and forward-starting swaps to manage interest rate risk, and cross-currency swaps, currency exchange swaps, and foreign currency forwards to manage foreign currency risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, spot and forward rates, as well as option volatility\n.\nDerivative fair values also include credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.\nAlthough we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level three inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties. However, at December 31, 2023, and 2022, we assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified as level two. For more details on our derivatives, see note\n14,\nDerivative Instruments\n.\nC.    Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nImpairment of Real Estate Investments\nCertain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are subject to fair value adjustments only under certain circumstances, such as when an impairment write-down occurs.\n74\nDepending on impairment triggering events during the applicable period, impairments are typically recorded for properties sold, in the process of being sold, vacant, in bankruptcy, or experiencing difficulties with collection of rent.\nThe following table summarizes our provisions for impairment on real estate investments during the periods indicated below (in millions):\n(1)\nExcludes provision for current expected credit loss of $\n4.9\nmillion at December 31, 2023.\nThe valuation of impaired assets is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions and purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. We may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of such real estate. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and estimates can differ materially from actual results.\n14.\nDerivative Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to economic risks from interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into derivative financial instruments to offset these underlying economic risks.\nDerivative Designated as Hedging Instruments - Cash Flow Hedges\nWe entered into foreign currency forward contracts to sell GBP, USD, and EUR and buy EUR, USD, and GBP to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with interest payments on intercompany loans denominated in British Pound Sterling (\"GBP\") and Euro (\"EUR\"). Forward points on the forward contracts are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We executed variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements associated with our term loans. To mitigate the impact of fluctuating interest rates, we also entered into interest rate swaption agreements during March 2023, structuring them as swaption corridors, in anticipation of issuing USD denominated bonds. Interest rate swaption corridors are a combination of two swaption positions. Specifically, we purchased a payer swaption, an option that allows us to enter into a swap where we will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap, and we also sold a payer swaption, an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where we will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap. The total premium paid for the March 2023 transaction was $\n7.6\nmillion. All\nthree\nhedging instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.\nDerivative Designated as Hedging Instruments - Fair Value Hedges\nPeriodically, we enter into and designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for variable interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount. We also designate some of our cross-currency swaps as fair value hedges as we use them to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign-denominated debt. For these hedging instruments, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the cross-currency swaps related to both time value and cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (the \"excluded component\"). Changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps attributable to these excluded components are recorded to other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in 'Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net' on a systematic and rational basis, as net cash settlements and interest accruals on the respective cross currency swaps occur, over the remaining life of the hedging instruments.\nDerivative Designated as Hedging Instruments - Net Investment Hedges\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we designated the\nthree\nexisting cross-currency swaps that had not been designated as hedging instruments through the third quarter of 2023 as net investment hedges to mitigate the risks associated with our investment in EUR-denominated foreign operations. These cross-currency swaps qualify as net investment hedges under the criteria prescribed in accordance with ASC Topic 815-20,\nHedging - General\n. We use the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness and apply the consistent election to the excluded component by\n75\nrecognizing changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments attributable to the excluded component in the same manner as described above. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded components and the amounts recognized in earnings is reported in other comprehensive income as part of the foreign cumulative translation adjustment. The gain or loss on the portion of the derivative instruments included in the assessment of effectiveness is reported in other comprehensive income as part of the 'Foreign currency translation adjustment' line item, to the extent the relationship is highly effective. If the company’s net investment changes during a reporting period, the hedge relationship will be assessed for whether a de-designation is warranted (only if the hedge notional amount is outside of prescribed tolerance).\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nWe enter into foreign\ncurrency exchange swap agreements to reduce the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the USD, our reporting currency, and GBP and EUR. These derivative contracts generally mature within\none year\nand are not designated as hedge instruments for accounting purposes. As the currency exchange swap is not accounted for as a hedging instrument, the change in fair value is recorded in earnings through the caption entitled 'Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net'\nin our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nThe following table summarizes the terms and fair values of our derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in millions):\n(1)\nThis column represents the number of instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n(2)\nWeighted average strike rate is calculated using the notional value as of December 31, 2023.\n(3)\nThis column represents maturity dates for instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n(4)\nRepresent purchased payer swaptions with a strike rate of\n3.75\n% and sold payer swaptions with a strike rate of\n4.25\n%.\n(5)\nIn October 2022, we entered into\nsix\ncross-currency swaps to exchange €\n612\nmillion for $\n600\nmillion maturing in October 2032. We redesignated $\n280\nmillion of three cross-currency swaps as net investment hedges in December 2023.\n(6)\nUSD fixed rate of\n5.625\n% and EUR weighted average fixed rate of\n4.681\n%.\n(7)\nUSD fixed rate of\n5.625\n% and EUR weighted average fixed rate of\n4.716\n%.\n(8)\nWeighted average forward GBP-USD exchange rate of\n1.30\n.\n(9)\nWeighted average exchange rates of\n1.27\nfor GBP-USD and\n0.86\nfor EUR-GBP.\nWe measure our derivatives at fair value and include the balances within 'Other assets, net' and 'Accounts payable and accrued expenses' on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe have agreements with each of our derivative counterparties containing provisions under which we could be declared in default on our derivative obligations if repayment of our indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default.\n76\nThe following table summarizes the amount of unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives and foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income (in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes the amount of gain (loss) on derivatives reclassified from AOCI (in thousands):\nWe expect to reclassify $\n8.0\nmillion from AOCI as a decrease to interest expense relating to interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions and $\n3.6\nmillion from AOCI to foreign currency gain relating to foreign currency forwards within the next twelve months.\n77\nThe following table details our foreign currency and derivative gains (losses), net included in income (in thousands):\n15.\nLessor\nOperating Leases\nAt December 31, 2023, we owned or held interests in\n13,458\nproperties. Of the\n13,458\nproperties,\n13,197\n, or\n98.1\n%, are single-client properties, and the remaining are multi-client properties. At December 31, 2023,\n193\nproperties were available for lease or sale. The majority of our leases are accounted for as operating leases.\nThe vast majority of our leases are net leases where our client pays or reimburses us for property taxes and assessments and carries insurance coverage for public liability, property damage, fire, and extended coverage.\nRent based on a percentage of our client's gross sales, or percentage rent, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was\n$\n14.8\nmillion, $\n14.9\nmillion, and $\n6.5\nmillion, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2023, minimum future annual rental revenue to be received on the operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):\n(1)\nRelated to\nsix\nproperties which are subject to direct financing leases and, therefore, revenue is recognized as rental income on the discounted cash flows of the lease payments. Amounts reflected are the cash rent on these respective properties.\nTwo\nproperties are subject to sales-type leases and, therefore, revenue is recognized as sales-type lease income on the discounted cash flows of the lease payments. Amounts reflected are the cash rent on these respective properties.\nNo individual client’s rental revenue, including percentage rents, represented more than 10% of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n78\n16.\nDistributions Paid and Payable\nWe pay monthly distributions to our common stockholders.\nThe following is a summary of monthly distributions paid per common share for the periods indicated below:\nAt December 31, 2023, a distribution of $\n0.2565\nper common share was payable and was paid in January 2024.\nAt December 31, 2022, a distribution of $\n0.2485\nper common share was payable and was paid in January 2023.\nThe following presents the federal income tax characterization of distributions paid or deemed to be paid per common share for the years:\n(1)\nThe amount distributed in 2021 includes the $\n2.060\ntax distribution of Orion shares, that occurred in conjunction with the Orion Divestiture on November 12, 2021, after our merger with VEREIT on November 1, 2021. The fair market value of these shares for tax distribution was determined to be $\n20.6272\nper share, which was calculated using the five-day volume weighted average share price after issuance.\n17.\nNet Income per Common Share\nBasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders, plus income attributable to dilutive shares and convertible common units for the period, by the weighted average number of common shares that would have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per common share computation to the denominator of the diluted net income per common share computation (shares in thousands):\n79\n18.\nSupplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes our supplemental cash flow information during the periods indicated below (in thousands):\n(1)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, includes £\n31.0\nmillion Sterling, converted at the applicable exchange rate on the date of transaction, for\none\nmortgage and $\n869.1\nmillion, estimated at fair value, for\nten\nmortgages from our merger with VEREIT.\n(2)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, includes\n734,458\ncommon partnership units of Realty Income L.P. that were issued in connection with the acquisition of\nnine\nproperties. For the year ended December 31, 2021, includes $\n1.8\nmillion for the issuance of\n56,400\nunits on November 1, 2021 that were a result of our merger with VEREIT, $\n20.4\nmillion for the issuance of\n300,604\nunits on November 30, 2021 that were a partial consideration for an acquisition of properties, and $\n16.6\nmillion for the issuance of\n240,586\nunits on December 30, 2021 that were issued to a new partner in connection with an industrial property contribution.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated balance sheets to the total of the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within our consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\n(1)\nIncluded within 'other assets, net' on our consolidated balance sheets (see note\n3, Supplemental Detail for Certain Components of Consolidated Balance Sheets\n). These amounts consist of cash that we are legally entitled to, but that is not immediately available to us. As a result, these amounts were considered restricted as of the dates presented.\n19.\nCommon Stock Incentive Plan\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors adopted, and in May 2021, stockholders approved, the Realty Income 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the \"2021 Plan\"). The 2021 Plan offers our directors, employees, and consultants an opportunity to own our stock and/or rights that will reflect our growth, development and financial success. Except as noted below, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock subject to options, stock purchase rights (\"SPR\"), stock appreciation rights (\"SAR\"), and other awards, will be no more than\n8.9\nmillion shares. The maximum number of shares that may be subject to options, SPR, SAR and other awards granted under the plan to any individual in any calendar year may not exceed\n3.2\nmillion, and the maximum aggregate amount of cash that may be paid in cash during any calendar year with respect to one or more shares payable in cash shall be $\n10.0\nmillion. The 2021 Plan replaced the Realty Income Corporation 2012 Incentive Award Plan (the\"2012 Plan\"), which was set to expire in March 2022 and from which no further awards have been granted. The disclosures below incorporate activity for both the 2012 Plan and the 2021 Plan.\n80\nIn connection with our merger with VEREIT, shares which remained available for issuance under the VEREIT, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan immediately prior to the closing of the merger (as adjusted by the Exchange Ratio) may be used for awards under the 2021 Plan and will not reduce the shares authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan, to the extent that awards using such shares (i) are permitted without stockholder approval under applicable stock exchange rules, (ii) are made only to VEREIT service providers or individuals who become Realty Income service providers following the date of the consummation of the merger, and (iii) are only granted under the 2021 Plan during the period commencing on the date of the consummation of the merger and ending on June 2, 2031. As a result,\n6.2\nmillion additional shares were available for issuance under the 2021 Plan.\nThe amount of share-based compensation costs recognized in 'General and administrative' in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income was $\n26.2\nmillion, $\n21.6\nmillion, and $\n16.2\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nAlso, in connection with the merger, each outstanding VEREIT, Inc. stock option and restricted stock unit that were unvested as of November 1, 2021 were converted into equivalent options and restricted stock units, in each case with respect to shares of the Company's common stock, using the equity award exchange ratio in accordance with the merger agreement. The converted awards issued by Realty Income have identical terms to the original VEREIT, Inc. award grant. On November 1, 2021, we issued\n0.4\nmillion shares of Realty Income common stock in settlement of equity awards that vested upon the separation of certain former-VEREIT employees and directors in connection with the merger. This issuance is excluded from the Restricted Stock Units and Stock Options sections below, as the awards were not granted under the 2021 Plan. The aggregate fair value of the converted awards was $\n71.6\nmillion, of which i.) $\n44.0\nmillion related to pre-combination services and is included in the consideration transferred in the merger ii.) $\n25.6\nmillion of expense was recognized during November in merger and integration-related costs related to the acceleration of vesting upon the separation of certain employees in connection with the merger, and iii.) $\n2.0\nmillion will be amortized through general and administrative expenses over the remaining vesting term for former VEREIT, Inc. employees who were retained by Realty Income. The following disclosures are inclusive of converted awards for former VEREIT employees continuing as employees of Realty Income, which are reflected as grants, as the replacement awards represent newly issued awards settled in Realty Income common shares.\nIn connection with the Orion Divestiture, each stock option, restricted stock unit and performance award outstanding at November 12, 2021 was entitled to an equitable adjustment equal to the ratio of the five-day volume weighted average per-share price of Realty Income common stock prior to the Orion Divestiture divided by the five-day volume weighted average per-share of Realty Income common stock following the Orion Divestiture, resulting in an adjustment factor of approximately\n1.002342\n. The equitable adjustment was considered a modification in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718,\nCompensation-Stock Compensation\n. As a result, we compared the fair value of each award immediately prior to the equitable adjustment to the fair value immediately after the equitable adjustment to measure incremental compensation cost, if any. The equitable adjustment did not result in any incremental fair value. Therefore, no stock-based compensation expense was recorded as of result of the modification. The following disclosures are inclusive of these adjustments, which has been labeled 'Equitable adjustment - Orion Divestiture' throughout.\nA.    Restricted Stock\nThe following table summarizes our common stock grant activity:\n(1)\nGrant date fair value.\n(2)\nOur restricted stock awards granted to employees vest over a service periods not exceeding\nfour-years\n. Additionally effective November 1, 2022, and applied retroactively for all outstanding awards, we have a retirement provision whereby the vesting date for eligible participants is accelerated based on certain criteria.\n81\nThe vesting schedule for shares granted to non-employee directors is as follows:\n•\nFor directors with less than\nsix years\nof service at the date of grant, shares vest in\n33.33\n% annual increments upon re-election to the Board at each of the\nthree\nAnnual Meetings of Stockholders following the grant date;\n•\nFor directors with\nsix years\nof service at the date of grant, shares vest in\n50\n% annual increments upon re-election to the Board at each of the\ntwo\nAnnual Meetings of Stockholders following the grant date;\n•\nFor directors with\nseven years\nof service at the date of grant, shares are\n100\n% vested upon re-election to the Board in the following year; and\n•\nFor directors with\neight\nor more years of service at the date of grant, there is immediate vesting as of the date the shares of stock are granted.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, we granted\n40,000\n,\n40,000\n, and\n36,000\ntotal shares of restricted stock granted to the independent members of our Board of Directors in connection with our annual awards in May 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, in November 2021, we granted\n8,000\nshares of restricted stock to the new members of our Board of Directors, which vest in equal parts over a\nthree-year\nservice period. In connection with our annual awards,\n20,000\n,\n20,000\n, and\n24,000\nshares vested immediately and\n20,000\n,\n20,000\n, and\n12,000\nshares vest in equal parts over a\nthree-year\nservice period for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the remaining unamortized share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock totaled $\n14.9\nmillion, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period of each applicable award. The amount of share-based compensation is based on the fair value of the stock at the grant date. We define the grant date as the date the recipient and Realty Income have a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the award, and the recipient of the grant begins to benefit from, or be adversely affected by, subsequent changes in the price of the shares.\nB.    Restricted Stock Units\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, and in connection with our merger with VEREIT Inc., we also granted restricted stock units that primarily vest over service periods of\nthree\nor\nfour-years\nand have the same economic rights as shares of restricted stock:\n(1)\nGrant date fair value.\n(2)\nEffective with the Orion Divestiture on November 12, 2021, outstanding equity awards were adjusted by a conversion ratio of\n1.002342\nper one Realty Income share then held.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the remaining share-based compensation expense related to the restricted stock units totaled $\n1.1\nmillion\nand is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. The amount of share-based compensation for the restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock at the grant date. The expense amortization period for restricted stock units is the lesser of the\nfour-year\nservice period or the period over which the awardee reaches the qualifying retirement age. For employees who have already met the qualifying retirement age, restricted stock units are fully expensed at the grant date.\n82\nC.    Performance Shares\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, we granted annual performance share awards, as well as dividend equivalent rights, to our executive officers.\nThe number of performance shares that vest for each of the three years is based on the achievement of the following performance goals:\nThe annual performance shares are earned based on our performance related to our metrics above, and vest\n50\n% on the first and second January 1 after the end of the\nthree-year\nperformance period, subject to continued service. The performance period for the 2021 performance awards began on January 1, 2021 and ended on December 31, 2023. The performance period for the 2022 performance awards began on January 1, 2022 and will end on December 31, 2024. The performance period for the 2023 performance awards began on January 1, 2023 and will end on December 31, 2025.\nOn November 15, 2021, the Compensation Committee approved a one-time grant of performance share awards and a one-time cash bonus to certain of our named executives in connection with the completion of our merger with VEREIT and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Orion Divestiture (the \"VEREIT Transaction\"). The awards were made to reward the executives for the successful consummation of the VEREIT Transaction and were intended to retain and motivate the executives to achieve optimal synergies and incentivize further growth from the merger. The performance shares were earned based on our performance related to Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (\"AFFO\") accretion (\n50\n% weighting) and general and administrative expense synergies (\n50\n% weighting), and vested\n50\n% upon the completion of the performance period.\nThe remaining\n50\n% vested on the\none-year\nanniversary of the completion of the applicable performance period. All vesting is subject to continued service. The performance period was\none year\nfor the AFFO accretion targets from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, and was\ntwo years\nfor the general and administrative expense synergies from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023.\nThe fair value of the performance shares was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the one-time performance shares was based on the fair value of our common stock at the grant date and is dependent on the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant.\nThe following table summarizes our performance share grant activity, inclusive of annual performance shares and the one-time performance shares related to the merger with VEREIT:\n(1)\nGrant date fair value.\n(2)\nEffective with the Orion Divestiture on November 12, 2021, outstanding equity awards were adjusted by a conversion ratio of\n1.002342\nper one Realty Income share then held.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the remaining share-based compensation expense related to the performance shares totaled $\n17.4\nmillion\nand is being recognized on a tranche-by-tranche basis over the service period.\n83\nD.    Stock Options\nIn connection with our merger with VEREIT in 2021,\n709,426\nstock options were converted with a weighted average exercise price of $\n53.80\nper option. There were no outstanding stock options prior to the VEREIT merger, and no additional stock options have since been granted.\nThe fair value of the stock options as of their grant date is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of assumptions including expected terms, expected volatility, dividend yield and risk-free rate.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had\n28,343\noutstanding nonvested stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $\n54.50\nper option. Their weighted average remaining contractual term is\n4.8\nyears.\nCompensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period described above. During the years ended December 31, 2023, we recorded\nno\nexpense related to stock options. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded less than $\n0.1\nmillion of expense related to stock options. As of December 31, 2023, there was\nno\nunamortized expense relating to our outstanding stock options.\n20.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are party to various legal actions which we believe are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business. We believe that the outcome of the proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had commitments of $\n32.7\nmillion, which primarily relate to re-leasing costs, recurring capital expenditures, and non-recurring building improvements. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, we had committed $\n740.0\nmillion under construction contracts related to development projects, which have estimated rental revenue commencement dates between January 2024 and January 2025.\nWe have certain properties that are subject to ground leases, which are accounted for as operating leases.\nAt December 31, 2023, minimum future rental payments for the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions):\n(1\n)\nThe discount rates are specific for individual leases primarily based on the lease term. The range of discount rates used to calculate the present value of the operating lease payments is\n0.94\n% to\n6.42\n% and for finance lease payments is\n1.14\n% to\n6.21\n%. The weighted average discount rate was derived from estimated incremental borrowing rates based on our credit quality, as we did not have any borrowings at the balance sheet date with comparable terms to our lease agreements. At December 31, 2023, the weighted average discount rate for operating leases is\n3.66\n% and the weighted average remaining lease term is\n23.1\nyears. At December 31, 2023, the weighted average discount rate for finance leases is\n3.47\n% and the weighted average remaining lease term is\n22.6\nyears.\n21.\nSubsequent Events\nA.     Dividends\nIn January 2024, we declared a dividend of $\n0.2565\nper share to our common stockholders, which was paid in February 2024. In addition, in February 2024, we declared a dividend of $\n0.2565\n, which will be paid in March 2024.\n84\nB.     Agreement and Plan of Merger\nOn January 23, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Spirit in an all-stock transaction. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the transaction was subject to the approval of Spirit’s stockholders and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nPursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, (i) each outstanding share of Spirit common stock, par value $\n0.05\nper share (other than the Excluded Common Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) automatically converted into\n0.762\nof a newly issued share of our common stock, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger Agreement, and cash in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) each outstanding share of Spirit’s\n6.000\n% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share,converted into the right to receive one share of newly issued Realty Income\n6.000\n% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, having substantially the same terms as the Spirit Series A Preferred Stock.\nIn connection with our merger with Spirit, we completed the $\n2.7\nbillion exchange in principal of outstanding notes issued by Spirit Realty, L.P. (“Spirit OP”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company following the Merger, for new notes issued by Realty Income and entered into $\n800.0\nmillion and $\n500.0\nmillion term loan agreements, which provide for the assumption of Spirit OP's existing term loan agreements.\nDue to the close proximity of the acquisition date and the Company's filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete, and therefore we are unable to disclose the information required by ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n. Such information will be included in the Company's subsequent Form 10-Q.\nC.    Notes Issuance\nIn January 2024, we issued $\n450.0\nmillion of\n4.750\n% senior unsecured notes due February 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), and $\n800.0\nmillion of\n5.125\n% senior unsecured notes due February 2034 (the “2034 Notes”). The public offering price for the 2029 Notes was\n99.225\n% of the principal amount for an effective annual yield to maturity of\n4.923\n%, and the public offering price for the 2034 Notes was\n98.910\n% of the principal amount for an effective annual yield to maturity of\n5.265\n%. Interest on the 2029 Notes and the 2034 Notes is paid semi-annually.\nD.    ATM Forward Offerings\nAs of February 20, 2024, ATM forward agreements for a total of\n10.8\nmillion shares remain unsettled with total expected net proceeds of approximately $\n605\nmillion of which\n4.6\nmillion shares were executed in January 2024.\n85"

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs of and for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nBased on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2023 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.\nManagement has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control--Integrated Framework (2013)” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. KPMG LLP has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nSubmitted on February 21, 2024 by,\nSumit Roy, President, Chief Executive Officer\nJonathan Pong, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n86\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk."
