    "text": "General\nWe are a leading global manufacturer in the design and production of technologically advanced, high-quality, integrated containment and delivery systems for injectable drugs and healthcare products. Our products include a variety of primary packaging, containment solutions, reconstitution and transfer systems, and drug delivery systems, as well as contract manufacturing, analytical lab services and integrated solutions. Our customers include the leading biologic, generic, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies in the world. Our top priority is delivering quality products that meet the exact product specifications and quality standards customers require and expect. This focus on quality includes a commitment to excellence in manufacturing, scientific and technical expertise and management, which enables us to partner with our customers in order to deliver safe, effective drug products to patients quickly and efficiently.\nBusiness Segments\nOur business operations are organized into two reportable segments, Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products.\nProprietary Products Segment\nOur Proprietary Products reportable segment offers proprietary packaging, containment and drug delivery products, along with analytical lab services and other integrated services and solutions, primarily to biologic, generic and pharmaceutical drug customers. Our packaging products include stoppers and seals for injectable packaging systems, which are designed to help ensure drug compatibility and stability with active drug products, while also supporting operational efficiency for customers. This product portfolio also includes syringe and cartridge components, including custom solutions for the specific needs of injectable drug applications, as well as administration systems that can enhance the safe delivery of drugs through advanced reconstitution, mixing and transfer technologies. We also provide films, coatings, washing, vision inspection and sterilization processes and services to enhance the quality of packaging components and mitigate the risk of contamination and compatibility issues.\nThis segment’s product portfolio also includes drug containment solutions, including Crystal Zenith, a cyclic olefin polymer, in the form of vials, syringes and cartridges. These products can provide a high-quality solution to glass incompatibility issues and can stand up to cold storage environments, while reducing the risk of breakage that exists with glass. In addition, we offer a variety of self-injection devices, designed to address the need to provide at-home delivery of injectable therapies. These devices are patient-centric technologies that are easy-to-use and can be combined with connected health technologies that have the potential to increase adherence.\nIn addition to our Proprietary Products product portfolio, we provide our customers with a range of integrated solutions, including analytical lab services, pre-approval primary packaging support and engineering development, regulatory expertise, and after-sales technical support. Offering the combination of primary packaging components, containment solutions, and drug delivery devices, as well as a broad range of integrated services, helps to position us as a leader in the integrated containment and delivery of injectable medicines.\nThis reportable segment has manufacturing facilities in North and South America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, with affiliated companies in Mexico and Japan. Please refer to Item 2,\n, for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites.\n4\nContract-Manufactured Products Segment\nOur Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment serves as a fully integrated business, focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex devices, primarily for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers. These products include a variety of custom contract-manufacturing and assembly solutions, which use such technologies as multi-component molding, in-mold labeling, ultrasonic welding, clean room molding and device assembly. We manufacture customer-owned components and devices used in surgical, diagnostic, ophthalmic, injectable, and other drug delivery systems, as well as consumer products.\nWe have vast expertise in product design and development, including in-house mold design, process design and validation and high-speed automated assemblies.\nThis reportable segment has manufacturing operations in North America and Europe. Please refer to Item 2,\n, for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites.\nInternational\nWe have significant operations outside of the United States (“U.S.”), which are managed through the same business segments as our U.S. operations – Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. Sales outside of the U.S. accounted for 57.7% of our consolidated net sales in 2021.\nAlthough the general business processes are similar to the domestic business, international operations are exposed to additional risks. These risks include currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. Dollar (“USD”), multiple tax jurisdictions and, particularly in South America, Eastern Europe, Israel and the Middle East, uncertain or changing regulatory regimes, or political and social issues, that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products.\nSee further discussion of our international operations, the risks associated with our international operations, and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in Part I, Item 1A,\n;\nPart II, Item 7,\nunder the caption\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources;\nPart II, Item 7A,\n;\nNote 1,\nunder the captions\nFinancial Instruments\nand\nForeign Currency Translation;\nand Note 11,\n.\nRaw Materials\nWe use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products: elastomers, aluminum and plastic. Elastomers include both synthetic and natural materials. We currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers.\nWe employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments, which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply. Due to regulatory control over our production processes, sole source availability, and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers, we rely on single-source suppliers for many critical raw materials. We generally purchase certain raw materials in the open market. This strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production or distribution problem. These risks are managed, when and where possible, by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites, rigorous quality control systems, surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production or distribution.\n5\nIntellectual Property\nIntellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, is important to our business. We own or license intellectual property rights, including know-how and issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries, that relate to various aspects of our products. In 2021, more than 200 patents were issued to West across the globe. Some key value-added and proprietary products and processes are exclusively licensed from Daikyo. Our intellectual property rights help protect our products and are critical to the growth of our business.\nWorking Capital\nWe are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements. In addition, some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders, which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption. For a more detailed discussion of working capital, please refer to the discussion in Part II, Item 7,\nunder the caption\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resource\ns.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Accordingly, the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., Europe and other countries, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the European Medicines Agency and the National Medical Products Administration (China). Regulatory authorities, including regulatory review and oversight, can impact the time and cost associated with the development and continued availability of our products, and they have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against West, such as product recalls.\nChanges in tax policy or trade regulations, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations did not require material capital expenditures in 2021, and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position in 2022 as compared to prior periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see \"Item 1A -\n\". There were no required material capital expenditures for adherence to our government-led regulatory standards in our facilities in 2021 outside the normal course of business and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2022.\nWest is also subject to various federal and state laws, and laws outside the United States, concerning fraud and abuse, global anti-corruption, and export control. With the recent increased regulations, we remain committed as a company to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to our business.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various national, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There were no required material capital expenditures for environmental controls in our facilities in 2021 and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2022.\n6\nMarketing\nOur Proprietary Products customers primarily include many of the major biologic, generic, and pharmaceutical drug companies in the world, which incorporate our components and other offerings into their injectable products for distribution to the point of care and ultimate end-user, the patient.\nOur Contract-Manufactured Products customers include many of the world’s largest pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies. Contract-Manufactured Products components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly.\nOur products and services are sold and distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network, with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors.\nOur ten largest customers accounted for 41.4% of our consolidated net sales in 2021, but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales. Please refer to Note 3,\n, and Note 19,\n, for additional information on our consolidated net sales.\nCompetition\nWith our range of proprietary technologies, we compete with several companies across our Proprietary Products product lines. Competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance, quality, regulatory, and scientific expertise, along with total cost.\nIn addition, there are a number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components, including a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers who are also potential customers of our medical devices and components. We compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management, as well as our knowledge of, and experience in, compliance with regulatory requirements.\nWe have specialized knowledge of container closure components, which is integral to developing delivery systems. With our range of proprietary technologies, we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices, including suppliers of prefillable syringes, auto-injectors, safety needles, and other proprietary systems.\nWe seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition by serving as an integrated drug containment and delivery systems global supplier that can provide pre-approval primary packaging support and engineering development, analytical lab services and integrated solutions, regulatory expertise, and after-sale technical support. Customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites.\nOur Contract-Manufactured Products business operates in very competitive markets for its products. The competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global assembly manufacturers. Given the cost pressures they face, many of our customers look to reduce costs by sourcing from low-cost locations. We seek to differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capabilities and by employing new technologies such as high-speed automated assembly, insert-molding, multi-shot precision molding, and expertise with multiple-piece closure systems.\nResearch and Development Activities\nWe maintain our own research-scale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development. Our quality control, regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and delivery systems.\n7\nCommercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years. New products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices, and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period.\nWe continue to pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes, injectable containers, advanced injection, and safety and administration systems.\nWe also continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition, licensing, partnering or development of products, services and technologies.\nHuman Ca\npital\nManagement\nOur People\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 10,065 people, excluding contractors and temporary workers, in our operations throughout the world. During 202\n1, West hired approximately 3,100 new team members and experienced an attrition rate of 23%. The following table presents the approximate\npercentage of our employees by region:\nAs of December 31, 2021, the following table presents the approximate percentage of our employees by business unit:\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had the following global gender demographics:\n8\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe actively foster an inclusive and collaborative culture and positive employee experiences for our team members so that they know that different views and perspectives are welcomed and valued at West. We are convinced that this approach brings forth innovation, learning and growth for our team members on a global basis. The Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and the executive team members review diversity and inclusion objectives throughout the year to ensure continuous focus and improvement. As of December 31, 2021, three out of the nine members of West's Leadership Team are women, with five out of the nine members being women and/or people of color.\nTraining, Compliance and Talent Development\nWe strongly encourage our team members to engage in continuous learning, and we provide development opportunities and build talent from within. We offer resources such as our tuition reimbursement program and our online learning catalog, with approximately 40,000 courses available. We centrally manage and organize on-the-job training, instructor-led trainings and online trainings in many different languages and topics through our one global Learning Management System, where we tracked more than 50,000 training completions during 2021 from our team members around the globe.\nOur team members live the values of our ethical culture. They are responsible for adhering to our core values as they work together to support our mission to improve patient lives. West’s Code of Business Conduct, available in multiple languages on westpharma.com, provides guidance to our team members on appropriate conduct. Every team member is required to undergo Code of Business Conduct and respect in the workplace training annually.\nOur focus on talent acquisition, performance management, resource planning and leadership assessment are strongly aligned with our diversity and inclusion strategies. We understand that diversity leads to greater innovation, more opportunities, better access to talent and stronger business performance\n.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWest is committed to providing fair and competitive compensation and benefits programs to attract, retain and reward high-performing team members at all levels. We offer a comprehensive total rewards program to support the health, financial and home-life needs of our team members. Total Rewards at West are defined as the value of the Compensation and Benefits programs offered to employees, which aim to reflect the value of the job and the contribution of the individual, while linking employees’ performance to business and personal results. Based on country of employment, West may provide health care and retirement savings programs as well as paid time off, flexible work schedules, a Global Employee Assistance Program and an Employee Stock Purchase Program.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nThe health and safety of our team members has always been both a top priority and a cultural value. West's commitment to the safety of our teams starts at the top and is driven throughout our business by every level of management and by every team member across the globe. West has a Health, Safety, and Environment (\"HSE\") Executive Council consisting of C-suite and executive operations leaders to monitor and guide our HSE process. West’s global HSE team is also a critical component in leading the safety efforts at our sites. Each manufacturing location has dedicated and trained HSE professionals, responsible for general safety oversight at the site. Our Recordable Injury Rate in 2021 was 0.83 per 100 employees. Our HSE and employee well-being focus can also be seen in our continued proactive global response to the COVID-19 pandemic which has included engaging with experts and reviewing applicable guidance, training and active screening of employees for COVID-19 illness; enhanced gowning and cleaning protocols at all locations; mask requirements for in-person employees, vendors and contractors; eliminating non-critical international and domestic business travel; requiring or permitting many administrative and support personnel to work-from-home; modifying production operations to facilitate social distancing; and regular communications regarding COVID-19 protocols, precautions and information for both on and off the job use.\n9\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Commitment\nWest has been committed to ESG issues for many years. During 2021, we heightened the awareness of our ESG issues by expanding our education and communication regarding our ESG program and initiatives. Additionally, we enhanced the governance structure of our ESG program by introducing a new cross-functional ESG team which has been working with senior management, our board and other stakeholders to develop an ESG framework that is aligned with our corporate mission, vision and values. We expect our strategy to focus on areas such as talent attraction, retention and engagement (including diversity and inclusion); a climate strategy that incorporates renewable energy and reduced emissions standards; developing a more sustainable, more diverse and more responsible supply chain; research and development that focuses on issues of sustainability; and, reduction of waste in operational processes. These areas of focus are in addition to our commitments on safety and quality. Additionally, our philanthropic programs are an essential element of our corporate citizenship especially as we focus on the areas of children’s health; access to healthcare; and science, technology, engineering and math education. We solicit constant input from our employees on ways to improve in these and other ESG areas and see continued progress in these areas as critical to maintaining an engaged and responsible workforce.\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain a website at\nwww.westpharma.com\n.

    "text": "Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider and carefully read all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report and in our other public filings. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your original investment. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nOur disclosure and analysis in this Form 10-K contains some forward-looking statements that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts. We also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have attempted, wherever possible, to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “plan,” “anticipate” and other words and phrases of similar meaning. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, new products, future performance or results of current or anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign-exchange rates, economic effects, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results.\nMany of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties, including, without limitation, the risks set forth below. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements.\nUnless required by applicable securities law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K to the SEC.\n11\nGlobal and Economic Risks\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other public health epidemics.\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with a pandemic, or outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population, including the COVID‑19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets and has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures. Notwithstanding our level of continued operations, the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health concerns in the future, may have negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, which may compress our margins, including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries and could result in an economic downturn. Any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, demand for our products, services, and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products, services and raw materials.\nIn addition, the ability of our employees and our suppliers' and customers' employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19, or as a result of the control measures noted above, which may significantly hamper our production throughout the supply chain and constrict distribution channels. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration of the pandemic, variants of the virus and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate its effects. We are unable to predict the potential future impact that the COVID‑19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUnauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.\nOur systems and networks, as well as those of our customers, suppliers, service providers, and banks, have and may in the future become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches which, in turn, could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our company, our employees or our customers, as well as disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties. Additionally, our systems are subject to regulation to preserve the privacy of certain data held on those systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems, in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. If we cannot comply with regulations or prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our or our customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses. We may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance our systems, or to try to prevent or remediate any such attacks. Modifying or enhancing our systems may result in unanticipated or prolonged disruption events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\n12\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions.\nThe current uncertainty in the global economy, including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the U.S., Europe, and emerging markets in Asia and South America, may negatively affect our operating results. Examples of the effects of these global economic challenges include: our suppliers’ and our customers’ inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates; reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the near-term or long-term or due to liquidity difficulties; reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers; reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers; our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices; insolvency of suppliers or customers; inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products; and increased expenses due to growing global taxation of corporate profits or revenues or changes in, or expirations of, a country’s tax laws or regulations. Our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region. If economic and market conditions in the U.S. or Europe, or in emerging markets, weaken further, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a global company with significant revenues and earnings generated internationally, which exposes us to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as well as political and economic risks.\nA significant portion of our revenues and earnings are generated internationally. Sales outside of the U.S. accounted for 57.7% of our consolidated net sales in 2021 and we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the U.S. and we intend to continue our expansion into emerging and/or faster-growing international markets.\nThe functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities, which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Foreign governmental policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations. Given the unpredictability and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, ongoing or unusual volatility may adversely impact our business and financial conditions.\nIn order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into hedging arrangements, including the use of financial derivatives. There can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain hedges of these currency risks, or that our hedges will be effective, which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nA substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. In addition, we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\n13\nLIBOR reform may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur variable-rate debt, which includes our senior unsecured, multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement dated as of March 28, 2019 (the “Credit Agreement”), and its accompanying Incremental Facility Amendment dated as of December 30, 2019 (the “Term Loan”), currently use the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is currently calculated and published for various currencies and periods by the benchmark’s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\"IBA\"), which is regulated for such purposes by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"). On March 5, 2021, the IBA confirmed that it would cease the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the publication of all other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease or be deemed unrepresentative after June 30, 2023.\nAccordingly, in the near future LIBOR will cease being a widely used benchmark interest rate. The current and any future reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past, including during the transition period. The Credit Agreement Amendment contemplates a procedure for transitioning from LIBOR upon the occurrence of specified events. Nevertheless, the consequences of these market developments cannot be entirely predicted and a transition from LIBOR, even if administered consistent with the credit facility’s provisions, could increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nNo assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends.\nWe have historically paid dividends. However, there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future. The actual declaration and payment of future dividends, the amount of any such dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, if any, are subject to determination by our Board of Directors each quarter after its review of our then-current strategy, applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position, among other things. Our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties, including: deterioration of our financial performance or position; inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants; an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash; and the business judgment of the Board of Directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in our best interest.\nIndustry Risks\nOur sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products. If the drug products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system or are reconfigured to require less frequent dosing, our sales and profitability could suffer.\nOur business depends to a substantial extent on customers’ continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection. If (i) our customers fail to continue to sell, develop and deploy injectable products; (ii) our customers reconfigure their drug product or develop new drug products requiring less frequent dosing; or (iii) we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods, our sales and profitability may suffer.\n14\nIf we are unable to provide comparative value advantages, timely fulfill customer orders, or resist pricing pressure, we will have to reduce our prices, which may reduce our profit margins.\nWe compete with several companies across our major product lines. Because of the special nature of these products, competition is based primarily on product design and performance, although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost-control programs across their operations. Companies often compete on the basis of price. We aim to differentiate ourselves from our competition by being a “full-service, value-added” global supplier that is able to provide pre-sale compatibility studies, engineering support, and other services and sophisticated post-sale technical support on a global basis. However, we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors. If we are unable to resist or offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our value-added services, improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, or if we have to reduce our prices, our sales and profitability may suffer.\nConsolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.\nThe pharmaceutical and healthcare industries continue to experience a significant amount of consolidation. As a result of this consolidation, competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased. In addition, group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers. Further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products.\nThe medical technology industry is very competitive and customer demands and/or new products in the marketplace could cause a reduction in demand.\nThe medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes, and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold. We face this competition from a wide range of companies, including large medical device companies, some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets. In some instances, competitors, including pharmaceutical companies, also offer, or are attempting to develop, alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered via their own, or without, a medical device. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies (such as needle-free injection technology) may reduce customer demand for our products or render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In addition, any failure or inability to meet increased customer quality expectations could cause a reduction in demand.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nDisruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation, performance or financial condition.\nWe have manufacturing sites throughout the world. In some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or only a few of our plants. The functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control, including, without limitation: extreme weather or longer-term climatic changes; natural disasters; pandemic; war; accidental damage; disruption to the supply of material or services; product quality and safety issues; systems failure; workforce actions; or environmental matters. There is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and, therefore, materially adversely affect our reputation, performance or financial condition.\n15\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nWe conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world. Our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy (including our plan to continue expanding into emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside of the U.S.) are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country, and include: transportation delays and interruptions; political and economic instability and disruptions, including the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union; imposition of duties and tariffs; import and export controls; the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; labor strikes and/or disputes; and potentially adverse tax consequences. Limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the U.S. could also create exposure. In addition, we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations, or comply with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject, in the event that these laws or regulations change. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products or decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDisruptions in the supply of key raw materials could adversely impact our operations.\nWe generally purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, many components and raw materials are available and/or purchased only from a single supplier. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products and the availability of such raw materials, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or raw materials or do so without excessive cost. As a result, a reduction or interruption in supply, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nRaw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability. If raw material and/or energy prices increase, and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers, our profitability and financial condition may suffer.\nWe use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products: elastomers (which include synthetic and natural material), aluminum and plastic. In addition, our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel, heat and cool our operations. Supply and demand factors, which are beyond our control, generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs. If we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers, our profitability, and thus our financial condition, may be adversely affected. The prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile. For example, the prices of certain commodities, particularly petroleum-based raw materials, have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes, affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic. While we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases, historically there has been a time delay between raw material and/or energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products. In some circumstances, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors.\n16\nIf we are not timely or successful in new-product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi-component systems, our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected.\nOur growth partly depends on new-product innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multi-component systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications. Product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control, including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products. The ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional, operational, clinical, and economic viability of our products. In addition, the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of commercialization of customers’ products in Crystal Zenith vials, syringes and cartridges. Delays, interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing new-product innovations or proprietary multi-component systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income. In addition, adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may not succeed in finding and completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have historically engaged in acquisition activity, and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions, such as joint ventures or investments in other entities. We may be unable to identify suitable targets, opportunistic or otherwise, for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future. If we identify a suitable candidate, our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements. Strategic transactions involve risks, including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate (as applicable), financial reporting, disparate technologies, and personnel of acquired companies, joint ventures or related companies; managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments; the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; the potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies, joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments; and potentially other unknown risks. We may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions. Strategic transactions may be expensive, time consuming and may strain our resources. Strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, one-time write-offs of goodwill, additional carrying costs of patent or trademark portfolios, and amortization expenses of other intangible assets. In addition, strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.\nProduct defects could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe design, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical packaging and medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals. Please refer to Note 3,\n, for the discussion of the voluntary recall of our Vial2Bag\n®\nproduct line.\n17\nA loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations.\nOur future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key employees, including our executive officers and individuals in technical, marketing, sales, and research positions. Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons with specialized skills, can be intense. Our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location and work environment. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees, our business could be adversely affected. Although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations. In addition, because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce. Our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees.\nOur results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations\n.\nWe provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods. This guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K and in our other public filings and public statements, and is based on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance. Our guidance may not always be accurate. If, in the future, our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with Daikyo or the agreements are terminated early or not renewed, we could lose license rights and access to certain product and technology that are important to our business.\nKey value-added and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate, Daikyo, including but not limited to, Crystal Zenith, FluroTec\n®\nand B2-coating technologies. Our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2027. However, if the agreements are terminated early or not renewed, our business could be adversely impacted. Please refer to Note 7,\n,\nfor information relating to the increase in our ownership interest in Daikyo in 2019.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to regulation by governments around the world, and if these regulations are not complied with, existing and future operations may be curtailed, and we could be subject to liability.\nAs a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. For example, the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., Europe and other countries, including the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and the National Medical Products Administration (China). Complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe global nature of our business also means legal and compliance risks, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade, environmental, competition, privacy, and other regulatory matters, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees.\n18\nProducts that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes, which make the timing and success of new-product commercialization difficult to predict.\nThe process of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and time-consuming. Historically, most medical devices that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce have been subject to the FDA’s 510(k) marketing approval process, which typically lasts from six to nine months. Supplemental or full pre-market approval reviews require a significantly longer period, delaying commercialization. Changes in regulation on a global scale must be monitored and actions taken to ensure ongoing compliance. Pharmaceutical products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to the FDA’s New Drug Application process, which typically takes a number of years to complete. Additionally, biotechnology products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to the FDA’s Biologics License Application process, which also typically takes a number of years to complete. Outside of the U.S., sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. The time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. There is no certainty that any regulatory approval may be obtained or maintained indefinitely, and our ability to launch products to the market and maintain market presence is not guaranteed.\nChanges in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business.\nAn effect of the governmental regulation of our medical devices and our customers’ drug products, devices, and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it difficult to change components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another supplier, due to the large amount of data and information that customers must generate to demonstrate that the components and devices are equivalent and pose no additional risk to the patient. The regulation of our medical devices and our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time. If the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the level of data and information needed to prove equivalency for a change from one supplier’s components or devices to those made by another, it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nIf we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete may be affected.\nOur patents, trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary products, information, technologies and processes. We also have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of third-party intellectual property. We may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations. There can be no assurance that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation, infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful. In addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our proprietary products in some countries. Failure to protect our intellectual property or successfully invalidate or defend against intellectual property protections of third parties could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, if relevant and effective patent protection is not available or has expired, we may not be able to prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours.\n19\nSignificant developments in U.S. policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nWe earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals may pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows.\nWe utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters. These rulings and agreements expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm and other adverse business consequences.\nIn addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we handle transactional and personal information worldwide.\nAs a result, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous, and sometimes conflicting laws, regulatory standards, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of business and personal data by us and on our behalf. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “EU GDPR”), the United Kingdom’s GDPR (the “UK GDPR”) and California’s Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (the \"CCPA\") impose obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. In addition, it is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. Furthermore, other states in the United States have enacted data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which become effective in 2023. Additionally, laws in certain jurisdictions require data localization and impose restrictions on the transfer of personal information across border. For example, the EU GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area without appropriate safeguards or other measures. If we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border privacy and security transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions against processing or transferring personal information from Europe or elsewhere.\n20\nCompliance with existing and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and may require changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal information on our behalf. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with obligations related to data privacy and security, we could face significant consequences, including, but not limited to, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities (e.g. investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections) or other entities or individuals, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight bans, damage to our reputation and credibility, or inability to process data or operate in certain jurisdictions, any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions around the world. The FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies, as well as their officers, directors, employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners and agents, from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state owned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable for corrupt or other illegal activities, even if we do not explicitly authorize them. While we have policies and procedures and internal controls to address compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that all of our employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies and laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. To the extent that we learn that any of our employees or third-party intermediaries, business partners or agents do not adhere to our policies, procedures, or internal controls, we are committed to taking appropriate remedial action. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our directors, officers, employees or third-party intermediaries, agents or business partners have or may have violated such laws, we may be required to investigate or to have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. Any violation of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, and criminal or civil sanctions, penalties, and fines, any of which may could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations, and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business.\nThe manufacturing of some of our products has involved, and may continue to involve, the use, transportation, storage, and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. This has exposed us in the past, and could expose us in the future, to risks of accidental contamination and events of non-compliance with environmental laws. Any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant.\n21\nHealthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in the U.S. or international healthcare systems could result in reduced demand for our products, as our sales depend, in part, on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for the costs of our products. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers, which can vary among public and private sources, may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction. Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the U.S. or abroad (for example, those under consideration in France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers’ products, which could in turn reduce the demand for our products.\nMoreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to global governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products. We will continue to evaluate healthcare reform, as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by healthcare legislation globally and that may potentially impact our business over time.\nThe uncertain effects of climate change and potential climate change legislation could lead to business interruption, significantly increased costs and/or other adverse consequences to our business.\nClimate change and potential climate change legislation may present risks to our operations, including business interruption, significantly increased costs and/or other adverse consequences to our business. Some of the potential impacts of climate change to our business include physical risks to our facilities, water and energy supply limitations or interruptions, disruptions to our supply chain and impairment of other resources. In addition, if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the U.S., Europe, Asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions, such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions, including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions, and our results of operations. Our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change, or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner. Additionally, suppliers’ added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases."

    "text": "OVERVIEW\nThe following discussion is intended to further the reader’s understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of our Company. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nFor the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year-over-year results, we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic net sales exclude the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures and translate the current-period reported sales of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than USD at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period. We may also refer to adjusted consolidated operating profit and adjusted consolidated operating profit margin, which exclude the effects of unallocated items. The unallocated items are not representative of ongoing operations, and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments, and other specifically-identified income or expense items. The re-measured results excluding effects from currency translation, the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures, and excluding the effects of unallocated items are not in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are incorporated in our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position.\nOur Operations\nWe are a leading global manufacturer in the design and production of technologically advanced, high-quality, integrated containment and delivery systems for injectable drugs and healthcare products. Our products include a variety of primary packaging, containment solutions, reconstitution and transfer systems, and drug delivery systems, as well as contract manufacturing, analytical lab services and integrated solutions. Our customers include the leading biologic, generic, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and additional medical device companies in the world. Our top priority is delivering quality products that meet the exact product specifications and quality standards customers require and expect. This focus on quality includes a commitment to excellence in manufacturing, scientific and technical expertise and management, which enables us to partner with our customers in order to deliver safe, effective drug products to patients quickly and efficiently.\nOur business operations are organized into two reportable segments, Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. Our Proprietary Products reportable segment offers proprietary packaging, containment and drug delivery products, along with analytical lab services and other integrated services and solutions, primarily to biologic, generic and pharmaceutical drug customers. Our Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment serves as a fully integrated business, focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex devices, primarily for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers. We also maintain collaborations to share technologies and market products with affiliates in Japan and Mexico.\n28\nImpact of COVID-19\nIt has been nearly two years since the COVID-19 pandemic began and there remains uncertainty around the long-term impact of the pandemic on the world economy. Our primary objectives have remained the same throughout the pandemic: to support the safety of our team members and their families and continue to support patients around the world. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our production facilities have continued to operate as they had prior to the pandemic, other than for enhanced safety measures intended to prevent the spread of the virus and higher levels of production at certain plant locations to meet additional customer demand. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remain strong. The remote working arrangements and travel restrictions imposed by various governments have had limited impact on our ability to maintain operations, as our manufacturing operations have generally been exempted from stay-at-home orders. However, we cannot predict the impact of the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic on future results due to a variety of factors, including the continued good health of our employees, the ability of suppliers to continue to operate and deliver, the ability of West and its customers to maintain operations, continued access to transportation resources, the changing needs and priorities of customers, any further government and/or public actions taken in response to the pandemic and ultimately the length of the pandemic. We will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in order to ensure the safety of our people and our ability to serve our customers and patients worldwide.\nComponents of and Key Factors Influencing Our Results of Operations\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. We believe the items discussed below provide insight into the factors that affect these key measures.\nNet Sales\nOur net sales results from the sale of goods or services and reflects the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nSeveral factors affect our reported net sales in any period, including product, payer and geographic sales mix, operational effectiveness, pricing realization, timing of orders and shipments, regulatory actions, competition, and business acquisitions that involve our customers or competitors.\nCost of goods and services sold and gross profit\nCost of goods and services sold includes personnel costs, manufacturing costs, raw materials and product costs, freight costs, depreciation, and facility costs associated with our manufacturing and warehouse facilities. Fluctuations in our cost of goods sold correspond with the fluctuations in sales units as well as inflationary and other market factors that influence our cost base.\nGross profit is calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold. Our gross profit is affected by product and geographic sales mix, realized pricing of our products, the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and the costs of materials used to make our products.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses relate to our investments in improvements to our manufacturing processes, product enhancements, and additional investments in our self-injection systems development, fluid transfer admixture devices, elastomeric packaging components, and formulation development.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Our research and development expenses fluctuate from period to period primarily based on the ongoing improvements to our manufacturing processes and product enhancements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs, incentive compensation, insurance, professional fees, and depreciation.\n29\nFinancial Performance Summary\nThe following tables present a reconciliation from U.S. GAAP to non-U.S. GAAP financial measures:\nDuring 2021, we recorded a tax benefit of $31.5 million associated with stock-based compensation.\nDuring 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $20.8 million associated with stock-based compensation.\nDuring 2019, we recorded a tax benefit of $10.3 million associated with stock-based compensation.\n30\n(1)  During 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a restructuring and severance related charge of $2.2 million and $7.0 million, respectively, to optimize certain organizational structure within the Company.

In both 2021 and 2020, we determined that normal-course lump-sum payments for our U.S. qualified, and non-qualified in 2020, defined benefit pension plan exceeded the threshold for settlement accounting under U.S. GAAP for the year.\n37\n2020 compared to 2019\nOther nonoperating (income) expense changed by $1.3 million in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the interest cost component of our net periodic benefit expense, partially offset by an increase in pension settlement charges. A pension settlement charge of $3.7 million was recorded in 2020, as we determined that normal-course lump-sum payments for each of our U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans exceeded the threshold for settlement accounting under U.S. GAAP for the year.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $107.2 million, $72.5 million, and $59.0 million for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and the effective tax rate was 14.3%, 18.1%, and 20.2%, respectively.\nDuring 2021, we recorded a tax benefit of $31.5 million associated with stock-based compensation, an increase from the tax benefit of $20.8 million associated with stock-based compensation in 2020, and a tax benefit of $18.5 million for prepayment of future royalties from one of our subsidiaries, which both contributed to the effective tax rate decline from 18.1% in 2020 to 14.3% in 2021.\nDuring 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $20.8 million associated with stock-based compensation and incurred less tax on international operations versus the prior year.\nDuring 2019, we recorded a net tax benefit of $0.3 million due to the impact of federal law changes enacted during the year, as well as a tax benefit of $10.3 million associated with stock-based compensation.\nPlease refer to Note 17,\n, for further discussion of our income taxes.\nEquity in Net Income of Affiliated Companies\nEquity in net income of affiliated companies represents the contribution to earnings from our 49% ownership interest in Daikyo, which increased from 25% during the fourth quarter of 2019, and our 49% ownership interest in four companies majority-owned by a long-time partner located in Mexico. Please refer to Note 7,\n, for further discussion. Equity in net income of affiliated companies was $20.1 million, $17.4 million, and $8.9 million for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by $2.7 million, or 15.5%, in 2021, primarily due to favorable operating results at Daikyo. Equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by $8.5 million, or 95.5%, in 2020, primarily due to favorable operating results at Daikyo and the increased ownership of Daikyo starting in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n38\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents cash flow data for the years ended December 31:\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n2021 compared to 2020\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $111.5 million in 2021, primarily due to improved operating results, offset by increases in working capital and timing of tax payments in 2021.\n2020 compared to 2019\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $105.3 million in 2020, primarily due to improved operating results and changes in assets and liabilities.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\n2021 compared to 2020\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $73.6 million in 2021, primarily due to increases in capital expenditures in 2021 to meet customer demand.\n2020 compared to 2019\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $48.5 million in 2020, primarily due to 2019 investing activities that did not recur in 2020, such as our increase in Daikyo ownership and the acquisition of our South Korea distributor in 2019. These reductions in investing activities were offset in 2020 by an increase in capital expenditures to support our increased customer demands.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\n2021 compared to 2020\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $31.0 million in 2021, primarily due to an increase in purchases under our share repurchases program.\n2020 compared to 2019\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $100.3 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in purchases under our share repurchases program and given 2019 included new long-term borrowings while no such new borrowings occurred in 2020.\n39\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of:\nCash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.\nCash and cash equivalents –\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2021 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in high-quality, short-term investments. The cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2021 included $422.0 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the U.S. and $340.6 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the U.S. In response to the 2017 Tax Act, we reevaluated our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through 2017 (with the exception of China and Mexico) and decided that those profits were no longer permanently reinvested. As of January 1, 2018, we reasserted indefinite reinvestment related to all post-2017 unremitted earnings in all of our foreign subsidiaries. In general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is de minimis, and that position has not changed subsequent to the one-time transition tax under the 2017 Tax Act, except as noted above. Accordingly, no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of approximately $635.3 million of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S., as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested. Further, it is impracticable for us to estimate any future tax costs for any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities associated with our indefinite reinvestment assertion, because the actual tax liability, if any, would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws, exchange rates, circumstances existing when there is a repatriation, sale or liquidation, or other factors.\nWorking capital -\nWorking capital at December 31, 2021 increased by $277.6 million, or 31.9%, as compared to December 31, 2020, which includes an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $13.3 million. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories, and total current liabilities increased by $162.6 million, $121.0 million, $69.3 million, and $108.0 million, respectively. The increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales activity. The increase in inventories that occurred in the period was to ensure we have sufficient inventory on hand to support the needs of our customers. The increase in total current liabilities was primarily due to increases in current debt, accounts payable, accrued salaries, wages and benefits, accrued expenses, and accrued rebates.\nDebt and credit facilities -\nThe $2.2 million decrease in total debt at December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020, resulted from debt repayments under our Term Loan.\nOur sources of liquidity include our Credit Facility. At December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2021, the borrowing capacity available under the Credit Facility, including outstanding letters of credit of $2.4 million, was $297.6 million. We do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds. Please refer to Note 10,\n, for further discussion of our Credit Facility.\n40\nPursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants, and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2022.\nWe believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with availability under our Credit Facility, will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations to continue to meet customer demand.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nContractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities are expected to result in cash payments in future periods, and include the following material items:\n•\nOur business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers, including for the purchase of raw materials\nand finished goods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2021, our outstanding unconditional contractual commitments, including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods, amounted to $93.6 million, of which $48.3 million is due to be paid in 2022. These purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business. The Company previously entered into a material supply agreement for butyl polymers used as a principal raw material in a broad range of the Company’s polymer-based pharmaceutical packaging products.\n•\nOur long-term debt obligations, net of unamortized debt issuance costs including fixed and variable-rate debt further discussed in Note 10,\n.\n•\nOur operating leases obligations primarily related to land, buildings, and machinery and equipment, with lease terms through 2047 further discussed in Note 6,\n.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions, some of which are subjective and complex, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position:\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets:\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, are tested for impairment whenever circumstances, such as a deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions or a change in company strategy, increased competition, declining product demand, plans to dispose of an asset or asset group, or recent financial or legal factors that could impact the expected cash flows, indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset. Impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, selection of appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. The Company uses estimates that are consistent with its business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated. Once an asset is considered impaired, an impairment loss is recorded within other expense (income) for the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value. For assets held and used in the business, management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset, discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate. For assets held for sale or for investment purposes, management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset, less disposition costs.\n41\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, following the completion of our annual budget and long-range planning process, or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, our operating segments. A goodwill impairment charge represents the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. Amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test, such as future sales, future cash flows and long-term growth rates, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. Amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products, as well as our timeliness and success in new-product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi-component systems. Changes in the estimate of fair value, including the estimate of future cash flows, could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. Accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance, to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We elected to follow this guidance for our annual impairment test. Based upon our assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.\nEmployee Benefits:\nWe maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements. In addition, we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled. Postretirement benefit plans are limited to only those active employees who met the eligibility requirements as of January 1, 2017. The measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to a number of assumptions, which are specific for each of our U.S. and foreign plans. The assumptions, which are reviewed at least annually, are relevant to both the plan assets (where applicable) and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. Two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension expense are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age, rates of compensation increases, mortality and turnover, and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. For our funded plans, we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets, as well as historical and expected rates of return, in estimating the long-term rate of return on plan assets. One of the most critical assumptions in determining retiree mental plan expense is the discount rate. Under U.S. GAAP, differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods.\nChanges in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. We estimate that every 25-basis point reduction in our long-term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by $0.7 million, and every 25-basis point reduction in our discount rate would decrease pension expense by $0.0 million. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations. Our net pension underfunded balance at December 31, 2021 was $20.6 million, compared to $40.8 million at December 31, 2020. Our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was $5.6 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $6.1 million at December 31, 2020.\n42\nIncome Taxes:\nWe estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation. In addition, deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of our assets and liabilities. The enacted statutory tax rate applied is based on the rate expected to be applicable at the time of the forecasted utilization of the loss carryforward or reversal of the temporary difference. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The realizability of deferred tax assets is subject to our estimates of future taxable income, generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level. Changes in tax legislation, business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments, which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined.\nWhen accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements, we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nPlease refer to Note 1,\nand Note 2,\n, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our significant accounting policies and accounting standards issued but not yet adopted.\n43"

    "text": "Our ongoing business operations expose us to various risks, such as fluctuating interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices. These risk factors can impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. To manage these market risks, we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, options and foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with, and for notional amounts equal to or less than, the related underlying exposures. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for investment or trading purposes. All derivatives are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nSales outside of the U.S. accounted for 57.7% of our consolidated net sales in 2021. Virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into USD for consolidated reporting purposes. Although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary, they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies. These items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses. As a result, our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates. We periodically use forward exchange contracts to hedge certain transactions or to manage month-end balance sheet exposures on cross-currency intercompany loans.\nWe have entered into forward exchange contracts, designated as fair value hedges, to manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates on cross-currency intercompany loans. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the total amount of these forward exchange contracts were $13.4 million and SGD 601.5 million.\nIn addition, we have entered into several foreign currency contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, for periods of up to eighteen months, intended to hedge the currency risk associated with a portion of our forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding foreign currency contracts to purchase and sell certain pairs of currencies, as follows:\nIn November and December 2019, in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding long-term borrowings under our Credit Facility denominated in Euro and Japanese Yen, we de-designated these borrowings as hedges of our net investments in certain European subsidiaries and Daikyo. The amounts recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these borrowings (prior to de-designation) will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss indefinitely, unless certain future events occur, such as the disposition of the operations for which the net investment hedges relate.\nIn December 2019, we entered into a five-year floating-to-floating forward-starting cross-currency swap (the “cross-currency swap”) for $90 million, which we designated as a hedge of our net investment in Daikyo. The notional amount of the cross-currency swap is ¥9.4 billion ($85.5 million) as of December 31, 2021. Under the cross-currency swap, we receive floating interest rate payments based on three-month USD LIBOR plus a margin, in return for paying floating interest rate payments based on three-month Japanese Yen LIBOR or successor rate plus a margin.\n44\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs a result of our normal borrowing activities, we have long-term debt with both fixed and variable interest rates. Long-term debt consists of our Term Loan and Series A, B and C notes.\nThe following table summarizes our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments:\nCommodity Price Risk\nMany of our proprietary products are made from synthetic elastomers, which are derived from the petroleum refining process. We purchase the majority of our elastomers via long-term supply contracts, some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In recent years, raw material costs have fluctuated due to crude oil price fluctuations. We expect this volatility to continue and will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies, and ongoing cost control initiatives, to offset the effects on gross profit.\nFrom November 2017 through December 2021, we purchased several series of call options for a total of 640,267 barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oil-based surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regards to a portion of our forecas\nted elastomer purchases.\nDuring 2021, the gain recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was $1.7 million. Dur\ning 2020, the loss recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was $0.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding contracts to purchase 188,242 barrels of crude oil from January 2022 to June 2023, at a weighted-average strike price of $74.16 per barrel.\n45"

We have no participation or other rights in variable interest entities.\nIn April 2019, we acquired the business of our distributor in South Korea for $\n18.9\nmillion. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded inventories, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and a customer relationships intangible asset of $\n4.5\nmillion, $\n0.6\nmillion, $\n2.6\nmillion and $\n11.2\nmillion, respectively. The goodwill was recorded within our Proprietary Products reportable segment. The results of this acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.\nWest has been actively monitoring the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) situation and its impact globally. Our production facilities continued to operate during the year as they had prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, other than for enhanced safety measures intended to prevent the spread of the virus and higher levels of production at certain plant locations to meet additional customer demand. The remote working arrangements and travel restrictions imposed by various governments had limited impact on our ability to maintain operations during the year, as our manufacturing operations have generally been exempted from stay-at-home orders.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies in the financial statements. Actual amounts realized may differ from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nCash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid short-term instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.\nAccounts Receivable:\nOur accounts receivable balance was net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n0.4\nmillion and $\n1.1\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Under the current expected credit loss model, we have adopted a provision matrix approach, utilizing historical loss rates based on the number of days past due, adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\nInventories:\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) and net realizable value.\nThe following is a summary of inventories at December 31:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n: Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost. Maintenance and minor repairs and renewals are charged to expense as incurred. Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application development activities and immediately expensed for preliminary project activities or post-implementation activities. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable assets, costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, and gains or losses are recognized in other expense (income). Depreciation and amortization are computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the remaining term of the lease, if shorter.\n51\nLeases:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Operating lease right-of-use assets are subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date.\nWe had\nno\nfinance leases as of December 31, 2021. Please refer to Note 6,\n, for additional information.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset. Once an asset is considered impaired, an impairment loss is recorded within other expense (income) for the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value. For assets held and used in the business, management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset, discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate. For assets held for sale or for investment purposes, management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset, less disposition costs.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, following the completion of our annual budget and long-range planning process, or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, our operating segments. A goodwill impairment charge represents the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance, to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We elected to follow this guidance for our annual impairment test. Based upon our assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of\n3\nto\n25\nyears, and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.\nEmployee Benefits:\nThe measurement of the obligations under our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans are subject to a number of assumptions. These include the rate of return on plan assets (for funded plans) and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to present value. For our funded plans, we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets, as well as historical and expected rates of return, in estimating the long-term rate of return on plan assets. U.S. GAAP requires the recognition of an asset or liability for the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, as measured by the difference between the fair value of plan assets, if any, and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement plan, such as a retiree health plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Please refer to Note 15,\n, for a more detailed discussion of our pension and other retirement plans.\n52\nFinancial Instruments\n: All derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and recorded at their fair value. For a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction (referred to as a cash flow hedge), the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”), net of tax, and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as a fair value hedge), the derivative’s gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. For a derivative designated as hedging the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss is reported in OCI, net of tax, as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portion of any derivative used in a hedging transaction is recognized immediately into earnings. Derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedges are also recorded at fair value, with the change in fair value recognized immediately into earnings. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instrument for investment or trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Translation\n: Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the determination of net income. Foreign currency translation adjustments of subsidiaries and affiliates operating outside of the U.S. are accumulated in other comprehensive loss, a separate component of equity.\nRevenue Recognition:\nOur revenue results from the sale of goods or services and reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We record revenue based on a five-step model, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606. Following the identification of a contract with a customer, we identify the performance obligations (goods or services) in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize the revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to our customers. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. We have elected to disregard the effects of a significant financing component, as we expect, at the inception of our contracts, that the period between when we transfer a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. In addition, we have elected to omit the disclosure of the majority of our remaining performance obligations, which are satisfied within one year or less.\nPlease refer to Note 3,\nfor additional information.\nShipping and Handling Costs\n: Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods and services sold. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers in connection with the sale are included in net sales.\nResearch and Development\n: Research and development expenditures are for the creation, engineering and application of new or improved products and processes. Expenditures include primarily salaries and outside services for those directly involved in research and development activities and are primarily expensed as incurred.\nEnvironmental Remediation and Compliance Costs\n: Environmental remediation costs are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonable estimates are determinable. Cost estimates include investigation, cleanup and monitoring activities; such estimates are adjusted, if necessary, based on additional findings. Environmental compliance costs are expensed as incurred as part of normal operations.\nLitigation\n: From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally incidental to our normal business activities. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are based on an analysis made by internal and external legal counsel considering information known at the time. Legal costs in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.\n53\nIncome Taxes:\nDeferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of our assets and liabilities. The enacted statutory tax rate applied is based on the rate expected to be applicable at the time of the forecasted utilization of the loss carryforward or reversal of the temporary difference. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The realizability of deferred tax assets is subject to our estimates of future taxable income, generally at the respective subsidiary company and the country level. Please refer to Note 17,\n, for additional information. We recognize interest costs related to income taxes in interest expense and penalties within other expense (income). The tax law ordering approach is used for purposes of determining whether an excess tax benefit has been realized during the year.\nStock-Based Compensation\n: Under the fair value provisions of U.S. GAAP, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date, we use the Black-Scholes valuation model.\nPlease refer to Note 14,\n, for a more detailed discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\nNet Income Per Share\n: Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Net income per share assuming dilution considers the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other stock awards based on the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes the use of exercise proceeds to repurchase common stock at the average fair market value in the period.\nNote 2:\nNew Accounting Standards\nStandards Issued Not Yet Adopted\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance which provides optional expedients and exceptions to address the impact of reference rate reform where contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or another reference rate need to be discontinued. This guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2022. We have identified the contracts impacted by reference rate reform, and have executed certain amendments to replace the use of LIBOR. We are currently working with counterparties to identify alternative reference rates to be used in any remaining contracts that have not yet been amended. The Company does not expect such adoption to cause a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued guidance that seeks to improve the transparency of financial disclosures for government assistance received by business entities. The amendment requires disclosures for transactions with a government accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entity’s financial statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and disclosures. The Company does not expect such adoption to cause a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.\n54\nNote 3:\nRevenue\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize the majority of our revenue, primarily relating to Proprietary Products product sales, at a point in time, following the transfer of control of our products to our customers, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the related agreements.\nWe recognize revenue relating to our Contract-Manufactured Products product sales and certain Proprietary Products product sales over time, as our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\nWe recognize revenue relating to our development and tooling agreements over time, as our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced.\nFor revenue recognized over time, revenue is recognized by applying a method of measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the related performance obligation. When selecting the method for measuring progress, we select the method that best depicts the transfer of control of goods or services promised to our customers.\nRevenue for our Contract-Manufactured Products product sales, certain Proprietary Products product sales, and our development and tooling agreements is recorded under an input method, which recognizes revenue on the basis of our efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation (for example, resources consumed, labor hours expended, costs incurred, time elapsed, or machine hours used) relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation. The input method that we use is based on costs incurred.\nThe majority of the performance obligations within our contracts are satisfied within one year or less. Performance obligations satisfied beyond one year include those relating to a nonrefundable customer payment of $\n20.0\nmillion received in June 2013 in return for the exclusive use of the SmartDose technology platform within a specific therapeutic area. As of December 31, 2021, there was $\n3.9\nmillion of unearned income related to this payment, of which $\n0.9\nmillion was included in other current liabilities and $\n3.0\nmillion was included in other long-term liabilities. The unearned income is being recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the agreement. The agreement does not include a future minimum purchase commitment from the customer.\nOur revenue can be generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations. When a sales agreement involves multiple performance obligations, each obligation is separately identified and the transaction price is allocated based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer.\nSome customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes. We record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained. We also maintain an allowance for product returns, as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience and specific identification of customer claims.\n55\nThe following table presents the approximate percentage of our net sales by market group:\nThe following table presents the approximate percentage of our net sales by product category:\nThe following table presents the approximate percentage of our net sales by geographic location:\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets and liabilities result from transactions with revenue primarily recorded over time. If the measure of remaining rights exceeds the measure of the remaining performance obligations, we record a contract asset. Contract assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts receivable, net, and other assets (current and noncurrent portions, respectively). Contract assets included in accounts receivable, net, relate to the unbilled amounts of our product sales for which we have recognized revenue over time. Contract assets included in other assets represent the remaining performance obligations of our development and tooling agreements. Conversely, if the measure of the remaining performance obligations exceeds the measure of the remaining rights, we record a contract liability. Contract liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet within other liabilities (current and noncurrent portions, respectively) and represent cash payments received in advance of our performance.\n56\nThe following table summarizes our contract assets and liabilities, excluding amounts included in accounts receivable, net:\nThe increase in deferred income during 2021 was primarily due to additional cash payments of $\n112.3\nmillion received in advance of satisfying future performance obligations, partially offset by the recognition of current year revenue of $\n72.0\nmillion, and $\n31.8\nmillion of revenue that was included in deferred income at the beginning of the year.\nVoluntary Recall\nOn January 24, 2019, we issued a voluntary recall of our Vial2Bag\n®\nproduct line due to reports of potential unpredictable or variable dosing under certain conditions. Our fourth quarter 2018 results included an $\n11.3\nmillion provision for product returns, recorded as a reduction of sales, partially offset by a reduction in cost of goods sold reflecting our inventory balance for these devices at December 31, 2018. During 2019, we recorded a net provision of $\n5.4\nmillion for inventory returns from our customers and related in-house inventory, partially offset by a reduction in our pro\nvision for product returns. On October 21, 2020 we received market clearance from the FDA for our Vial2BagAdvanced\nTM\n2\n0mm Admixture Device.\nNote 4:\nNet Income Per Share\nThe following table reconciles the shares used in the calculation of basic net income per share to those used for diluted net income per share:\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were\n0.0 million\n,\n0.0 million\n, and\n0.1\nmillion shares, respectively, from stock-based compensation plans not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their impact was antidilutive.\nIn December 2020, we announced a share repurchase program for calendar-year 2021 authorizing the repurchase of up to\n631,000\nshares of our common stock from time to time on the open market as permitted under Exchange Act Rule 10b-18 or in privately-negotiated transactions. There were\nno\nshares purchased during the three months ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased\n479,000\nshares of our common stock under the now completed program at a cost of $\n137.1\nmillion, or an average price of $\n286.23\nper share.\n57\nIn December 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for calendar-year 2022 authorizing the repurchase of up to\n650,000\nshares of our common stock from time to time on the open market as permitted under Exchange Act Rule 10b-18 or in privately-negotiated transactions. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such transactions will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions. This share repurchase program is expected to be completed by December 31, 2022.\nNote 5:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nA summary of gross property, plant and equipment at December 31 is presented in the following table:\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n116.9\nmillion, $\n104.7\nmillion and $\n100.0\nmillion, respectively.\nWe capitalize interest on borrowings during the active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n2.0\nmillion, $\n1.4\nmillion and $\n0.9\nmillion, respectively.\nNote 6:\nLeases\nAdoption of ASC 842\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASC 842, using the modified retrospective approach that allows companies to apply ASC 842 as of the effective date and on a prospective basis. As a result, we were not required to adjust our comparative period financial information for effects of ASC 842 or present the new required lease disclosures for periods prior to the date of adoption. As of December 31, 2021, we had operating leases primarily related to land, buildings, and machinery and equipment, with lease terms through 2047. Certain of our operating leases provide us with an option, exercisable at our sole discretion, to terminate the lease or extend the lease term for\none year\nor more. At this time, the Company is not able to assert whether any of these options will be exercised. We had\nno\nfinance leases as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe operating lease right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. The operating lease right-of-use assets are subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The operating lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date.\n58\nJudgments used in applying ASC 842 include determining: i) whether a contract is, or contains, a lease; ii) the discount rate to be used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value; iii) the lease term; and iv) the lease payments. We determine if a contract is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. A lease exists when a contract conveys to the customer the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The definition of a lease embodies two conditions: 1) there is an identified asset in the contract that is land or a depreciable asset (i.e., property, plant, and equipment); and 2) the customer has the right to control the use of the identified asset. ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As all of our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. The lease term for all of our operating leases includes the noncancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a lessee option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor. Lease payments included in the measurement of the operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are comprised of fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), variable payments that depend on an index or rate, and the exercise price of a lessee option to purchase the underlying asset if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nSupplemental information related to leases was as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was\n10.7\nyears and\n11.1\nyears and the weighted average discount rate was\n3.58\n% and\n3.68\n%, respectively.\n59\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nWe have elected to adopt practical expedients around the combination of lease and non-lease components and the portfolio approach relating to discount rates. These practical expedients were applied consistently to all leases.\nWe have elected not to recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities for all short-term leases (leases with an initial lease term of\n12\nmonths or less). We recognize the lease payments associated with our short-term leases as an expense over the lease term.\nNote 7:\nAffiliated Companies\nAt December 31, 2021, the following affiliated companies were accounted for under the equity method:\nOn November 1, 2019, in connection with the amendment of certain commercial agreements with Daikyo, we increased our ownership interest from\n25\n% to\n49\n% in Daikyo in exchange for $\n85.1\nmillion in cash and $\n4.9\nmillion in shares of our treasury stock to certain stockholders of Daikyo.\nUnremitted income of affiliated companies included in consolidated retained earnings amounted to $\n115.6\nmillion, $\n98.2\nmillion and $\n82.4\nmillion at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Dividends received from affiliated companies were $\n2.7\nmillion in 2021, $\n1.6\nmillion in 2020 and $\n2.2\nmillion in 2019.\nOur equity in net unrealized gains of Daikyo’s investment securities and derivative instruments, as well as pension adjustments, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was $\n1.5\nmillion, $\n0.6\nmillion and $\n0.4\nmillion at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n60\nOur purchases from, and royalty payments made to, affiliates totaled $\n155.0\nmillion, $\n143.3\nmillion and $\n115.1\nmillion, respectively, in 2021, 2020 and 2019, of which $\n25.5\nmillion and $\n33.6\nmillion was due and payable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The majority of these transactions related to a distributorship agreement with Daikyo that allows us to purchase and re-sell Daikyo products. Sales to affiliates were $\n12.0\nmillion, $\n9.7\nmillion and $\n9.2\nmillion, respectively, in 2021, 2020 and 2019, of which $\n2.3\nmillion and $\n1.4\nmillion was receivable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in affiliated companies that are accounted for under the equity method was $\n201.2\nmillion and $\n201.9\nmillion, respectively, and the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in affiliated companies that are not accounted for under the equity method was $\n6.5\nmillion and $\n12.8\nmillion, respectively. We have elected to record these investments, for which fair value was not readily determinable, at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes. We test these investments for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments may not be recoverable.\nNote 8:\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $\n0.1\nmillion in accumulated goodwill impairment losses.\nIntangible assets and accumulated amortization as of December 31 were as follows:\nThe cost basis of intangible assets includes a foreign currency translation loss of $\n1.3\nmillion and a foreign currency translation gain of $\n1.3\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n5.4\nmillion, $\n4.4\nmillion and $\n3.4\nmillion, respectively. Estimated annual amortization expense for the next five years is as follows: 2022 - $\n4.0\nmillion, 2023 - $\n4.0\nmillion, 2024 - $\n4.0\nmillion, 2025 - $\n3.0\nmillion and 2026 - $\n2.8\nmillion.\n61\nNote 9:\nOther Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities as of December 31 included the following:\nNote 10:\nDebt\nThe following table summarizes our long-term debt obligations, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and current maturities, at December 31. The interest rates shown in parentheses are as of December 31, 2021.\n62\nCredit Agreement - Credit Facility\nIn March 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement which expires in March 2024, and contains the Credit Facility of $\n300.0\nmillion, with sublimits of up to $\n30.0\nmillion for swing line loans for domestic borrowers in USD and a $\n20.0\nmillion swing line loan for our German Holding Company and up to $\n30.0\nmillion for the issuance of standby letters of credit. The Credit Facility may be increased from time-to-time by the greater of $\n350.0\nmillion and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for the preceding\ntwelve month\nperiod in the aggregate through an increase in the Credit Facility, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at either the base rate (the per annum interest rate of the highest of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus\n50\nbasis points or the daily LIBOR, plus\n1.00\n%) or at the applicable LIBOR rate, plus a tiered margin based on the ratio of our net consolidated debt to our modified EBITDA, ranging from\n0\nto\n37.5\nbasis points for base rate loans and\n87.5\nto\n137.5\nbasis points for LIBOR rate loans. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants providing that we shall not permit the ratio of our net consolidated debt to our modified EBITDA to be greater than\n3.5\nto 1; provided that, no more than\nthree\ntimes during the term of the Credit Agreement, upon the occurrence of a qualified acquisition for each of our\nfour\nfiscal quarters immediately following such qualified acquisition, the ratio shall be increased to\n4.0\nto 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary limitations on liens securing our indebtedness, fundamental changes (mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions), asset sales, distributions and acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, total unamortized debt issuance costs of $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n0.4\nmillion, respectively, were recorded in other noncurrent assets and are being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the Credit Facility.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2021, the borrowing capacity available under the Credit Facility, including outstanding letters of credit of $\n2.4\nmillion, was $\n297.6\nmillion.\nCredit Agreement Amendment - Term Loan\nIn December 2019, we entered into a First Amendment and Incremental Facility Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment and the Credit Agreement, we established the Term Loan in the amount of $\n90.0\nmillion, which is due on December 31, 2024. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus\n87.5\nbasis points. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were unamortized debt issuance costs remaining of $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n0.1\nmillion, respectively, which are being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the Term Loan.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $\n85.5\nmillion in borrowings under the Term Loan, of which $\n2.2\nmillion was classified as current and $\n83.3\nmillion was classified as long-term. Please refer to Note 11,\n, for a discussion of the foreign currency hedge associated with the Term Loan.\nPrivate Placement\nIn 2012, we concluded a private placement issuance of $\n168.0\nmillion in senior unsecured notes. The total amount of the private placement issuance was divided into\nthree\ntranches - $\n42.0\nmillion\n3.67\n% Series A Notes due July 5, 2022, $\n53.0\nmillion\n3.82\n% Series B Notes due July 5, 2024, and $\n73.0\nmillion\n4.02\n% Series C Notes due July 5, 2027 (the “Notes”). The Notes rank pari passu with our other senior unsecured debt. The weighted average of the coupon interest rates on the Notes is\n3.87\n%. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were unamortized debt issuance costs remaining of $\n0.3\nmillion and $\n0.4\nmillion, respectively, which are being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the Notes.\n63\nCovenants\nPursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.\nInterest costs incurred during 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n10.2\nmillion, $\n9.6\nmillion and $\n9.4\nmillion, respectively. The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, are as follows: $\n44.2\nmillion in 2022, 2023 - $\n2.3\nmillion, 2024 - $\n134.0\nmillion, 2025 - $\n0.0 million\n, 2026 - $\n0.0 million\n, and thereafter - $\n73.0\nmillion.\nNote 11:\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nOur ongoing business operations expose us to various risks, such as fluctuating interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices. To manage these market risks, we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, options and foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with, and for notional amounts equal to or less than, the related underlying exposures. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for investment or trading purposes. All derivatives are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe have entered into forward exchange contracts, designated as fair value hedges, to manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates on cross-currency intercompany loans. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the total amount of these forward exchange contracts was SGD\n601.5\nmillion and $\n13.4\nmillion.\nIn addition, we have entered into several foreign currency contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, for periods of up to\neighteen months\n, intended to hedge the currency risk associated with a portion of our forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding foreign currency contracts to purchase and sell certain pairs of currencies, as follows:\nIn November and December 2019, in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding long-term borrowings under our Credit Facility denominated in Euro and Japanese Yen, we de-designated these borrowings as hedges of our net investments in certain European subsidiaries and Daikyo. The amounts recorded as cumulative translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these borrowings (prior to de-designation) will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss indefinitely, unless certain future events occur, such as the disposition of the operations for which the net investment hedges relate.\nIn December 2019, we entered into a\nfive-year\nfloating-to-floating forward-starting cross-currency swap (the “cross-currency swap”) for $\n90\nmillion, which we designated as a hedge of our net investment in Daikyo. The notional amount of the cross-currency swap is ¥\n9.4\nbillion ($\n85.5\nmillion) as of December 31, 2021. Under the cross-currency swap, we receive floating interest rate payments based on three-month USD LIBOR plus a margin, in return for paying floating interest rate payments based on three-month Japanese Yen LIBOR or successor rate plus a margin.\n64\nCommodity Price Risk\nMany of our proprietary products are made from synthetic elastomers, which are derived from the petroleum refining process. We purchase the majority of our elastomers via long-term supply contracts, some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices. The following economic hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment since they did not meet the highly effective requirement at inception.\nFrom November 2017 through December 2021, we purchased several series of call options for a total of\n640,267\nbarrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oil-based surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regards to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding contracts to purchase\n188,242\nbarrels of crude oil from January 2022 to June 2023, at a weighted-average strike price of $\n74.16\nper barrel.\nEffects of Derivative Instruments on Financial Position and Results of Operations\nPlease refer to Note 12,\n, for the balance sheet location and fair values of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the effects of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31:\nWe recognize in earnings the initial value of forward point components on a straight-line basis over the life of the fair value hedge. The amounts recognized in earnings, pre-tax, for forward point components for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n2.6\nmillion, $\n6.3\nmillion and $\n8.7\nmillion, respectively. We expect to recognize $\n2.6\nmillion in earnings, pre-tax, for forward point components in 2022.\n65\nThe following tables summarize the effects of derivative instruments designated as fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges on OCI and earnings, net of tax, for the years ended December 31:\n66\nThe following table summarizes the effects of derivative instruments designated as fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges by line item in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31:\nThe following table summarizes the effects of derivative instruments not designated as hedges in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31:\nDuring 2021 and 2020, there was no material ineffectiveness related to our hedges.\n67\nNote 12:\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy classifies the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into one of three levels:\n•\nLevel 1\n: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2\n: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\n•\nLevel 3\n: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions.\nThe following tables present the assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis:\n68\nDeferred compensation assets are included within other noncurrent assets and are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices in an active market. The fair value of our foreign currency contracts, included within other current and other noncurrent assets, as well as other current and other long-term liabilities, is valued using an income approach based on quoted forward foreign exchange rates and spot rates at the reporting date. The fair value of our commodity call options, included within other current and other noncurrent assets, is valued using a market approach. The fair value of our contingent consideration, included within other current and other long-term liabilities, is discussed further in the section related to Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair value of deferred compensation liabilities is based on quoted prices of the underlying employees’ investment selections and is included within other long-term liabilities. The fair value of the cross-currency swap, included within other long-term assets and other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, is valued using a market approach. Please refer to Note 11,\n, for further discussion of our derivatives.\nLevel 3 Fair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the SmartDose technology platform (the “SmartDose contingent consideration”) was initially determined using a probability-weighted income approach, and is revalued at each reporting date or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Changes in the fair value of this obligation are recorded as income or expense within other expense (income) in our consolidated statements of income. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the SmartDose contingent consideration are the sales projections, the probability of success factors, and the discount rate. Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. Sales projections were derived using upside, base and downside forecasted cases for each partnership and applying probability-weighted scenarios of\n10\n%,\n50\n% and\n40\n% to the three cases, respectively, to reflect the likelihood of West meeting the estimated sales projection targets. The probability of success factors included the probabilities of successful FDA approval for each partnership drug, which was estimated in a range of\n19\n% to\n100\n% based on the development phase of each respective drug, and the probability of the successful execution of supply agreements with each partnership, which was estimated in the range of\n25\n% to\n100\n% based on historical, current, and future supply agreements with the respective partnerships. The fair value of this liability utilized a risk-adjusted discount rate of\n19\n% to present value the cash flows. The discount rate is calculated by determining the after-tax required returns on debt and equity and weighting each return by the respective percent of debt and equity to total capital. Key inputs for the discount rate include the risk-free rate on the 20-Year United States Treasury maturity, equity risk premium, company-specific risk premium, pre-tax cost of debt, and U.S. tax rate, among others. As development and commercialization of the SmartDose technology platform progresses, we may need to update the sales projections, the probability of success factors, and the discount rate used. This could result in a material increase or decrease to the SmartDose contingent consideration.\n69\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our Level 3 fair value measurements:\nOther Financial Instruments\nWe believe that the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable approximate their fair values due to their near-term maturities.\nThe estimated fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities, and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of long-term debt was $\n217.9\nmillion compared to a carrying amount of $\n208.8\nmillion. At December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of long-term debt was $\n265.7\nmillion and the carrying amount was $\n252.9\nmillion.\n70\nNote 13:\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax:\nA summary of the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss is presented in the following table ($ in millions):\n(a) These components are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost. Please refer to Note 15,\n, for additional details.\n71\nNote 14:\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2016 Plan”) provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and performance awards to employees and non-employee directors. A committee of the Board of Directors determines the terms and conditions of awards to be granted. Vesting requirements vary by award. At December 31, 2021, there were\n2,052,885\nshares remaining in the 2016 Plan for future grants.\nStock options and stock appreciation rights reduce the number of shares available by\none\nshare for each award granted. All other awards under the 2016 Plan will reduce the total number of shares available for grant by an amount equal to\n2.5\ntimes the number of shares awarded. If awards made under previous plans would entitle a plan participant to an amount of West stock in excess of the target amount, the additional shares (up to a maximum threshold amount) will be distributed under the 2016 Plan.\nThe following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31:\nThe Company estimates expected forfeitures. The amount of unrecognized compensation expense for all non-vested awards as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $\n37.3\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.5\nyears.\nStock Options\nStock options granted to employees vest in equal increments. All awards expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant. Upon the exercise of stock options, shares are issued in exchange for the exercise price of the options.\nThe following table summarizes changes in outstanding options:\n72\nAs of December 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding and of options exercisable was\n5.5\nyears and\n4.5\nyears, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the aggregate intrinsic value of total options outstanding was $\n751.0\nmillion, of which $\n573.7\nmillion represented vested options.\nThe fair value of the options was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that used the following weighted average assumptions in 2021, 2020 and 2019: a risk-free interest rate of\n0.8\n%,\n1.3\n%, and\n2.3\n%, respectively; stock volatility of\n23.9\n%,\n22.4\n%, and\n22.5\n%, respectively; and dividend yields of\n0.3\n%,\n0.4\n%, and\n0.7\n%, respectively. Stock volatility is estimated based on historical data and the impact from expected future trends. Expected lives, which are based on prior experience, averaged\n5.6\nyears for 2021 and\n5.7\nyears for 2020 and 2019. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n64.51\n, $\n40.28\nand $\n24.72\n, respectively. Stock option expense is recognized over the vesting period, net of forfeitures.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the intrinsic value of options exercised was $\n147.3\nmillion, $\n88.8\nmillion and $\n46.9\nmillion, respectively. The grant date fair value of options vested during those same periods was $\n8.3\nmillion, $\n8.4\nmillion and $\n7.5\nmillion, respectively.\nStock Appreciation Rights\nStock appreciation rights (“SARs”) granted to eligible international employees vest in equal annual increments over\n4\nyears of continuous service. All awards expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant. The fair value of each cash-settled SAR is adjusted at the end of each reporting period, with the resulting change reflected in expense. As of December 31, 2021, SARs outstanding were\n21,054\n, all of which were cash-settled. Upon exercise of a cash-settled SAR, the employee receives cash for the difference between the grant date price and the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of exercise. As a result of the cash settlement feature, cash-settled SARs are recorded within other long-term liabilities. Upon exercise of a stock-settled SAR, shares are issued in exchange for the exercise price of the stock-settled SAR. As a result of the stock settlement feature, stock-settled SARs are recorded within equity.\nThe following table summarizes changes in outstanding SARs:\n73\nPerformance Awards\nIn addition to stock options and SAR awards, we grant performance share unit (“PSU”) awards to eligible employees. These awards are earned based on the Company’s performance against pre-established targets, including annual growth rate of revenue and return on invested capital, over a specified performance period. Depending on the achievement of the targets, recipients of stock-settled PSU awards are entitled to receive a certain number of shares of common stock, whereas recipients of cash-settled PSU awards are entitled to receive a payment in cash per unit based on the fair market value of a share of our common stock at the end of the performance period.\nThe following table summarizes changes in our outstanding stock-settled PSU awards:\nShares earned under PSU awards may vary from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of an employee’s targeted award. The fair value of stock-settled PSU awards is based on the market price of our stock at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the performance period, adjusted for estimated target outcomes and net of forfeitures. The weighted average grant date fair value of stock-settled PSU awards granted during the years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n333.58\n, $\n177.31\nand $\n103.40\n, respectively. Including forfeiture and target achievement expectations, we expect that the stock-settled PSU awards will convert to\n144,488\nshares to be issued over an average remaining term of\none year\n.\nThe fair value of cash-settled PSU awards is also based on the market price of our stock at the grant date. These awards are revalued at the end of each quarter based on changes in our stock price. As a result of the cash settlement feature, cash-settled PSU awards are recorded within other long-term liabilities.\n74\nThe following table summarizes changes in our outstanding cash-settled PSU awards:\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe also offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which provides for the sale of our common stock to eligible employees at\n85\n% of the current market price on the last trading day of each quarterly offering period. Payroll deductions are limited to\n25\n% of the employee’s base salary, not to exceed $\n25,000\nin any one calendar year. In addition, employees may not buy more than\n2,000\nshares during any offering period (\n8,000\nshares per year). Purchases under the ESPP were\n27,016\nshares,\n36,494\nshares and\n51,391\nshares for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately\n3,766,202\nshares available for issuance under the ESPP.\nDeferred Compensation Plans and Restricted Share Awards\nOur deferred compensation plans include a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, under which non-employee directors may defer all or part of their annual cash retainers. The deferred fees may be credited to a stock-equivalent account. Amounts credited to this account are converted into deferred stock units based on the fair market value of\none\nshare of our common stock on the last day of the quarter. For deferred stock units ultimately paid in cash, a liability is calculated at an amount determined by multiplying the number of units by the fair market value of our common stock at the end of each reporting period. In addition, deferred stock awards are granted on the date of our annual meeting, and are distributed in shares of common stock. In 2021, we granted\n6,034\ndeferred stock awards, with a weighted grant date fair value of $\n338.38\n. In 2020, we granted\n10,302\ndeferred stock awards, with a grant date fair value of $\n194.29\n. Similarly, a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for eligible employees provides for the conversion of compensation into deferred stock units. As of December 31, 2021, the\ntwo\ndeferred compensation plans held a total of\n406,361\ndeferred stock units, including\n8,390\nunits to be paid in cash.\nIn addition, during 2021, we granted\n6,002\nrestricted share awards at a weighted grant-date fair value of $\n312.41\nper share to employees under the 2016 Plan. During 2020, we granted\n8,721\nrestricted share awards at a weighted grant-date fair value of $\n200.35\nper share to employees under the 2016 Plan. During 2019, we granted\n13,308\nrestricted share awards at a weighted grant-date fair value of $\n116.39\nper share to employees under the 2016 Plan. The fair value of these awards is based on the market price of our stock at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the vesting period.\n75\nNote 15:\nBenefit Plans\nCertain of our U.S. and international subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. In addition, we provide minimal death benefits for certain U.S. retirees and pay a portion of healthcare costs for retired U.S. salaried employees and their dependents. Benefits for participants are coordinated with Medicare when possible. We also sponsor a defined contribution plan for certain salaried and hourly U.S. employees. Our 401(k) plan contributions were $\n19.5\nmillion for 2021, $\n16.8\nmillion for 2020 and $\n15.6\nmillion for 2019.\nPension and Other Retirement Benefits\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in OCI were as follows:\nNet periodic benefit cost by geographic location is as follows:\nThe service cost component included within net periodic benefit cost is considered employee compensation and is therefore presented within the selling, general, and administrative and costs of goods and services sold financial statement line items of our consolidated statements of income. The remaining components of net periodic benefit cost are reported separately and are therefore presented within the other nonoperating (income) expense financial statement line item of our consolidated statements of income.\n76\nDuring 2021, 2020, and 2019 we recorded $\n1.8\nmillion, $\n3.7\nmillion, and $\n3.5\nmillion in pension settlement charges within other nonoperating (income) expense, respectively, as we determined that normal-course lump-sum payments for our U.S. qualified, and in 2020 and 2019 our non-qualified, defined benefit pension plans exceeded the threshold for settlement accounting under U.S. GAAP for the year. Effective January 1, 2019, except for interest crediting, benefit accruals under these defined benefit pension plans ceased.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we did\nno\nt contribute to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nThe following table presents the changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, as well as the funded status of the plans:\nInternational pension plan assets, at fair value, included in the preceding table were $\n49.3\nmillion and $\n43.9\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n77\nAmounts recognized in the balance sheet were as follows:\nThe amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss, pre-tax, consisted of:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n265.2\nmillion and $\n293.9\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, including $\n73.0\nmillion and $\n83.1\nmillion, respectively, for international pension plans.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our U.S. and United Kingdom qualified defined benefit pension plan had plan assets in excess of its obligations. As of December 31, 2020, only the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan had assets in excess of its obligations. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our other defined benefit pension plans had projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.\nBenefit payments expected to be paid under our defined benefit pension and other retirement benefit plans in the next ten years are as follows. The U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan is in the process of being terminated. The expected benefit payments listed correspond to regular ongoing benefit payments expected to be made by the plan during future years, and does not reflect additional disbursements that are expected to be made during 2022 as a result of lump sum offering and annuity purchase related to the plan termination process.\nIn 2022, we expect to contribute $\n0.8\nmillion to pension plans, all of which is in the U.S. In addition, we expect to contribute $\n0.7\nmillion for other retirement benefits in 2022. We periodically consider additional, voluntary contributions depending on the investment returns generated by pension plan assets, changes in benefit obligation projections and other factors. For the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, a contribution might be needed in order to settle the plan's obligations during the plan termination process.\n78\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows:\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations were as follows:\nThe discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations for U.S. pension plans was\n2.95\n% and\n2.60\n% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations for all international plans was\n1.32\n% and\n0.89\n% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average rate of compensation increase for all international plans was\n2.79\n% for 2021 and\n2.58\n% for 2020, while there was no rate increase for the U.S. plans since they are frozen. Other retirement benefits were only available to U.S. employees. The expected long-term rate of return for U.S. plans, which accounts for\n80.2\n% of global plan assets, was\n5.10\n% for 2021,\n5.10\n% for 2020 and\n5.60\n% for 2019.\nThe assumed healthcare cost trend rate used to determine benefit obligations was\n6.25\n% for all participants in 2021, decreasing to\n5.0\n% by 2027. The assumed healthcare cost trend rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost was\n6.5\n% for all participants in 2021, decreasing to\n5.0\n% by 2027.\nThe defined pension plan benefit and other retirement plan benefit obligations decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the obligation. The net actuarial losses will be impacted in future periods by actual asset returns, discount rate changes, currency exchange rate fluctuations, actual demographic experience, and certain other factors. The other retirement plan benefit obligation decreased slightly due to the activity mentioned above.\nThe Company has cash balance plans and other plans with promised interest crediting rates. For these plans, the interest crediting rates are set in line with plan rules or country legislation and do not change with market conditions.\nThe weighted average interest crediting rating used to determine net periodic benefit cost by geographic location for our pension plans, at December 31, were as follows:\nThe weighted average asset allocations by asset category for our pension plans, at December 31, were as follows:\n79\nOur U.S. pension plan is managed as a balanced portfolio comprised of two components: equity and fixed income debt securities. Equity investments are used to maximize the long-term real growth of fund assets, while fixed income investments are used to generate current income, provide for a more stable periodic return and provide some protection against a prolonged decline in the market value of equity investments. Temporary funds may be held as cash. We maintain a long-term strategic asset allocation policy which provides guidelines for ensuring that the fund’s investments are managed with the short-term and long-term financial goals of the fund, while allowing the flexibility to react to unexpected changes in capital markets.\nDiversification across and within asset classes is the primary means by which we mitigate risk. We maintain guidelines for all asset and sub-asset categories in order to avoid excessive investment concentrations. Fund assets are monitored on a regular basis. If at any time the fund asset allocation is not within the acceptable allocation range, funds will be reallocated. We also review the fund on a regular basis to ensure that the investment returns received are consistent with the short-term and long-term goals of the fund and with comparable market returns. We are prohibited from pledging fund securities and from investing pension fund assets in our own stock, securities on margin or derivative securities.\nThe following are the U.S. target asset allocations and acceptable allocation ranges:\nThe following tables present the fair value of our pension plan assets, utilizing the fair value hierarchy discussed in Note 12,\n. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, certain pension plan assets measured at net asset value (“NAV”) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n80\nNote 16:\nOther Expense (Income)\nOther expense (income) consisted of:\nRestructuring and Related Charges\nIn July 2020, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan designed to optimize certain organizational structures within the Company to better support our continued growth and business priorities. These changes are expected to be implemented over a period of up to\ntwenty-four months\nfrom the date of the approval. The plan was originally expected to require restructuring and related charges of approximately $\n15\nmillion to $\n17\nmillion, with annualized savings being in the range of $\n3.5\nmillion to $\n4.5\nmillion. Due to the recent increase in customer demand, the Company will no longer proceed with certain portions of the plan, thus reducing the total expected charges to be approximately $\n7\nmillion to $\n8\nmillion. Similarly, annualized savings are now expected to be in the range of $\n0.9\nmillion to $\n1.6\nmillion. Since its approval, we recorded a net pre-tax amount equal to $\n6.8\nmillion in restructuring related charges associated with this plan.\n81\nThe following table presents activity related to our restructuring obligations related to our 2020 restructuring plan:\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan designed to realign our manufacturing capacity with demand. These changes were expected to be implemented over a period of up to\ntwenty-four months\nfrom the date of the approval. The plan was expected to require restructuring and related charges of approximately $\n16.0\nmillion. Since its approval, we recorded $\n13.7\nmillion in restructuring and related charges associated with this plan. The plan is now considered complete.\nDuring 2019, we recorded $\n4.9\nmillion in restructuring and related charges associated with this plan, consisting of $\n2.6\nmillion for severance charges, $\n0.3\nmillion for non-cash asset write-downs associated with the discontinued use of certain equipment, and $\n2.0\nmillion for other non-cash charges.\nThe following table presents activity related to our restructuring obligations related to our 2018 restructuring plan:\nOn February 15, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan designed to repurpose several of our production facilities in support of growing high-value proprietary products and to realign operational and commercial activities to meet the needs of our new market-focused commercial organization. During 2019, we recorded $\n0.3\nmillion in additional charges related to this restructuring plan. Our remaining restructuring obligations related to our 2016 restructuring plan are complete.\nOther\nDuring 2021, specific to our cost method investments, we recorded a total impairment charge of $\n4.6\nmillion which was offset by a net gain of $\n0.3\nmillion on the sale of a cost investment. During 2020, specific to our cost method investments, we recorded a total impairment charge of $\n2.5\nmillion.\nDuring 2019, we recorded a charge of $\n1.0\nmillion as a result of the continued devaluation of Argentina’s currency.\nDuring 2019, we recognized a tax recovery of $\n4.7\nmillion related to previously-paid international excise taxes, following a favorable court ruling.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded development income of $\n0.9\nmillion in each year, related to a nonrefundable customer payment of $\n20.0\nmillion received in June 2013 in return for the exclusive use of the SmartDose technology platform within a specific therapeutic area. Please refer to Note 3,\n, for additional information.\n82\nContingent consideration represents changes in the fair value of the SmartDose contingent consideration. Please refer to Note 12,\n, for additional details.\nNote 17:\nIncome Taxes\nAs a global organization, we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2021, the statute of limitations for the U.S. federal tax years 2017 through 2021 remain open to examination. For U.S. state and local jurisdictions, tax years 2013 through 2021 are open to examination. We are also subject to examination in various foreign jurisdictions for tax years 2014 through 2021.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nIn addition, we had balances in accrued liabilities for interest and penalties of $\n0.5\nmillion and $\n0.3\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had $\n24.9\nmillion of total gross unrecognized tax benefits, which, if recognized, $\n16.7\nmillion would favorably impact the effective income tax rate. It is reasonably possible that, due to the expiration of statutes and the closing of tax audits, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by approximately $\n0.4\nmillion during the next twelve months, which would favorably impact our effective tax rate.\nThe components of income before income taxes are:\nThe related provision for income taxes consists of:\nDeferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.\n83\nThe significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 are\n:\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to our effective consolidated tax rate on income before income taxes is as follows:\nDuring 2021, we recorded a tax benefit of $\n1.4\nmillion due to the impact of tax law changes enacted during the year, a tax benefit of $\n18.5\nmillion due to the Company's prepayment of future royalties from one of its subsidiaries, and a tax benefit of $\n31.5\nmillion associated with stock-based compensation.\nDuring 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $\n0.5\nmillion due to the impact of tax law changes enacted during the year and a tax benefit of $\n20.8\nmillion associated with stock-based compensation.\nDuring 2019, we recorded a net tax benefit of $\n0.3\nmillion for the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Act and a tax benefit of $\n10.3\nmillion associated with stock-based compensation.\n84\nState operating loss carryforwards of $\n138.6\nmillion created a deferred tax asset of $\n10.6\nmillion, while foreign operating loss carryforwards of $\n20.0\nmillion created a deferred tax asset of $\n3.4\nmillion. Management estimates that certain state and foreign operating loss carryforwards are unlikely to be utilized and the associated deferred tax assets have been fully reserved. In 2021, it was determined that $\n4.4\nmillion of previously reserved state loss carryforwards were more likely than not to be utilized prior to expiration. State loss carryforwards expire as follows: $\n7.8\nmillion in 2022 and $\n130.8\nmillion thereafter. Foreign loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2030, while $\n18.0\nmillion of the total $\n20.0\nmillion will not expire.\nDuring 2019, we utilized all of our remaining U.S. federal research and development credit carryforwards. State research and development credit carryforwards of $\n1.0\nmillion created a deferred tax asset of $\n0.8\nmillion. As of December 31, 2021, $\n0.4\nmillion of state research and development credits expire in 2025.\nIn response to the 2017 Tax Act, we reevaluated our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through 2017 (with the exception of China and Mexico) and decided that those profits were no longer permanently reinvested. As of January 1, 2018, we reasserted indefinite reinvestment related to all post-2017 unremitted earnings in all of our foreign subsidiaries. In general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is de minimis, and that position has not changed subsequent to the one-time transition tax under the 2017 Tax Act, except as noted above. Accordingly, no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of approximately $\n635.3\nmillion of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S., as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested. Further, it is impracticable for us to estimate any future tax costs for any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities associated with our indefinite reinvestment assertion, because the actual tax liability, if any, would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws, exchange rates, circumstances existing when there is a repatriation, sale or liquidation, or other factors.\nNote 18:\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAt December 31, 2021, we were obligated under various operating lease agreements. Please refer to Note 6,\n, for additional details.\nAt December 31, 2021, we were obligated under various defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements. Please refer to Note 15,\n, for additional details.\nAt December 31, 2021, our outstanding unconditional contractual commitments, including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods, amounted to $\n93.6\nmillion, the majority of which is to be paid in the next two years, with $\n48.3\nmillion due to be paid in 2022.\nWe have letters of credit totaling $\n2.4\nmillion supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers. Our accrual for insurance obligations was $\n3.1\nmillion at December 31, 2021, of which $\n0.9\nmillion is in excess of our deductible and, therefore, is reimbursable by the insurance company.\nNote 19:\nSegment Information\nOur business operations are organized into\ntwo\nreportable segments, Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. Our Proprietary Products reportable segment offers proprietary packaging, containment and drug delivery products, along with analytical lab services and other integrated services and solutions, primarily to biologic, generic and pharmaceutical drug customers. Our Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment serves as a fully integrated business, focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex devices, primarily for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers.\n85\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") evaluates the performance of our segments based upon, among other things, segment net sales and operating profit. Segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs, which include executive and director compensation, stock-based compensation, certain pension and other retirement benefit costs, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. Also excluded are items that the CODM considers not representative of ongoing operations. Such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments and other specifically-identified income or expense items. The segment operating profit metric is what the CODM uses in evaluating our results of operations and the financial measure that provides a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position.\nThe following table presents net sales information about our reportable segments, reconciled to consolidated totals:\nThe intersegment sales elimination, which is required for the presentation of consolidated net sales, represents the elimination of components sold between our segments.\nWe do not have any customers accounting for greater than 10% of consolidated net sales.\nThe following table presents net sales and long-lived assets, by the country in which the legal subsidiary is domiciled and assets are located:\n86\n(1) Corporate general costs includes executive and director compensation, certain pension and other retirement benefit costs, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments.\n(2) During 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a restructuring and severance related charge of $\n2.2\nmillion and $\n7.0\nmillion, respectively, to optimize certain organizational structure within the Company. During 2019, the Company recorded $\n4.9\nmillion in restructuring and related charges in connection with the 2018 plan.\n(3) During 2021, the company recorded $\n0.8\nmillion of amortization expense within operating profit associated with an acquisition of an intangible asset during the second quarter of 2020. During 2020, the company recorded $\n0.6\nmillion of amortization expense within operating profit associated with an acquisition of an intangible asset during the second quarter of 2020.\n(4) The Company recorded a $\n2.8\nmillion impairment charge for certain long-lived and intangible assets within the Proprietary Products segment as it determined the carrying value was not fully recoverable. $\n1.9\nmillion of this charge is recorded in Cost of Goods Sold and $\n0.9\nmillion of the charge is recorded in Selling, General, and Administrative expense, due to the nature of the impaired assets.\n(5) During 2021, the net cost investment activity was equal to $\n4.3\nmillion, inclusive of an impairment charge of $\n4.6\nmillion partially offset by a $\n0.3\nmillion gain on the sale of a cost investment. During 2020, the Company recorded a cost investment impairment charge of $\n2.5\nmillion.\n(6) During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a net tax recovery of $\n4.4\nmillion related to previously-paid international excise taxes, following a favorable court ruling.\nPlease refer to Note 16,\n, for further discussion of unallocated items.\n87\nThe following tables provide summarized financial information for our\ntwo\nreportable segments and corporate and unallocated:\n88\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo\nthe Board of Directors and Shareholders of West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\n89\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nAs described in Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated deferred tax assets were $92.2 million, net of a valuation allowance of $12.2 million, as of December 31, 2021, and income tax expense was $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a global organization, the Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As disclosed by management, management estimates income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities. The enacted statutory tax rate applied is based on the rate expected to be applicable at the time of the forecasted utilization of the loss carryforward or reversal of the temporary difference. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The realizability of deferred tax assets is subject to estimates of future taxable income, generally at the respective subsidiary company and the country level.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the provision for income taxes is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the income tax provision due to the Company’s global footprint and complexity in the various tax laws applicable in determining the Company’s effective tax rate. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence related to the income tax provision. Also, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to income taxes, including controls over the determination of the income tax provision. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the income tax provision, including testing the Company’s rate reconciliation, return to provision adjustments, permanent and temporary differences, and financial data used in the income tax provision calculation, and (ii) testing the accuracy of the income tax rates utilized in the provision. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management’s application of relevant income tax law in certain jurisdictions.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 22, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1963.\n90"

Disclosure controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls include some, but not all, components of our internal control over financial reporting.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the framework established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards\nto reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n91"
